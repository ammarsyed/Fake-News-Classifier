0,China and Russia Optimistic over Iran Talks as Biden Envoy Sits on Sidelines,"The governments of China and Russia, which appear to be taking the lead in talks between Iran and the remaining partners in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, expressed optimism after talks concluded on Friday for the week that progress had occurred.

The conversations over the agreement formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) began this week in Vienna, Austria. Representatives from China, Russia, and Iran — as well as the United Kingdom, France, and Germany — met to discuss, they claimed, a way to repair what remains of the agreement after years of violations by Tehran and President Donald Trump withdrawing the United States from it in 2018. Notably absent from the invitation list was the United States, which had no formal representation in this week’s talks.

The administration of President Joe Biden claimed it would engage in “indirect” talks with Iran and sent its special envoy on the matter, Robert Malley, to Vienna. Iranian officials clarified Tuesday, however, that “no negotiations will take place between the representatives of Iran and the United States” and no talks of any kind, direct or otherwise, would take place this week.

Malley is staying in a separate hotel in Vienna from where the Iran deal talks are occurring and appears to have met only with officials not privy to the negotiations, including representatives of the Austrian government and the International Atomic Energy Organization (IAEA).

With no input from Washington, Iran has used the talks to vocally and repeatedly insist that it will not begin to discuss returning to compliance on the JCPOA with the United States unless the Biden administration immediately lifts all sanctions on Iran, not just those regarding the nuclear weapons issue. This would presumably include the accurate branding of Iran as a State Sponsor of Terrorism due to its international support of Hezbollah, a Shiite jihadist organization, and its involvement in deadly attacks on civilians such as the 1994 bombing of Argentine-Israeli Mutual Association (AMIA) in Buenos Aires.

A Russian representative to the IAEA branded this “progress” on Friday.

“The #JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) participants took stock of the work done by experts over the last three days and noted with satisfaction the initial progress made,” Mikhail Ulyanov wrote on Twitter. “The Commission will reconvene next week in order to maintain the positive momentum.”

“All parties have narrowed down their differences and we do see the momentum for gradually evolving consensus,” Wang Qun, China’s ambassador to the IAEA, agreed, according to Reuters.

Both nations have loudly condemned unilateral sanctions on any country and, in particular, opposed American sanctions on their ally Iran.

“The justified request of the injured party, rather than the offending party, should be confirmed and satisfied first. This is a basic right-or-wrong question,” Qun said Tuesday. “The U.S. should lift all sanctions against Tehran and on this basis, Iran can resume full compliance to the nuclear deal.”

Reuters reported American officials claim they are “being briefed” on the talks they were not invited to, without elaborating.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, made clear he had no appetite for negotiation Thursday, the day before Moscow and Beijing declared the talks had yielded “progress.”

“Verification [of US sanctions removal] means [being capable of] selling oil in an official manner, with ease and under normal conditions, and its money be received by Iran,” Khamenei insisted, again making the case for the lifting of sanctions unrelated to the nuclear agreement. Khamenei also accused “the signatories of the nuclear agreement,” without discriminating among them, of having violated the deal and claimed “Tehran is in no hurry for Washington to come back to the nuclear agreement” in a video posted to Instagram.

“Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said other signatories to the deal have no right to set conditions for Tehran as long as they have not fulfilled their obligations, emphasizing that this is Iran’s definitive policy from which Tehran will not step back,” Iran’s PressTV reported.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry also took the opportunity Thursday to boast of its heightened uranium enrichment abilities.

“Our 20% enrichment is now moving even faster than the speed envisaged by the Islamic Consultative Assembly (the Iranian Parliament) in its law, and 20% enriched materials are being produced now,” Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi claimed, stating that the enrichment, which violates the nuclear deal, would continue until the United States lifted all existing sanctions on Iran.

“Araqchi also denied indirect talks with Washington through the European parties to the JCPOA, saying the talks involve China and Russia in addition to the Europeans,” PressTV added.

State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters in a contentious exchange Thursday that the Biden administration would not repeal sanctions unrelated to the nuclear deal, such as those related to human rights abuses against the Iranian people.

“We believe that Iran’s ballistic missile program, that Iran’s violation of the — Iran’s human rights abuses, that Iran’s support for malign proxies, Iran’s support for terrorism — we believe all of those things pose a profound challenge to us as well as to our regional partners,” Price said. That is why we will continue, including through sanctions, to push back on those issues.”

When a reporter replied, “Well, why couldn’t you have said this like yesterday or the day before?” Price insisted he “absolutely did” and again repeated that sanctions “will continue to be important tools” for confronting Tehran.

Price also insisted Malley was in discussions “right now with our European allies and our Russian and Chinese partners in this endeavor,” a claim for which no evidence exists and one that the allies and partners in question have not confirmed on the record.

Malley has been documenting his activities in Vienna on Twitter, which appear to be meetings with Austrian government leaders — who are not a party to the JCPOA — and the IAEA.

Russian and Chinese officials said on Friday that they expect talks to resume next week. Price noted Thursday that he expects Malley back in Washington this weekend.",1
1,Joe Biden Signs Executive Order to Study Packing the Supreme Court,"The White House announced President Joe Biden would sign an executive order Friday creating a commission to study reform ideas for the U.S. Supreme Court.

“The Commission’s purpose is to provide an analysis of the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform, including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals,” the White House said in a statement. The panel includes experts on constitutional law, history, and political science, the White House added.

The announcement partially addresses a presidential campaign promise from Biden as the left repeatedly pressured him to pack the court with additional justices to diminish its growing conservative majority, including three justices nominated by former President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate.

In October 2020, Biden said in an interview he would put together a “bipartisan commission” to address the Supreme Court “because it’s getting out of whack.”",1
2,Joe Biden Releases $1.52 Trillion Budget Proposal with Partisan Pork,"President Joe Biden released his first budget request to Congress on Friday, asking for big spending increases for domestic spending programs and leftist causes.

Biden’s budget requests a 16 percent increase in domestic spending from 2021, including a 41 percent increase for the Department of Education, a 28 percent increase for the Department of Commerce, and a 23.5 percent increase for the Department of Health and Human Services.

“These are just a handful of the significant new public investments that would result in a healthier, safer, more prosperous, and more just future for all Americans,” Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget Shalanda D. Young wrote in a letter to Congress.

The 58-page discretionary request released Friday details some of Biden’s budgetary priorities for the upcoming fiscal year. The administration is expected to release a more detailed budget later in the year.

The administration boasted an increase of more than $14 billion in spending requests to reduce climate change and “the largest direct investment in environmental justice in history.”

That includes $1.7 billion for “energy-saving retrofits” of schools, homes, and federal buildings, and $600 million for electric vehicles and charging stations for federal agencies. It also requests more than $10 billion in “clean energy” innovation. The request also calls for $936 million in spending toward a new Accelerating Environmental and Economic Justice Initiative at the Environmental Protection Agency.

Other spending priorities include $2.1 billion in funding to combat gun violence, as well as funding for states to incentivize “voluntary gun buyback pilot programs.”

The budget proposal also includes a massive increase in government Pell grants, including funds available to illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children under Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA).

The budget request calls for $861 million in assistance for Central American countries to address the “root causes” of migration from those countries.

The proposal calls for only small increases in funding for national security, including a 1.5 percent increase in funding for the Department of Defense, including funds “promoting climate resilience” and deterring China and Russia. The Department of Homeland Security funding request remains largely the same as 2021 funding.",1
3,"Radical Left's Infrastructure Bill Wish List Includes Climate Change, Amnesty","Members of the radical left have released a wish list of items they hope are incorporated in the next infrastructure bill, prioritizing climate change initiatives and mass amnesty.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) surveyed its 95 members, which include far-left members of the “Squad” — Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) — and released a list of priorities the CPC as a whole is advancing at the current stage of infrastructure discussions. The list includes five key areas, which include beefing up government-run health care and tackling climate-related issues while providing amnesty for millions of illegal immigrants.

The leftists identified investments and climate jobs as a top agenda item, demanding at least 40 percent of investment funds to go to “communities on the frontlines of our economic, environmental, and public health crises.”

The leftists called for the establishment of what they dubbed a “Strong National Clean Energy Standard,” which they believe will create “millions of clean jobs in the renewable energy sector to help meet emissions reductions through binding, enforceable federal clean-energy standards.”

Additionally, the CPC called for the incorporation of a climate jobs program, which they said will “directly put Americans to work serving the public interest, including the robust funding of a Civilian Climate Corps, Public Health Jobs Corps, and Resilience Job Corps.”

They also called for a sizeable investment in resources “required” to address climate change.

The CPC identified mass amnesty, or the “Roadmap for Citizenship and Inclusion for Immigrant Communities,” as another top priority, demanding a roadmap to citizenship for “essential workers, TPS recipients, and Dreamers.”

“Strengthen the Care Economy” is listed as another priority. The CPC called for a $450 billion investment in Medicaid home and community-based services (HCBS) to help Biden’s stated support of creating jobs in the home care industry. Such jobs, the CPC said, should pay $15 an hour. Additionally, childcare access should be a “universal benefit,” and leaders should establish permanent paid family and medical leave, they said.

The caucus also demands a focus on housing, urging any infrastructure plan to include “Guarantee Housing Choice Vouchers” for all eligible Americans. They should “convert the funding status from annual appropriations to mandatory spending,” the CPC added.

Additionally, the CPC asked for $70 billion to “address the public housing repair backlog” and $45 billion “for the National Housing Trust Fund per year.” The leftists also demand to “make weatherization and energy efficiency upgrades consistent with the Green New Deal for Public Housing.”

Lowering drug prices rounds out the list of priorities, with the CPC asking to ” improve on H.R. 3 in a manner recommended by drug pricing advocates and the Biden-Sanders Unity Taskforce.” Recommendations include expanding the “numbers and types of drugs eligible for negotiation, launch prices, and inflation caps” and capping drug prices “at the average price in other OECD countries.”

“We agree that it’s time for transformative change and we look forward to working with the Biden Administration to expand on their proposal and ensure that the American Jobs Plan goes big to truly meet the needs of the public,” Caucus chair Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) said in a statement that comes amid reports of the Biden White House working on courting far-left members of the Democrat caucus.

Democrat Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) triggered a wave of reactions after identifying paid leave, child care, and caregiving as infrastructure in a Wednesday tweet, which she doubled down on a follow-up tweet on Friday:

Paid leave is infrastructure.

Child care is infrastructure.

Caregiving is infrastructure. — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 7, 2021

Americans agree:

Paid leave is infrastructure.

Child care is infrastructure.

Caregiving is infrastructure. And they want us to invest in all three. So let's get it done. pic.twitter.com/UFUtGaANhy — Kirsten Gillibrand (@SenGillibrand) April 9, 2021

President Biden outlined his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan last month, deeming it a “once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago.”

“Democrats aren’t serious about fixing America’s infrastructure,” National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair said in a statement. “They’re serious about passing their socialist agenda by any means necessary.”",1
4,Joe Biden Border Czar Roberta Jacobson Stepping Down,"President Joe Biden’s “border czar” will leave the White House, as the administration continues struggling to handle the migration crisis on the Southern border.

Former U.S. ambassador to Mexico Roberta S. Jacobson, who was appointed by Biden to lead the diplomatic effort in Central America, will leave her position at the end of April, she revealed to the New York Times.

News of Jacobson’s resignation broke after Biden appointed Vice President Kamala Harris as the point person for the border crisis, particularly on diplomatic negotiations with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.

Jacobson told the Times she was not resigning because of Harris’s role, stressing she was only expected to serve in her position for 100 days.

“Nobody could be more delighted to see the vice president take on that role,” she told the Times. “It didn’t have anything to do with my decision.”

Jacobson had only one public speaking appearance in the White House, joining a press briefing with reporters in March to discuss the border crisis.

During the briefing, she partially attributed the surge of migrants to the election of President Biden and his policies.

“Surges tend to respond to hope, and there was a significant hope for a more humane policy after four years of, you know, pent-up demand,” she said.

She also mistakenly said in Spanish the “border was not closed” before correcting herself during the briefing.

Jacobson previously resigned as an ambassador in 2018 in protest of former President Donald Trump’s border policies before she was appointed to the Biden administration.",1
5,Mexico Tells Biden: Expect ‘Constant and Growing’ Migration,"More migrants are coming to the United States, and the solution is more U.S. foreign aid to Central America, says Mexico’s foreign minister.

“If you look at the region from different points of view, but especially demographics and economics, it is clear the flows are going to be constant and growing in coming years,” said foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard, according to an Associated Press April 8 report.

“The United States will have to allocate $2 billion per year for development in these countries, in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador,” said Ebrard, who is involved in the slow-motion negotiations with the White House about the migration surge into the United States.

The $2 billion per year is roughly twice as much money as the $1 billion per year that President Joe Biden has suggested the U.S. should spend in Central America.

But Biden’s offer of $1 billion is equivalent to just $30.22 per person in Central America — and is only a tiny slice of the economic damage caused by U.S. extraction-migration policies to ordinary Americans, Mexicans, and the people in Central America.

More importantly, there is little evidence the U.S. wants to stop migration from Central America, said Rob Law, the director of regulatory affairs and policy at the Center for Immigration Studies.

Many U.S. business groups and donors want to extract migrants from nearby countries because they stimulate the U.S. economy, minimize wage gains by Americans, pump up consumer sales, and boost rental prices. The 2021 inflow under Biden’s border welcome is likely to add roughly 1 million people — or about one migrant for every four Americans who turn 18 and begin looking for jobs.

Biden’s extraction-migration policy is also damaging to Mexico, said Law, because it “just gets trampled on by caravans and further fuels, the integration of the [armed] cartels and the [migrant-smuggling] coyotes.” Law added:

Mexico is trying to really figure out what the actual [White House] position is because there’s so much wink and nod language coming out of the Bible administration. [U.S. officials] say they don’t want the border crisis, and say they’re sending all of this [aid] money down to address root causes [in Central America], even though the root cause is the Biden administration itself.

By rewarding the movement of migrants into the United States, Biden’s White House is “colonizing Central America by extracting the populations and bringing them here, so destroying those [Central American] countries,” said Law.

In March, Biden handed the migration portfolio to Vice President Kamala Harris, who has enthusiastically supported migration from Central America into the United States. Since then, her staff has claimed she is trying to resolve the “root causes” of migration, but not to curb the current inflow.

This week the State Department also torpedoed negotiations with Nayid Bukele, the popular president of El Salvador. The very popular president has urged the United States to help stop young people’s migration from El Salvador to U.S. workplaces. Migration “is bad for the United States because immigration will go up, and it’s bad for our country because [of] people leaving the country … so it’s bad for both of us,” he told Fox News’s Tucker Carlson in March.

In contrast, former President Donald Trump moved decisively in 2019 by pressuring Mexico to block the flow of migrants into the United States. Trump’s policy raised Americans’ wages and also proved very popular in Mexico, where many people oppose the cartel-aided trafficking of migrants across Mexico into the U.S. economy.

Sen. Manchin represents 1.6 million Americans in a very poor state, yet he endorses an unpopular 2021 amnesty that will divert investment & wages to other states.

Closed-door pressure & incentives may explain his weak ""for the children"" claim. https://t.co/3rmE9y4vZ5 — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) April 2, 2021

The $2 billion per year in foreign aid suggested by Mexico is a large amount of money — but is a tiny share of the annual cost of legal and illegal migration.

For example, migrants cost state and local governments roughly $57 billion per year, according to a 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences.

But that is good for U.S. business because the taxpayers’ $57 billion in extra welfare, education, and healthcare spending eventually end up in company revenues.

This month, New York’s government allocated $2.1 billion to the poor migrants who support the city’s elite-run economy. The resulting payout of $15,600 per illegal migrant helps to preserve a labor force that allows city elites to extract wealth and political power from blue-collar and white-collar Americans.

Joseph Salvo, New York City’s chief demographer, told the New York Times why the city of eight million needs new bodies to replace the legal and illegal migrants who exited the city because of the coronavirus crash:

In the pandemic, [migrants] are trying to make a living and coming home and living in close proximity to other people. And they work the cash-only jobs, service jobs, services in buildings, home health aides, that we start to lose. Our growth is going to depend on giving support to these immigrants, many of whom suffered and lost family members. … What we pray will happen is that the city will come back with a ferocity we have never seen in food, beverage, entertainment and hotels. All of that is going to come back. And hopefully the immigrant population will prosper because of that. That’s the key. … The city is 37 percent foreign-born, and if you add the next generation, it’s more than 50 percent. We have more than three million immigrants. The largest groups are from China, Dominican Republic and Mexico.

“The city will rise — It will rise through the power of immigration,” Salvo said.

If Biden does not supply the city with a new wave of needy low-wage migrants, the city’s business and government leaders will have to attract young Americans from interior states with offers of higher wages, better housing, and improved law enforcement.

In effect, Biden’s policy helps elites and investors hire foreigners and ignore Americans from poor states and regions, such as Sen. Joe Manchin’s West Virginia.

For years, GOP leaders — such as Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) or Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) — have done nothing to stop the nation’s migration system from shifting wealth from interior GOP-led states to the Democrat-run coastal states.

Correspondingly, Americans would gain economically if the U.S. government paid poor people in the Central American countries to stay home and build up their own economies, writes David North, an analyst with Law’s Center for Immigration Studies.

The U.S. should offer vaccinations and cash to young people in Central America “in exchange for a pledge on the part of the recipients that they would make no effort to come to the U.S., legally or illegally, in the following two or three years.”

He added, “In exchange for these benefits, they would sign a piece of paper permitting their immediate deportation should they be found in the U.S.”

For many years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.

The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.

The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money away from most Americans.

It moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.",1
6,‘A Great Man in Both War and Peace’: Tributes to Prince Philip,"Condolences have poured in from around the world following news of the passing of Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and the consort of Queen Elizabeth II.

World War Two veteran Prince Philip, born Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark on the island of Corfu on June 10th, 1921, died on Friday, two months before marking his 100th birthday.

Very sad to see the death of Prince Philip. He was a great man in both war and peace. All of our thoughts are with our magnificent Queen. — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) April 9, 2021

Brexit leader Nigel Farage wrote of the news on April 9th: “Very sad to see the death of Prince Philip. He was a great man in both war and peace. All of our thoughts are with our magnificent Queen.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country was united “both in grief and gratitude; grief at Prince Philip’s passing, and gratitude for his decades of selfless service to the country”.

Their marriage has been a symbol of strength, stability and hope, even as the world around them changed – most recently during the pandemic. It was a partnership that inspired millions in Britain and beyond. — Keir Starmer (@Keir_Starmer) April 9, 2021

Labour leader Keir Starmer remarked with sadness that the UK had lost “an extraordinary public servant in Prince Philip” who had “dedicated his life to our country”.

Ben Harris-Quinney, chairman of the UK’s oldest conservative think tank The Bow Group told Breitbart London: “If you had to select ten figures that have had the most significant effect on shaping Britain over the past 100 years, it would be hard not to place Prince Philip among them.

“Prime ministers and governments come and go, but Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been not only symbols of Britain, but leaders of Britain.”

Leaders of Commonwealth countries also shared their sympathies including the prime minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, called the Duke of Edinburgh “a man of great purpose and conviction, who was motivated by a sense of duty to others, Prince Philip contributed so much to the social fabric of our country – and the world.”

Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the Duke’s commitment to the Commonwealth, noting he had been a patron to over 50 Australian organisations and had a “strong connection with the Australian Defence Force.”

7,Joe Biden Delayed in Sending Condolences After Death of Prince Philip,"President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden issued a tardy statement of condolences to the United Kingdom in response to the death of Prince Philip on Friday.

The news of The Duke of Edinburgh’s death broke early Friday morning but it took more than four hours for the Biden White House to issue a statement to the United Kingdom, frequently described by leaders of both countries as one of America’s closest allies.

Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison was among the first leaders with a statement within the hour of the news. Several other foreign leaders issued statements to offer condolences before the Bidens including Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and India Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Former President George W. Bush did not wait for Biden before sending his own condolences after the news, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a statement hours before Biden’s statement was released.

The delay from the Bidens prompted some criticism from Nigel Farage, the author of Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, and former leader of both the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the Brexit Party.

“As global leaders offer the Queen condolences on the death of Prince Philip, there is not a word from the US President or his Vice,” Farage wrote on social media at 10:25 a.m. “This despite US media full of the story. Biden and the Democrats do not like the UK.”

The statement from the Bidens was released at 11:10 a.m., about 15 minutes after Breitbart News inquired about the timing for the Biden family’s expression of condolences.

The statement read:

On behalf of all the people of the United States, we send our deepest condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, the entire Royal Family, and all the people of the United Kingdom on the death of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh. Over the course of his 99-year life, he saw our world change dramatically and repeatedly. From his service during World War II, to his 73 years alongside the Queen, and his entire life in the public eye — Prince Philip gladly dedicated himself to the people of the UK, the Commonwealth, and to his family. The impact of his decades of devoted public service is evident in the worthy causes he lifted up as patron, in the environmental efforts he championed, in the members of the Armed Forces that he supported, in the young people he inspired, and so much more. His legacy will live on not only through his family, but in all the charitable endeavors he shaped. Jill and I are keeping the Queen and to Prince Philip’s children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren in our hearts during this time.

First Lady Jill Biden’s spokesman Michael LaRosa spoke about the first lady’s relationship with the royal family during a trip to Alabama, noting that she had never met Prince Philip.

“She has a close relationship with Harry, and her heart is with him and the family today,” LaRosa said.

8,Derek Chauvin Defense Uses Forensic Pathologist Cross-examination to Support George Floyd Overdose Theory,"Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas testified Friday at the trial of former Minneapolis, Minnesota, police officer Derek Chauvin that absent a struggle with police, the death of a person with the drugs George Floyd had in his system would have been ruled an overdose.

Defense attorney Eric Nelson cross-examined Thomas, a witness for the prosecution, after she had testified that the “primary mechanism of death” in the case was “asphyxia or low oxygen.”

Nelson was careful to ask about the level of drugs, because prosecutors have suggested the levels in Floyd’s body were low.

Nelson: So again, just kind of taking into consideration, removing certain variables, right, you find a person at home, no struggle with the police, right, and the person doesn’t have a heart problem, yet you find fentanyl and methamphetamine in this person’s system at the levels they are, would you certify this as an overdose ? Dr. Thomas: Again, in the absence of any of these other realities, yes, I could consider that to be an overdose. Nelson: And the level of fentanyl in a person — again, in this hypothetical scenario — there are deaths certified as drug overdoses significantly lower than 11 nanograms per milliliter ? Dr. Thomas: Lower, higher. it’s got a huge range, yes. Nelson: As low, I believe, as three percent or three nanograms per milliliter? Dr. Thomas: Yes. Nelson: So the ingestion of drugs is unique to that individual’s body, right? Dr. Thomas: Right. Nelson: I have no further questions.

Other experts have testified for the prosecution that Floyd died from a lack of oxygen caused by Chauvin kneeling on his neck.

But the prosecution has shifted its theory from arguing that Chauvin cut off the flow of blood in Floyd’s arteries, and began referring to a knee placed on Floyd’s “neck area” rather than the neck itself, following earlier cross-examinations.

9,"Medical Examiner Testifies That Heart Problems, Drugs Were Factors in George Floyd’s Death","Chief Hennepin County Medical Examiner Dr. Andrew Baker testified Friday afternoon in the trial of former Minnesota police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis that heart disease and drugs were contributing factors in the death of George Floyd.

Baker, who conducted the autopsy on Floyd, had listed the cause of death on Floyd’s death certificate as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.”

But he also had noted “contributing conditions” on Floyd’s death certificate, including “arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease; fentanyl intoxication; recent methamphetamine use.”

Under cross-examination by defense attorney Eric Nelson, Baker said that other factors had been significant enough to note:

Dr. Baker: So when you put those [contributing conditions] on a death certificate, as a physician, what you are saying is I think these played some role in his death. They had a contributing condition. iI’m unaware of how the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] would mandate what goes on there. Presumably, the goal is you put things on there that you believe are relevant. You don’t list trivial stuff on there that didn’t play a role. Nelson: And so if something was significant enough, you put it on, but if it’s insignificant, and didn’t contribute, you leave it off? Dr. Baker: Generally, yes. Nelson: And so, in your opinion, both the heart disease as well as the history of hypertension ,and the drugs that were in his system, played a role in Mr. Floyd’s death? Dr. Baker: In my opinion, yes.

Baker also testified that Chauvin’s knee had not blocked the carotid arteries carrying oxygen to Floyd’s brain, as prosecutors had suggested earlier.

In addition, Baker noted that he had conducted the autopsy before watching the viral video of Floyd’s arrest, because he said he did not want to be biased in his examination. He watched it before releasing the body the following day, and noted that if he had found additional factors in Floyd’s death, he would have had time to add them to his report.

Later, Baker said that he had certified overdose deaths in which levels of fentanyl were lower than they were in George Floyd.

He said that had Floyd been home alone, “with no evidence of trauma,” he would have ruled his death an overdose.

However, on re-direct by the prosecution, he said that his opinion was that the encounter with police was the main reason for Floyd’s death.

10,Gretchen Whitmer Asks Michiganders to Avoid Indoor Dining for Two Weeks,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and state health officials asked residents on Friday to avoid indoor dining and gave additional recommendations.

In order to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Whitmer is urging high schools to move to remote learning, asking diners to use outdoor dining or takeout, and recommending youth sports pause in-person activities for two weeks, WLUC reported.

During the press conference, the governor stated:

We all have to step up our game for the next two weeks to bring down rising cases. And that’s why I’m calling on high schools to voluntarily go remote for two weeks past spring break, calling on youth sports to voluntarily suspend games and practices for two weeks. And I’m strongly encouraging all Michiganders to avoid dining indoors and avoid gathering with friends indoors for two weeks. Support your local restaurants by eating outside, or getting carry out instead of dining indoors. Opt for small, outdoor gatherings with masks.

“To be very clear, these are not orders, mandates, or requirements. A year in, we all know what works and this has to be a team effort. We have to do this together. Lives depend on it,” she continued.

The governor and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun added the state will administer five million doses of the coronavirus vaccine by the close of Friday.

When asked why it appears the Biden administration is not surging vaccines to her state, Whitmer said it is sending “things to support us whether it’s therapeutics or mobile testing and vaccination ability or boots on the ground.”

“But we are going to continue to fight for additional vaccines. That is not a policy that they have embraced at this juncture but I’m going to continue to fight for our state,” Whitmer noted.

“I believe that a surge strategy is prudent, equitable, and important, and that’s the case that I’m making to the head of the COVID [coronavirus] response team in the administration,” she added.

The state topped the nation’s daily tally of recent coronavirus cases this week despite its mask mandate, Breitbart News reported Tuesday.",1
11,"Top Gretchen Whitmer Aide Takes Spring Break Trip to Florida, Ignoring MI Gov’s Warning","A top aide to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) traveled to Florida for spring break this week, according to photos she purportedly posted on Facebook.

Tricia L. Foster, who was appointed by Whitmer as the state’s Chief Operations Officer, posted several photos from the Florida Keys, according to screenshots obtained by Breitbart News:

One friend commented that she thought she saw the senior Michigan government official on the beach in Siesta Key.

“I swear I saw you walking today,” the person said on a purported Foster Facebook post containing several beach photos from earlier this week.

“Likely,” Foster responded.

When asked where one of her absent family members was — apparently her son — Foster responded, “home with covid [coronavirus].”

She added, “Missing his [senior] trip to the Bahamas so planned girls plan b 24 hours before flight.”

On April 3, just days before Foster purportedly left the state, Whitmer urged Michiganders to avoid spring break trips to Florida, WVPE reported:

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says a factor in Michigan’s surging COVID-19 cases is fewer people were infected earlier in the pandemic than in other states. She also is concerned about spring break travel, particularly to Florida. Florida and Michigan have reported the highest and second-highest number of cases of a more contagious variant that was first identified in the U.K. Michigan had the United States’ worst infection rate in the past two weeks. Whitmer on Friday recommended that people get tested after in-state, out-of-state or international travel. She continues to emphasize vaccinations to help end the pandemic.

During a Friday press conference, Whitmer acknowledged she and her administration met with President Joe Biden to make the case for a “vaccine surge” but indicated she was rebuffed by her political ally.

Via WOOD TV:

The White House said Friday it is surging federal resources to support vaccinations, testing and therapeutics — but not vaccines — to Michigan in an effort to control the state’s worst-in-the-nation COVID-19 transmission rate. President Joe Biden outlined the moves late Thursday in a call with Whitmer to discuss the situation, according to senior administration officials. But it will not include a “surge” of vaccine doses, a move Whitmer has advocated for, and again pushed during Friday’s news conference.

Foster was tasked in January with implementing Whitmer’s vaccine rollout strategy, according to WCMU. She blamed the Trump administration for Michigan’s lagging distribution process.

It is not clear whether she participated in the meeting or was still on her Florida vacation.

An email to Whitmer’s press office was not immediately returned.

12,How Prince Philip’s Mother Saved Jews from the Holocaust,"Prince Philip, who passed away at the age of 99 a day after Israel commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day, was born to Princess Alice of Battenberg, a woman who is remembered for sheltering Jews during the Second World War.

Princess Alice, who was also the great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, is beloved in Israel for sheltering a Jewish family and was honored by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial as a “Righteous among the Nations,” an accolade for those who saved Jewish people during the Holocaust.

According to Yad Vashem‘s website:

The Greek royal family had been well acquainted with the family of Haimaki Cohen, a Jew and former member of Parliament, from Tricala, in northern Greece. In 1941, when Germany invaded Greece, the family fled to Athens – then still under Italian rule, where the anti-Jewish policy was more moderate. However the period of relative saftely lasted only until September 1943, when following Italy’s surrender to the Allies, the Germans occupied Athens and the hunt for Jews began. By that time Haimaki Cohen had died. His widow, Rachel, and her five children were looking for a place of refuge. The family’s four sons wanted to cross to Egypt, and join with the Greek government in exile that was in Cairo. But the trip proved too hazardous for Rachel and their sister. Princess Alice heard of the family’s desparate situation and offered to shelter Rachel and her daughter, Tilde, at her home. They were later joined by another son who was unable to make the journey to Egypt and had to return to Athens.

In 1994, Princess Alice was honored in a ceremony at Yad Vashem attended by her son, Prince Philip.

Prince Philip said at the ceremony no one in the family was aware his mother had hidden the Cohen family.

“In retrospect, this reticence may seem strange, but I suspect that it never occurred to her that her action was in any way special. She would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress,” Prince Philip said at the time.

“The Holocaust was the most horrific event in all Jewish history, and it will remain in the memory of all future generations. It is, therefore, a very generous gesture that also remembered here are the many millions of non-Jews, like my mother, who shared in your pain and anguish and did what they could in small ways to alleviate the horror,” he added.",1
13,"DMX, Rapper and Actor, Has Died at 50","NEW YORK (AP) — DMX, the raspy-voiced hip-hop artist who produced the songs “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem” and “Party Up (Up in Here)” and who rapped with a trademark delivery that was often paired with growls, barks and “What!” as an ad-lib, has died, according to a statement from his family. He was 50.

The Grammy-nominated performer died after suffering “catastrophic cardiac arrest,” according to the hospital in White Plains, New York, where he died. He was rushed there from his home April 2.

A statement from relatives said he died “with his family by his side after being placed on life support for the past few days.”

The rapper, whose real name is Earl Simmons, had struggled with drug addiction since his teenage years. His lawyer, Murray Richman, had earlier said he could not confirm reports that DMX overdosed.

DMX made a splash in rap music in 1998 with his first studio album, “It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,” which debuted No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. The multiplatinum-selling album was anchored by several hits including “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem,” “Get At Me Dog,” “Stop Being Greedy” and “How It’s Goin’ Down.”

DMX followed up with four straight chart-topping albums including “… And Then There Was X,” “Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood,” “The Great Depression” and “Grand Champ.” He released seven albums, earned three Grammy nominations and was named favorite rap/hip-hop artist at the 2000 American Music Awards.

DMX arrived on the rap scene around the same time as Jay-Z, Ja Rule and others who dominated the charts and emerged as platinum-selling acts. They were all part of rap crews, too: DMX fronted the Ruff Ryders collective, which helped launch the careers of Grammy winners Eve and Swizz Beatz, and relaunch The Lox, formerly signed to Bad Boy Records. Ruff Ryders had success on the charts and on radio with its “Ryde or Die” compilation albums.

Along with his musical career, DMX paved his way as an actor. He starred in the 1998 film “Belly” and appeared in 2000′s “Romeo Must Die” with Jet Li and Aaliyah. DMX and Aaliyah teamed up for “Come Back in One Piece” on the film’s soundtrack.

The rapper would later open Aaliyah’s tribute music video, “Miss You,” alongside her other friends and collaborators, including Missy Elliott, Lil’ Kim and Queen Latifah, after Aaliyah’s 2001 death in a plane crash at age 22.

The rapper also starred in 2001′s “Exit Wounds” with Steven Seagal and 2003′s “Cradle 2 the Grave” with Li.

But while DMX made his mark as one of hip-hop’s most recognizable names for his rap artistry and as an actor, the rapper was personally stifled by his legal battles — he was repeatedly arrested and jailed within a decade — and drug addiction. His addiction first took hold at age 14 when smoked a marijuana cigarette that was laced with cocaine.

DMX pleaded guilty in 2004 after he posed as an undercover federal agent a nd crashed his SUV through a security gate at New York’s Kennedy Airport. He was arrested in 2008 on drug and animal cruelty charges following an overnight raid on his house in Phoenix. He tried to barricade himself in his bedroom but emerged when a SWAT team entered his home.

In 2010, he was sentenced to a year in prison for violating terms of his probation. After he was admitted to rehab numerous times over the next year, he said he had finally beat his drug addiction.

First responders helped bring DMX back to life after he was found in a hotel parking lot in New York in 2016. The rapper said he suffered from asthma.

A couple years later, DMX was sentenced to a year in prison for tax fraud. Prosecutors said he concocted a multiyear scheme to hide millions of dollars in income from the IRS and get around nearly $2 million in tax liabilities.

After his release, DMX planned a 32-date tour to mark the 20th anniversary of “It’s Dark and Hell is Hot.” But the rapper canceled a series of shows to check himself into a rehab facility in 2019. In an Instagram post, his team said he apologized for the canceled shows and thanked his fans for the continued support.

Besides his legal troubles, DMX took the initiative to help the less fortunate. He gave a group of Philadelphia men advice during a surprise appearance at a homeless support group meeting in 2017, and helped a Maine family with its back-to-school purchases a couple years later.

Last year, DMX faced off against Snoop Dogg in a Verzuz battle, which drew more than 500,000 viewers.",1
14,"Hate Hoax: Black Albion College Student Accused of Racist, Antisemitic Graffiti","Albion College in Albion, Michigan, told Breitbart News that “the individual responsible for the racist graffiti” in a dormitory on campus “is a student of color.” The incident makes for another hate hoax carried out on a college campus.

A 21-year-old black student allegedly admitted responsibility for most of the racist and antisemitic graffiti that was discovered in a dorm stairwell on campus after Albion police brought him in for questioning on Tuesday, according to a report by MLive.

The report added that police said video evidence from Albion’s Campus Safety Department confirms the statements made by the student.

The graffiti in question had included multiple references to the KKK, as well as a Star of David with the numbers “666” written across it. Some of the words graffitied included phrases such as, “KKK white power,” “Albion is racist we do exist KKK,” and “Die N*****s please!”

Breaking: Last week, shocking racist messages appeared on the campus of @albioncollege in Mich., prompting a large response from the administration. The FBI was even put on standby. Today, Albion police announced that a black student admitted to the crimes.https://t.co/F0xo92WRXl pic.twitter.com/yuVQzOiB3T — Andy Ngô (@MrAndyNgo) April 8, 2021

Albion College told Breitbart News that “the individual responsible for the racist graffiti in Mitchell Towers is a student of color.”

“The student was immediately removed from campus and placed on temporary suspension while we conduct a full investigation as part of our student judicial process,” the college continued.

“All evidence has been turned over to law enforcement in cooperation with the ongoing criminal investigation,” Albion added. “We do not have any additional information to provide at this time as the student judicial process and criminal investigation proceed.”

In response to the graffiti, more than 450 Albion students and staffers had marched across campus on Monday to boycott and protest the school over the injustices they said are happening at the college, according to a report by WWMT-TV.

Chief Scott Kipp said that once the investigation into the student responsible for the graffiti is complete, the information will be submitted to the Calhoun County Prosecutor’s Office for any charges related to the incident, according to MLive.

Meanwhile, Albion College took to Twitter on Tuesday to inform the public that the student responsible for the racist and anti-Semitic graffiti had been identified and removed from campus.

While Albion did not in its tweets acknowledge the race of the student who admitted to creating the graffiti, the school did go on to insist in a follow-up tweet that change is still necessary.

“We know the acts of racism that have occurred this week are not about one particular person or one particular incident,” Albion said. “We know that there is a significant history of racial pain and trauma on campus and we are taking action to repair our community.”

“We will change and heal together as a community, because we are committed to doing the work,” the college added in a follow-up tweet.

15,"Pete Buttigieg: Americans Are Using the ‘Wrong’ Transportation, Or None at All","Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg told reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon that Americans were using the “wrong” forms of transportation — a problem he said President Joe Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan would fix.

Buttigieg also claimed that some Americans have no access to transportation at all. He added that Americans would once again be “challenged” to expand their ideas about infrastructure, which he said went far beyond roads and bridges.

He said:

Americans are spending too much of their money on transportation in the wrong ways, or don’t have access to it at all. And the American people are making it clear to all of us, regardless of party, that they want us to get it done, and they are not asking us to tinker around the edges. We have risen to this challenge before as a country. In fact, building bold infrastructure has always been central to America’s story. We built the Erie Canal, we connected east to west through the Transcontinental Railroad, and we developed the interstate highway system. And each of those was audacious, was transformative, and partly because it challenged the American people to expand our concept of infrastructure. But in doing so, these projects transformed our nation for the better.

Buttigieg did not explain what the “wrong ways” of transportation were. He reassured workers that the infrastructure of the future would still need “workers who are good with steel,” and that the new jobs it would create would not be too “futuristic.”

16,"WaPo: ‘GOP Can’t Be Saved,’ Center-Right Must Be ‘Biden Republicans'","A recent Washington Post article written by Post columnist and prominent “Never Trumper” Max Boot attacks the GOP for having “shifted to kooks” and become a “cult of personality” and a bastion of “irrationality,” “conspiracy mongering,” and “racism,” while calling for those on “center-right” GOP voters to join in support of President Biden.

The Wednesday article, titled “The GOP can’t be saved. Center-right voters need to become Biden Republicans,” begins with a quote from Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), one of ten House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Donald Trump earlier this year, stating that Trump is a “Republican usurper” and he would not let Trump “take the party” and he’d “fight like hell” to ensure so.

Despite admiring Kinzinger’s “fighting spirit,” which Boot claims he once shared, the Post columnist recalls that the day following the 2016 election, he “re-registered as an independent after a lifetime as a Republican,” a decision he writes that he never regretted because the GOP “has become even more of a horror show than I anticipated.”

Quoting former House speaker John Boehner (R-OH), Boot claims “the ‘crazies’ have taken over” the Republican party, as he laments the lack of “John McCain-style Republicans,” of which Kinzinger is described as one.

“The party’s center of gravity has shifted to kooks” like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and “low-rent hucksters” such as Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Boot writes.

Boot continues by accusing Republicans of apathy toward supposed Trump administration wrongdoings.

“Most Republicans don’t care that Trump locked up children, cozied up to white supremacists, tear-gassed peaceful protesters, benefited from Russian help in both of his campaigns, egregiously mishandled the pandemic, incited a violent attack on the Capitol and even faced fraud complaints from his own donors,” he writes.

Citing polls that have found overwhelming Republican support for Trump, Boot attacks the GOP as an irredeemable “cult of personality” fraught with deplorable values.

“This is a portrait of a party that can’t be saved — at least in the foreseeable future,” he writes. “The GOP remains a cult of personality for the worst president in U.S. history. It has become a bastion of irrationality, conspiracy mongering, racism, nativism and anti-scientific prejudices.”

Boot then suggests that a “sane, center-right voter” can either support an “increasingly extremist and obstructionist Republican Party” or a Democratic Party “working to solve our most pressing problems.”

Claiming they “have no standing left” to oppose Biden, Boot asserts that Republicans have “lost all credibility on free trade” after having “supported Trump’s trade wars” and neo-isolationist foreign policy.

“What do they have left?” he asks.

Boot concludes by accusing Republicans of “increasingly catering to the far right with shrill, divisive rhetoric and antidemocratic actions such as bills to restrict voting,” and advocating that those on the center-right “become Biden Republicans.”

In January, Boot called on heavyweight telecommunications corporations to shut down conservative cable news outlets including Fox News, One America News, and Newsmax TV, comparing the need to do so with that of shutting down foreign terrorist influencers.

“There is a whole infrastructure of incitement that will remain intact even after Trump leaves office,” Boot wrote. “Just as we do with foreign terrorist groups, so with domestic terrorists: We need to shut down the influencers who radicalize people and set them on the path toward violence and sedition.”

17,Greg Abbott Demands Kamala Harris Close Border Facility Housing Minors,"Gov. Greg Abbott (R-TX) wrote a letter Friday to Vice President Kamala Harris requesting the administration terminate the federal border facility in Texas, which houses unaccompanied foreign minors.

“Now that President Biden has named you Border Czar in charge of the administration’s response, I want to express to you the threats and challenges caused by this administration’s open border policies,” the letter reads. “In your role as Border Czar, you have a duty to these children and the American people to act immediately. I implore you to act immediately to protect these children, secure the border, and end this crisis.”

“The State of Texas previously warned about overcrowded conditions at these facilities, and now those conditions have led to allegations of child abuse and neglect,” he added.

“Our repeated warnings and questions have gone ignored by President Biden, yourself, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas,” continued Abbott.

Your “policies embolden and enrich cartels, smugglers, and human traffickers who continue to ramp up their criminal operations. Given your new role as the administration’s Border Czar, I urge you to visit the border to see the crisis for yourself,” the governor said.

The letter also requested answers from the Vice President to a list of questions:

Who is assisting these children as they travel through Mexico and cross the U.S. border?

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas has acknowledged that many of these children have been abused or harmed during their journeys. What is the administration doing to eliminate that harm?

Were these children forced to carry contraband into the United States?

Were these children or their families assisted, coerced, and threatened by cartel members or human traffickers?

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has vaguely suggested that these children are screened by appropriately trained personnel to identify potential victims of abuse, assault, and trafficking, but has provided no further information. What screening is being done? When is that screening taking place and by whom? Are these children being provided a thorough medical screening that may separately identify abuse and assault?

How many victims of physical abuse, sexual assault, or trafficking has the administration identified?

Is the federal government using DNA tests to confirm familial relations? How else is the administration ensuring that these children are being released to safe, trustworthy adults?

What specific measures can the administration point to that confirm that these children are not released to human traffickers in the United States?

What action is your administration taking to prosecute those who traffic unaccompanied minors?

The letter follows visits by Republican members of the House and Senate, who toured the border and Texas facilities in which Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said, “if you had any facility that takes care of kids that was even a fraction of what the Biden administration has set up, you’d be shut down.”

“The public health authorities would go after you. You would be fined. You might even be prosecuted. These cages that the kids were in, they weren’t six feet apart,” Cruz doubled down.",1
19,Republicans Call for Review of Benefits for Illegals in New York,"Reps. Jason Smith (R-MO) and James Comer (R-KY) called Friday for an investigation over concerns the state of New York may be funneling federal tax dollars to benefit illegal aliens.

Cuomo, along with New York state Democrats, negotiated a $2.1 billion fund that would allow 187,000 illegal aliens and 87,00 felons to potentially receive taxpayer-funded unemployment benefits that mirror state and federal benefits. The fund came as the result of the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion coronavirus package, the American Rescue Plan.

Comer, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, and Jason Smith, the ranking member of the House Budget Committee, noted that the payments to illegal immigrants and the funding New York received through the coronavirus package raise concerning questions. They wrote:

The $2.1 billion price tag of this fund is quite peculiar. The $1.9 trillion spending plan enacted last month allocated monetary relief to states using a new biased formula that resulted in New York, and other states run by Democrat officials, receiving disproportionately more aid than in previous coronavirus relief bills…Coincidentally, the amount of additional federal dollars New York appears to be receiving because of the change in the funding distribution formula is exactly the same as this new fund for illegal immigrants – $2.1 billion.

Comer and Smith also noted that the $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill made it more difficult for states to provide tax relief to their citizens than it allowed for federal tax dollars to illegal aliens. They wrote:",1
21,Burgess Owens: Democrats Shutting Their Eyes to Issue of Unaccompanied Migrant Children,"McALLEN, Texas — Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT) finds the Democrat Party is failing to acknowledge the issue of unaccompanied alien children (UACs) crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, he told Breitbart News in an interview Wednesday during his two-day trip to Texas.

Owens, a newly elected congressman and member of the House Judiciary Committee, visited McAllen with a congressional delegation of several other Judiciary Committee members to tour border facilities and meet with officials within the Rio Grande Valley.

During both the interview and a roundtable with his colleagues and Texas officials just prior to the interview, Owens became tearful as he spoke about a seven-year-old he encountered at a federal facility in Donna that temporarily holds mainly UACs. While a UAC is defined as anyone under 18 years old who has crossed the border illegally without a parent or guardian and many of the UACs are teenagers, Owens was particularly moved after he observed a group of UACs who were girls ages three to seven.

Owens said the children were “sitting there, looking up, sitting on the floor.” He continued, “And I recognize, I think about my grandkids the same ages. They have no idea what the next steps are. They don’t know where their moms and dads are,” adding, as he became choked up, “I think about this young girl, seven years old, slightly autistic, and she could not communicate, but for the 15 or 20 minutes we were there talking with everyone else, she just had tears in her eyes the entire time.”

Photos were prohibited while on the federal facility tour, and, furthermore, media were not allowed to accompany the delegation during it. Aside from a “single event” with select outlets last week, media are currently not allowed access to the facility at all, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official confirmed to congressional staff. The Associated Press, which was granted access for that one exception that the federal government had made, released images and videos of the facility, displaying what it described as a “severely overcrowded tent structure.”

Owens suggested Democrats are demonstrating a lack of concern for the UACs, whom Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley encounter after they are brought into the U.S. by way of smugglers on boats. “We have a party right now that’s all about power,” Owens said. “The more they shut their eyes to this, the more it opens up Americans’ eyes to just where this party’s going and what they’re doing right now. … We cannot have these kids being used the way they’re being used.”

Judiciary Committee ranking member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), who led the delegation on the trip, said during a press conference Wednesday that Judiciary Committee Democrats were invited on the trip and declined the invitation. Breitbart News reached out to committee chair Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) to inquire about the reason for this and did not receive an immediate response.

Owens said, “We have a party right now that really doesn’t want to talk at this particular point. I think the closer we get to 2022, those moderates — quote ‘moderates’ — who truly want to have seats, they’re going to start talking with us because we need to get some solutions done.”

23,Carville: 'English Faculty at Amherst Has too Much Power' w,"Appearing Thursday on Conversations with Bill Kristol, veteran Democrat strategist James Carville weighed in on the Democrat Party’s embrace of identity politics and wokeism, quipping: “the English faculty at Amherst has too much power in this party.”

A transcript is as follows:

BILL KRISTOL: You mentioned defund the police, you mentioned identity politics, cancel culture, whatever you want to call these things, but how worried are you about that complex of issues? Some of the attacks may be unfair, some may be fair, but the Democrats, parts of the Democratic party coalition, giving enough oxygen to that stuff that allows Republicans to just scream and yell about it for two years or four years and really have an effect. You think it did have an effect 2020, certainly down ballot, right? The police stuff?

JAMES CARVILLE: It did. It is the thing that I’m most worried about. And because, first of all, who they are. I don’t know of anybody, and I talked to, I live in New Orleans, okay? It’s no secret. I don’t know of a single person that thinks of themselves as a “person of color.” I really don’t. I had Ruben Gallego, who’s a Democratic congressman from Arizona, and we did much better in Arizona than we did in Texas or Florida, and he said, “I’ve never heard anybody use the word LatinX.” And that’s just not the way people talk.

25,Pilot Flies Family Booted Off Flight over Son's Mask to Austin,"A family, removed from a flight to Austin, Texas, because their young son would not wear a mask, eventually made it to their destination thanks to a local pilot.

“Erik Harvey, his wife Michelle, and their two-and-a-half-year-old son Jackson were all set to fly from Denver to Austin through Southwest Airlines on April 1st,” Fox 13 reported.

The family was aware of the federal mask mandate for passengers over age two and knew they had to get Jackson used to wearing his mask before leaving.

“I practiced with him at least two or three times at the house and every time he threw it off, but I figured that [Southwest] would work with us on the plane because he’s two,” Michelle recalled.

When they boarded the plane, her son was wearing his mask but when they sat down, he removed it.",1
27,"Blue State Blues: Don’t Worry, Nothing Joe Biden Does Will Work","The late, great Rush Limbaugh developed what he called the “Limbaugh Theorem” to explain President Barack Obama’s administration.

Simply put, nothing that went wrong was Obama’s fault; he was in power, but not responsible for anything. The media were so enamored of Obama that they allowed him to pretend he was a spectator to his own presidency.

Today, President Joe Biden really is a spectator to his own presidency, despite laughable claims that he makes every decision.

Regardless, after more than 80 days in office, Biden has made clear what his administration is about. He is no healer; he doesn’t care about unity; he has broken every promise to bring Americans together.

Biden is satisfied with the fulfillment of a lifelong ambition to be president, with all the rewards it provides him — and the protection it provides his corrupt family. America is being run by the Biden staff, who are exploiting a moment of crisis to carry out their utopian left-wing visions.

Much of what they do is disturbing; much of it is unconstitutional. But almost none of it will work.

Like Obama, who was impervious to the lessons of history, and the failure of socialism everywhere it has been tried, Biden is concentrating power in the federal government for the sake of doing so. He is not thinking about what will produce the best outcomes. Rather, he is thinking about the opportunity to be the next Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which means doing big things because he can.

So here is my own theorem for the Biden administration — really, a hypothesis about the next four years (including any part of Biden’s term that would be run by Kamala Harris when she takes over for the ailing president).

Almost nothing that Biden does will work, because socialism at home and appeasement abroad have never worked. Those things that work under Biden will be the things that were already working, thanks to President Donald Trump, or things people would have done anyway.

Take the coronavirus vaccine program. By any measure, it is a stunning success. Not only did the U.S. develop vaccines in record time, but some 20% of the population is already vaccinated, far ahead of Europe and most of the rest of the world.

Biden likes to pretend he “turned around” a failing distribution program, but the fact is that Trump’s program was already vaccinating nearly a million people per day when he left office; the graph of vaccinations since December is a straight line.

Biden’s gun control effort, however, is already a dead letter. On Thursday, the president emphasized the importance of expanded background checks in preventing gun violence. Meanwhile, his son, Hunter Biden, continued promoting a memoir in which he admits to extensive drug use — a habit he allegedly lied about on forms during a background check when he purchased his own firearm in 2018. If Hunter Biden is not prosecuted — and he won’t be — the new rules mean nothing.

On the border, Biden may be forced to return to Trump’s supposedly “inhumane” policies, such as building the wall, because his own policies have encouraged a massive surge of migrants to the border, including record-breaking numbers of children. That has created a political crisis for the new administration, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas reportedly told staff that construction of the hated “wall” might have to be resumed to fill troublesome “gaps.”

Other things continue to work despite Biden’s best efforts to stop them from working. The economy is roaring back, even though Biden tried to frighten Americans with talk of a “dark winter” and tried to discourage Republican-run states from reopening their economies.

Thanks to Texas, Florida, and other conservative-led states, Americans are returning to work — and infection numbers in those states continue to drop, while some restrictive “blue” states are suffering virus surges.

The Middle East peace process also marches forward, with Sudan announcing this week that it is ending its boycott of Israel. It did so even though the Biden administration has done everything it can to punish the Arab countries that made peace with Israel under Trump, and making every effort to appease Iran.

Biden is also trying to send hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinians, in violation of U.S. law. Never mind: the Arab states are making peace because it is in their interest to do so.

Meanwhile, Biden’s infrastructure plan will fail — for the same reason that his stimulus failed more than a decade ago, when then-Vice President Biden funded lemons like Solyndra and Fisker. The country is too big, and the economy too complex, for the federal government to redesign national infrastructure on a trillion-dollar scale.

The Biden Theorem predicts that Biden will fail. The only question is how much damage he and his party will do to our country on the way.

Ask Atlanta about that.

29,China: Claiming Coronavirus Originated Here Is a ‘Conspiracy Theory’,"China’s Global Times, a newspaper published by the government, dismissed Thursday the widely accepted consensus that the Chinese coronavirus originated in Hubei province, China, as a “conspiracy theory” that did not deserve free speech safeguards.

The first cases of Chinese coronavirus infections in human beings were documented in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, in late 2019. No evidence exists suggesting that any cases of human infection were documented before November 17, 2019, the date leaked Chinese government documents reportedly listed as that in which doctors confirmed the first Wuhan case.

Beijing has publicly only accepted that cases existed within its borders as of December of that year, arguing that evidence of cases in places like Italy, which has a high concentration of Chinese immigrants, before December suggest a foreign origin for the novel coronavirus. The Chinese Communist Party has also increasingly pressured the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to launch an investigation into the United States as the origin nation of the virus, despite no evidence suggesting that the first infections occurred there.

The Global Times described believing China is the home nation of the Chinese coronavirus as a “conspiracy theory” in an article condemning criticism of the Communist Party — particularly its poor handling of the pandemic and its ongoing genocide campaign against the Uyghur people of western Xinjiang — in Australia. The Times dismissed any concerns about human rights under the Han supremacist regime as inherently discriminatory and sensationalist.

“Is it racism to criticize China, or freedom of speech? Rising racial discrimination against Asians has sparked a debate on the issue in Australia,” the Times noted. “However, whether people have the freedom to criticize China or not is not a problem. The issue is, in Australia, there are smears and rumors against China, and Canberra has been an active part of them.”

Free speech concerns aside, it alleged, “there is still a clear boundary between information and disinformation.”

“A disinformation campaign launched by some Western media and elites, including conspiracy theory that COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] originated in China and China’s governance in Xinjiang is ‘genocide,’ are groundless rumors,” the article insisted. To defend its first point, the Global Times cited the W.H.O. published in March on the results of an agency visit to Wuhan and investigation into the origin of the virus.

The report concluded the likeliest path to human infection was that an infected animal spread the virus to a second animal that then came into contact with humans. It stated that the least likely hypothesis investigated was an accidental leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a laboratory known to have been studying coronaviruses at the time of the outbreak. The report also speculated there was a non-zero, though not major, chance that the virus entered Wuhan through animal meat shipped from elsewhere.

The W.H.O. investigation occurred in early 2021, a year after Chinese officials admitted to destroying early samples of the virus, making studies into its evolution impossible. At the press conference to announce the publication of the report, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus condemned China for keeping important data from the investigative team and urged further investigation into the lab leak theory.

“The team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident,” Tedros said. “However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions.”

“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” he offered.

While the Global Times initially reacted to Tedros’ remarks by accusing him of “appeasing Washington,” on Thursday it appeared to interpret the aftermath of the W.H.O. investigation into Wuhan as being a definitive conclusion that the virus did not originate in China. The text of the W.H.O. report does not in any way dismiss the entirety of the Chinese nation as a potential origin source for the virus, or even Wuhan city.

“The World Health Organization-China investigation has suggested broader probe on virus origins in more countries after their probe in China, yet Australia joined the US and 13 other countries to question the W.H.O. report,” the Global Times claimed, referring to calls from the latter nations for more scientific research.

W.H.O. experts have indeed not fully dismissed the possibility that the Chinese coronavirus originated elsewhere. The experts have not, however, fully discarded the possibility that the virus originated where the first infections occurred. Notably, biologist Hung Nguyen-Viet, a member of the W.H.O. Wuhan team, suggested that the virus may have come from farms in southern China, which would explain the absence of any cases of animals carrying the virus in the wild in Hubei.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has spent much of the past year attempting to make the case that America is the true source of the virus. Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has repeatedly accused the U.S. Army of causing the pandemic, without providing any evidence. Colleague Hua Chunying has suggested that American doctors misdiagnosed cases of coronavirus as lung injuries from the use of e-cigarettes or vapes — often the product of using unregulated products manufactured in China. Hua has never explained how that could be possible given that injuries, unlike coronavirus infections, are not contagious, and no evidence suggests vaping lung injuries are an exception to that rule.

The Global Times ultimately lamented that free speech concerns over censorship of criticism of the Communist Party in Australia were “very hypocritical and ridiculous.”",1
31,CDC Deems Racism a ‘Serious’ Public Health Threat,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) deemed racism a “serious” public health threat, according to an entry published on the agency’s website.

In an entry titled “Racism is a Serious Threat to the Public’s Health,” the agency asserts racism is intricately intertwined with public health matters:

A growing body of research shows that centuries of racism in this country has had a profound and negative impact on communities of color. The impact is pervasive and deeply embedded in our society—affecting where one lives, learns, works, worships and plays and creating inequities in access to a range of social and economic benefits—such as housing, education, wealth, and employment. These conditions—often referred to as social determinants of health—are key drivers of health inequities within communities of color, placing those within these populations at greater risk for poor health outcomes.

The CDC cites data suggesting racial and ethnic minority groups experience higher rates of health conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease “when compared to their White counterparts.”

“Additionally, the life expectancy of non-Hispanic/Black Americans is four years lower than that of White Americans,” the entry reads.

“The COVID-19 pandemic, and its disproportionate impact among racial and ethnic minority populations is another stark example of these enduring health disparities,” the agency continues, also identifying racism as depriving the U.S. and scientific and medical community “of the full breadth of talent, expertise, and perspectives needed to best address racial and ethnic health disparities.”

As a result, the U.S. “must confront the systems and policies that have resulted in the generational injustice that has given rise to racial and ethnic health inequities,” the agency adds, although it did not list specific systems and policies it believes need the U.S. must face head-on.

“What we know is this: racism is a serious public health threat that directly affects the well-being of millions of Americans,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement posted in a section titled “Director’s Commentary”:

As a result, it affects the health of our entire nation. Racism is not just the discrimination against one group based on the color of their skin or their race or ethnicity, but the structural barriers that impact racial and ethnic groups differently to influence where a person lives, where they work, where their children play, and where they gather in community.

The American Medical Association (AMA) praised the CDC for addressing the topic of racism.

AMA President Susan Bailey said in a statement:

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disproportionately plague Black and Brown communities, it’s clear that collective action from all stakeholders is needed to dismantle systemic racism and confront, embed, and advance equity across our health care system.

All the while, Democrats have continued to deem other issues, seemingly unrelated to public health, as matters of public health.

During Thursday’s Rose Garden address on executive actions on firearms, for example, President Biden referred to the “gun crisis” as a “public health crisis.”

“We got a long way to go. It always seems like we always have a long way to go. But I also — today, we’re taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis,” Biden said, later adding that his steps will lead to the creation of safer and healthier communities.",1
33,Russia Hints that Coronavirus Is U.S. Bioweapon,"The secretary of Russia’s Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, said in an interview Thursday that American “military biology research” may account for the eruption of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan, central China.

Patrushev accused the United States of experimenting with biological weapons in regions near the borders of China and Russia in response to the Russian newspaper Kommersant asking for a comment regarding the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) failing to identify an animal source of the Chinese coronavirus. The W.H.O. sent a team to Wuhan at the beginning of 2021 — over a year after the initial epidemic began there, and nearly a year after Chinese officials admitted to destroying key evidence on the origin of the virus — to collect evidence seeking an answer to how the pandemic began. The report published after the W.H.O. experts’ visit to China revealed that, after testing tens of thousands of animals in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, they could not find a single animal carrying the Chinese coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2.

Patrushev responded to the lack of evidence that the virus is prevalent in nature in the area where the pandemic began with “the fact” that American biological laboratories exist in Asia, according to a translation of the Kommersant interview Russia’s Foreign Ministry published on Facebook.

“Please note the fact that the number of U.S.-controlled biological laboratories is growing by leaps and bounds around the world. Strangely, they are built near Russian and Chinese borders,” Patrushev said. “They assure us that these are research centres where the Americans help local researchers develop new medications to combat dangerous diseases. Truth be told, the authorities of the countries where these sites are located have no idea what is happening behind their walls.”

“Certainly, we, and our Chinese partners, have questions in this regard,” he continued. “We are being told that peaceful sanitary and epidemiological stations are operating near our borders, but for some reason they seem more reminiscent of Fort Detrick in Maryland where the Americans have been working on military biology research for decades. Importantly, outbreaks of diseases that are not typical of these regions are being recorded in neighbouring areas.”

Patrushev did not offer any examples of the alleged suspicious “outbreaks of diseases” his government had documented.

Fort Detrick, Maryland, houses a U.S. Army laboratory temporarily shut down in November 2019 over a “failure of Fort Detrick’s steam sterilization plant,” according to military officials. It resumed operations in March 2020. The Chinese Communist Party has, for over a year, accused the Fort Detrick site of unleashing the Chinese coronavirus on the world, falsely claiming that cases of lung injuries tied to the use of e-cigarettes, or vapes, in 2019 were secret Chinese coronavirus cases. No evidence suggests any relationship between the lung injuries and Chinese coronavirus and lung injuries are, unlike the Chinese coronavirus, not contagious, meaning no health workers were diagnosed with these injuries after treating patients despite not using infectious disease protocol.

Kommersant asked Patrushev to clarify on the alleged Asian biological research sites: “Are you saying that the Americans are developing biological warfare agents there?”

“We have good reasons to believe that this is exactly the case,” Patrushev answered. The senior Russian official did not identify any site that he considered to be a potential origin source for the Chinese coronavirus or explain how biological weapons testing near the Chinese border would result in a disease outbreak in the heart of the country, nearly a thousand miles from the closest border, without infecting anyone along the way.

Patrushev said Russia would “work with our partners … in the post-Soviet space” to address the issue, adding ominously that “the Americans have issues with chemical weapons, as well.”

Zhao Lijian, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman who first floated the conspiracy theory that the Chinese coronavirus pandemic was the product of U.S. Army work, embraced Patrushev’s remarks during his regular press briefing on Thursday. Zhao, unlike Patrushev, identified Ukraine as a potential location for suspect U.S. Army research facilities.

“I noticed that Russia recently expressed concern once again over the bio-military activities by the U.S. on its own territory including at Fort Detrick and in other countries like Ukraine. This concern is actually shared by many other countries,” Zhao said. “As China has said repeatedly, relevant US activities are not transparent, safe or justified.”

“We may take Ukraine for example, which was mentioned by the Russian side. According to openly available reports, the US has set up 16 bio-labs in Ukraine alone,” Zhao claimed. “Why does it need to build so many labs all over the world? What activities has the US military been conducting in these labs and the base at Fort Detrick?”

The W.H.O. report, written in conjunction with Chinese-approved scientists and heavily supervised by authorities with ties to Beijing, addressed the possibility of the virus leaking from a research laboratory but dismissed it as highly unlikely. Wuhan, where the pandemic began, is home to one of the most advanced virology centers in the world, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was known to be studying coronaviruses at the time of the outbreak. The W.H.O. explicitly rejected the idea of a laboratory accident and stated it did not address the potential of a deliberate pathogen release.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O., dismissed the agency’s own research on the laboratory leak theory in a press conference intended to debut the report.

“The team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident,” Tedros told reporters. “However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions.”

Beijing, previously highly supportive of Tedros, accused him of trying to “appease Washington” following the remarks.",1
35,Rep. Mike Waltz: West Point Mandates Seminar on Critical Race Theory,"West Point, the preeminent institution for training future Army leaders, is requiring cadets to attend a seminar on critical race theory, according to Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), a Green Beret colonel in the Army National Guard.

“Information has recently come to my attention from unsettled soldiers, cadets, and families that raises serious concerns about the U.S. Army’s introduction of elements of critical race theory into cadet instruction,” Waltz said in a letter on Thursday to Lt. Gen. Darryl A. Williams, superintendent of West Point.

Waltz said he was told West Point cadets were required to attend at least one seminar on “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and obtained slides from one of the seminars that were titled “White Power at West Point” and “Racist Dog Whistles at West Point.” He said another slide depicted a lecture by Dr. Carol Anderson of Emory University with the title “Understanding Whiteness and White Rage.”

“Additionally, I understand that on September 24, 2020 the entire corps of cadets was required to report to Michie Stadium for your address as Superintendent and to hear from a cadet panel.” He continued, “In this session, an active duty female colonel described to the Corps how she become [sic] ‘woke’ to her white privilege, and felt guilty for the advantages of her race.”

Waltz’s letter added:

At this same assembly, white police officers were described as murderers with no context or court documents provided to corroborate the anecdotes of police brutality. While this session may have been well intended to invoke awareness and understanding, I am hearing forcefully that this session and others like it are instead breading insult and resentment.

Waltz said these critical race theory teachings “pit cadets against one another through divisive indoctrination under the pressure of ‘wokeism.'”

“In a combat environment, where every soldier must equally share the burden of danger, I cannot think of a notion more destructive to unit cohesion and morale,” he added, requesting all materials from the seminars, presentations, assemblies, and related curricula on these teachings.

Read the letter here.

Waltz also appeared on Fox News’s Tucker Carlson Tonight on Thursday to explain why critical race theory hurts combat effectiveness. He said:

As a Green Beret, I can’t imagine being in a situation in combat, and I’m ordering a soldier to charge the machine gun, and he now has a seed planted in the back of his mind: Am I sending him because he’s African American? Should I feel guilty because of white privilege? That is absolutely destructive to morale, to unity, to everything that I know from a military…that, by the way, integrated way before the rest of the country in 1948. Look, Tucker, we’ll deal with all these things as a society, but the military has to stay a very special place, focused on having the best of the best to defeat the nation’s enemies and China, Russia and Iran and others if we have to:

37,Special Climate Envoy Kerry: Action Now to Avoid Global ‘Suicide Pact’,"President Joe Biden’s special enjoy for climate change John Kerry said in an interview Thursday during his recent trip to India that immediate action is required to stem the effects of climate change and avoid a “mutual suicide pact across the planet.”

Kerry — whose flight carbon footprint has not been made public — is traveling thousands of miles to speak with leaders in India, Bangladesh, and the United Arab Emirates about fighting so-called manmade climate change.

The Washington Post reported on Kerry’s remarks as he travels abroad during the global coronavirus pandemic “to make a profound push to combat climate change in the months and years ahead, and it needs all the partners it can get.”

The Post reported that Kerry delivered his message with “humility for four years that have been wasted,” referring to former President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord to avoid harming the U.S. economy, energy independence, and American jobs. Biden reversed Trump’s America First policy as quickly as he could.

The Post report said:

Kerry said that as the dangers posed by climate change become more clear, the urgency of the problem means that countries must work together to confront it, or else face a “mutual suicide pact across the planet.” The problem remains solvable, but it “depends entirely on the political will,” and the United States under Biden plans to lead by example, he said. Exactly what that example might look like will take shape later this month, when Biden convenes dozens of world leaders for a virtual Earth Day summit. He is expected to introduce a new, more ambitious plan to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions between now and 2030 — probably in the neighborhood of 50 percent compared to 2005 levels. Whether that goal becomes a reality will depend at least in part on what initiatives Congress is willing to fund and what policies future administrations pursue. Still, the moment is aimed at reestablishing American leadership in the fight to limit the Earth’s warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) compared with preindustrial levels — a threshold beyond which scientists predict irreversible environmental damage.

The Post praised the Biden Administration for its effort to “compel other large-emitting countries to increase their efforts and cement enhanced national pledges.”

Kerry said he wants to accomplish these goals ahead of the United Nations’ climate event in Scotland in the fall.

The Post noted that India is reporting record numbers of coronavirus cases but Kerry spent three days there to advance Biden’s climate change agenda.

And the newspaper, which almost daily criticized Trump in its reporting, defended the need for Kerry to meet leaders in person rather than virtually — which Americans have been forced to do for more than a year.

Kerry said in the interview it creates “greater ease in the give and take,” and you can “whisper in their ear” something “you don’t want other people necessarily to hear.”

Kerry claimed India doesn’t use coal as an energy source because it likes it and would “leap” at the chance to use so-called alternative energy if they have the financing.

But according to National Geographic progress is slow:

The report’s analysis of the 184 pledges for 2030 found that almost 75 percent were insufficient. In fact, the world’s first and fourth biggest emitters, China and India, will have higher emissions in 2030. The U.S. is the second largest and its pledge is too low. It’s also in doubt, given the Trump Administration’s withdrawal from the accord. Russia, the fifth largest emitter, hasn’t even bothered to make a pledge.

“Kerry met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi this week and praised his determination to move India in the right direction,” the Post reported.

“He’s deeply invested in this,” Kerry said in the interview.

39,Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs Introduces ‘No Vaccine Passports’ Act,"Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) introduced the ‘No Vaccine Passports’ Act, which would prevent all federal agencies from issuing any type of standardized documentation on a citizen’s coronavirus vaccination status.

Biggs’ bill would mandate no federal agencies issue of any type of “standardized documentation that could be used to certify a U.S. citizen’s COVID-19 status to a third party, such as a restaurant or an airline.” The bill would also prohibit using proof of coronavirus vaccine to gain access to federal or congressional properties and services.

Biggs said he is “profoundly disturbed” the Biden administration would consider imposing any type of vaccine passports on Americans.

“My private healthcare decisions—and yours—are nobody else’s business. Vaccine passports will not help our nation recover from COVID-19; instead, they will simply impose more Big Brother surveillance on our society,” he said in a statement.

The Republican said he applauds Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for being one of the early leaders at the state level that has opposed the vaccine passports, adding, “my No Vaccine Passports Act builds on his efforts and will further protect Americans’ privacy rights and fundamental freedoms.”

Recently, an increasing number of Republican governors voiced their opposition to vaccine passports and are standing firmly against imposing a system on Americans.

As Biggs mentioned, DeSantis has been the most vocal of the governors and has led the opposition for any type of coronavirus vaccine passport. DeSantis has said the idea of vaccine passports is “terrible” and “unacceptable.”",1
41,Trump Remembers Prince Philip: 'Noble Soul and Proud Spirit',"Former President Donald Trump paid tribute to Prince Philip, the longest-serving consort of a reigning British monarch, who passed away at the age of 99 at Windsor Castle on Friday morning.

In a statement, Trump said:

The world mourns the passing of Prince Philip, a man who embodied the noble soul and proud spirit of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. Melania and I send our deepest and most profound condolences to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and to the entire Royal Family. We send our most heartfelt sympathies to the British people. This is an irreplaceable loss for Great Britain, and for all who hold dear our civilization.

Trump lauded Prince Philip as a leader who defined British “dignity and grace” and personified “the quiet reserve, stern fortitude, and unbending integrity” of the country:

For seven decades, Prince Philip brought the same sense of duty and purpose to his role as consort and husband to the Queen. He was admired by his fellow citizens, and respected by everyone around the world. His exceptional example of service, constancy, and patriotism will be his greatest legacy. Over the past few years, Melania and I were honored to have the opportunity to visit the United Kingdom. We saw firsthand how the Monarchy epitomizes and carries on the virtues of the British People—and no one did so more than Prince Philip. As we grieve his loss, we celebrate his memory and rededicate ourselves to the values to which he devoted his extraordinary life. He will be greatly missed.

The duke of Edinburgh died after spending weeks in London hospitals and undergoing an unspecified heart procedure March 4 for a pre-existing condition. He first entered King Edward VII‘s Hospital on Feb. 16.

“It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty the Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,” Buckingham Palace said in a statement.

“His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. The royal family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.”

The statement was shared on the social media accounts of royal family members and Buckingham Palace placed an announcement on its gates.

43,Delingpole: RIP Prince Philip – the Last Royal Climate Sceptic,"The late Duke of Edinburgh was no fool. One way he showed this was in his attitude to the climate change scare: unlike his idiot son Charles or his brainwashed grandsons William and Harry, he knew it to be a load of old nonsense.

Though convention dictates that Royals are supposed to be discreet on contentious political issues, there were occasions when Prince Philip simply couldn’t contain himself.

One such was the time ten years ago when the Duke was evidently infuriated by an encounter with a wind turbine operator. The man’s name was Esbjorn Wilmar, managing director of Infinergy, one of the companies blighting Britain’s seascape with offshore windturbines. Wilmar impertinently suggested that the Duke install wind turbines on his royal property. The Duke, as the Mail reported, gave him short shrift.

Mr Wilmar said he introduced himself to the 90-year-old Duke at a reception and suggested he put wind turbines on royal property. ‘He said that they were absolutely useless, completely reliant on subsidies and an absolute disgrace. I was surprised by his very frank views,’ he said. When Mr Wilmar tried to argue that onshore turbines are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy, the Duke apparently replied: ‘You don’t believe in fairy tales do you?’ Mr Wilmar added: ‘He said they would never work as they need back-up capacity.’ And the Duke apparently told him: ‘You stay away from my estate young man.’

The Duke’s muscular views inevitably brought him into conflict with his woke whelp the Prince of Wales who is, of course, a notorious climate alarmist and relentless green campaigner.

Usually, these disagreements took place behind the scenes. But occasionally they burst into the open, as when the Duke invited botanist David Bellamy — a former BBC presenter who bravely dared question the global warming narrative and had his TV career canceled as a result — to give a lecture at Buckingham Palace.

Prince Charles, who had warned in March 2009 that there were ‘less than 100 months to act’ to save the planet, made his displeasure known by issuing a coded statement of disapproval on the BBC’s excruciating green propaganda show Countryfile.

According to the Times (of London):

In Countryfile, BBC One’s weekly rural affairs show, Prince Charles did not directly address climate change but indicated his broad concern. “We need to think about what kind of world we’re handing on to our successors, particularly grandchildren,” he said. “If you think of it in those terms, it should make us reflect a little bit about the way we do things so we don’t ruin it for them.”

Gosh, which errant grandparent could Prince Charles possibly have had in mind?

Though Prince Philip was himself a conservationist, he was definitely not a greenie. Indeed he told the late Christopher Booker in a letter, written in response to his climate-sceptical book The Real Global Warming Disaster.

Booker wrote:

I was startled and delighted to have a long, thoughtful and sympathetic letter from [Prince Philip], who also wanted to correct a mistake in my book. I had said he was still a supporter of the World Wildlife Fund, which he co-founded in 1961. In fact, he said, he had withdrawn from the WWF after it switched from its original focus on saving endangered species to relentless campaigning against global warming.

The Duke’s enthusiasm was in marked contrast to that of his son Charles, as Booker reported:

45,Duke of Edinburgh: Russia Mourns 'Gt-Gt-Grandson' of Tsar Nicholas,"While the Duke of Edinburgh was best known as part of the British monarchy, he was born a Greek prince, part of a dense web of European royalty that existed before the great calamity of the 20th century.

The Russian Federation, the republic which replaced Communist Soviet Russia after its collapse in 1991, made clear reference to the monarchy wiped out by the communists in 1917-18 in its message of condolence to the British people on Friday. Identifying the Duke of Edinburgh as the “great-great-grandson of Russian Emperor Nicholas I”, the Russian Embassy in London noted: “[Philip] was admired and will be mourned by many Russians. May his soul rest in peace.”

While His Royal Highness became the Duke of Edinburgh when he married the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947, he was born to the then-reigning Greek royal family in 1921. When the Greek monarchy was deposed, he was smuggled out of the country, just 18 months old, in an orange crate onto a Royal Navy warship.

It is through his Greek royal family that the Duke was a descendant from the formerly ruling Russian Royal family, the Romanovs. Grand Duchess Olga Konstantinovna of Russia, one of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia’s granddaughters, had married Philip’s grandfather the Greek King Georgios in 1867.

This makes Philip’s children — including future British kings Charles and William — descendants of the Romanovs, as well. Prince Charles would be the first British king to be descended from a Romanov — the Duke of Edinburgh was the Queen’s consort rather than King — and would be the first British Royal descended from Queen Victoria of Britain through two separate bloodlines.

The Duke’s relatively close blood to the Romanovs — the ruling branch of whom were deposed by the Communists in Russia in 1917 and unceremoniously murdered in 1918 — was pivotal in a 2018 investigation into human remains thought to belong to the slain royals. Prince Philip donated his blood to scientists who used it to match DNA with bones found in an unmarked grave in Yekaterinburg, proving they were the mortal remains of the Romanovs.

The Duke made an overt reference to this history at the height of the Cold War. In 1967, he said: “I’d like to go to Russia very much – although the bastards murdered half my family.”

Prince Philip did, in fact, visit Russia in 1973 — the first Royal to visit the country since the Communists executed their royal family 55 years before. As the New York Times Moscow correspondent reported then, the Duke — “informally dressed in tweed” — piloted his own aircraft for six hours for the visit.",1
47,Rapper Big Boogie Arrested in Mississippi over Highway Shooting,"Memphis-based rapper Big Boogie was among 24 people arrested in Mississippi over a highway shooting incident that left one man hospitalized.

The shooting occurred on highway 55 just south of the Tennessee border, near Coldwater, Mississippi, at around one p.m. on Thursday, according to the Daily Mail.

Police officials corralled a caravan of automobiles and arrested 21 people on various charges, including gun, drug, and traffic violation charges. The “Murder 4 Me” rapper, whose real name is John Lotts, was one of 21 arrested on the roadway. Four cars were impounded, and three other people were arrested at another location.

A police report says that the man wounded was riding with a felon in his car and had a large amount of cash, a gun, and “felony amounts of narcotics” in his vehicle.

Most of the people in the caravan were reportedly part of the rapper’s “posse,” and were headed to a BlackSpringBreak event in Biloxi, Mississippi, where Big Boogie was set to perform.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics have said that no charges have officially been filed against any of those arrested.

Big Boogie was linked to another shooting last July when two people were fatally shot at his concert on Como, Mississippi. Two men were arrested and charged in the shooting.

One of the men, Sheldon Gibbs, had six warrants out for his arrest, two for first-degree murder, and four for aggravated assault.

49,Behar: America Is an ‘International Embarrassment’ on Guns — Dems Need to ‘Push Through’ Reform,"Joy Behar told her co-hosts Friday on ABC’s “The View” that America was an “international embarrassment” on guns.

Therefore, she said Democrats needed to “push through” gun control reforms.

Behar said, “There were ten mass shootings in just this week. Yesterday President Joe Biden said it’s time for real reforms but he also made it clear he’s not coming for your guns. Watch.”

In a video from his Thursday announcement on guns, President Biden said, “Nothing I’m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment. There are phony arguments suggesting these are Second Amendment rights at stake in what we are talking about. No amendment, no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. Gun violence in this country is an epidemic and it’s an international embarrassment.”

Behar said, “When he says it’s an international embarrassment, I watch a lot of foreign TV and they will have a joke in the show like somebody got shot and then the cop will say, ‘What are we in the United States?’ We are an international embarrassment, just like he says. If you ask me Democrats have to seize the day. You know they will never possibly have control of the House, the Senate and the White House again. So I say push through whatever is needed and hope Congress comes to their senses.”

She added, “I’ve never actually seen a real gun.”

51,Lil Nas X ‘Satan Shoes’ to Be Recalled as Nike Settles Lawsuit,"Nike announced on Thursday that it has settled its lawsuit against MSCHF, a company that made the “Satan Shoes” in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. The satanic sneakers are now being recalled. The settlement with MSCHF Product Studio Inc. resolves a trademark infringement lawsuit that Nike filed over the “Satan Shoes,” which involved modified Nike Air Max 97 sneakers, according to a Reuters report.

As part of the legal settlement with Nike, MSCHF has reportedly agreed to buy back the sneakers that have already been sold in order to remove them from circulation.

The satanic sneakers reportedly contained a drop of human blood and were limited to 666 pairs. The shoes also had “Luke 10:18” printed on them, in reference to a Biblical verse, which reads, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven,” and were priced at $1,018. The shoes quickly sold out, with the last of the 666 pairs being held back so that Lil Nas X could choose the recipient, reports Reuters.

Nike reacted by filing a lawsuit against the maker of Lil Nas X’s limited edition sneaker line, alleging that MSCHF violated copyright laws by customizing Nike Air Max 97 shoes without the company’s permission.

“Nike has not and does not approve or authorize MSCHF’s customized Satan Shoes,” Nike said at the time. “In fact, there is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF’s Satan Shoes based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorized or approved this product.”

David Bernstein, who represents MSCHF, said the artistic messages MSCHF hoped the Satan Shoes would convey were “dramatically amplified” by Nike’s lawsuit, reports Reuters.

“MSCHF intended to comment on the absurdity of the collaboration culture practiced by some brands, and about the perniciousness of intolerance,” Bernstein said. “Having achieved its artistic purpose, MSCHF is pleased to have resolved the lawsuit.”

Last month, Lil Nas X released a music video for his song, “Montero (Call Me By Your Name),” in which the rapper can be seen dancing on a stripper pole while descending to hell, where he subsequently gives Satan a lap dance.

53,George Clooney Emailing Advice to George Floyd’s Family Lawyer During Derek Chauvin Murder Trial,"Left-wing Hollywood star George Clooney has been in contact with Benjamin Crump, George Floyd’s family lawyer, during the murder trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Crump says Clooney has offered advice and reportedly suggested that Chauvin should volunteer to “get down on the floor in that courtroom, and let somebody come and put their knee on his neck.”

Crump, who has been known to take up controversial high-profile cases, appeared on The View this week and revealed his contact with the Midnight Sky director, producer, and star, George Clooney, who Crump said seeks to drive social change and is “very engaged in these social justice matters.”

Clooney, Crump said, emailed him specifically on how he should respond to the argument presented by Chauvin’s defense lawyers, who pointed to the possibility of a drug overdose leading to Floyd’s death rather than Chauvin’s knee on Floyd’s neck.

“He emails me from time to time. He talks about — he has children and he wants them to live in a better world. He said they keep talking about the assassination of character of George Floyd, there’s trace amounts of drugs and oh that’s the cause of death not what Derek Chauvin did,” Crump said before relaying what Clooney reportedly told him to say.

“He says, ‘Attorney Crump, you should tell them if Derek Chauvin feels so confident in that, he should volunteer during his case, to get down on the floor in that courtroom, and let somebody come and put their knee on his neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds and be able to see if he can survive,'” Crump said.

Watch below:

“And I believe in my heart, Joy Behar, that he will be held criminally liable and it will hopefully set a new precedent in America,” Crump added.

Clooney has continued to remain involved in pushing left-wing causes over the years, gushing over Biden last December — describing him as a “very smart, wise man”– and urging Americans to “put a fucking mask on.”

Following the January Capitol protest and riots, Clooney concluded the event sealed former President Trump and his family fate, relegating them “into the dustbin of history.”

“That name will now forever be associated with insurrection,” he added.",1
55,Hollywood Celebrities Bash Hollywood Studios over Prejudice and Discrimination Toward Disabled Talent,"More than 80 actors and entertainment industry professionals wrote an open letter flogging Hollywood over its alleged prejudice and discrimination toward disabled people.

The letter says that there’s an “urgent need to act on disability inclusion,” adding that the number of disabled characters on screen “continues to severely under-represent the actual US population living with disabilities,” according to a report by BBC News. “Due to years of misrepresentation in the media, social barriers, and chronic ableism, the deaf, hard of hearing, neurodiverse and disabled communities continue to be underrepresented and disrespected in the entertainment industry.”

The letter was signed by actors including Amy Poehler, Naomie Harris, and Jessica Barden.

The letter proposes that studios appoint permanent disability officers, which would “make fundamental changes to dated practices” by giving decision-makers “the confidence to include, talk about and portray disability,” ensuring inclusive hiring practices, and identifying opportunities for disabled talent.

In a document, titled “Hollywood Horror Stories,” which is accompanied by the letter, disabled talent anonymously detailed the discrimination they have faced.

The document includes stories about disabled talent being asked, “What happened to you?,” “Can you have sex?,” and “Can you really not see?,” as well as instances in which they say basic needs were not met.

“I was asked to audition where the audition room was up a flight of stairs with no elevator, the role specifically asked for someone who was disabled to play the role,” one actor said.

Writer Samantha Mannis, who was working for a renowned Hollywood studio, added that she was fired two weeks after a disability-related hospital stay.

Last year, Oscar winner Octavia Spencer demanded that Hollywood studios commit to casting disabled people as disabled characters, as able-bodied actors portraying disabled characters are now considered “offensive” under proposed some Hollywood rules.

Watch below:

Discrimination toward disabled people is not the only prejudice Hollywood has been accused of. The left-leaning industry also faces accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia.

Earlier this year, actress Rita Moreno said that racism in Hollywood is “still the same damn problem” it was when she was starting out seven decades ago.

Last year, Latin television and film creators demanded Hollywood “#EndLatinXclusion” in the entertainment industry, stating, “We are tired,” and “We refuse to be filtered through a White perspective.”

Actress Emma Thompson has also called out Hollywood’s casting sexism, stating that once a woman passes the age of 50, she becomes “invisible.”

Earlier this week, Titanic and Avatar star Kate Winslet says she knows “at least four” actors who are “hiding their sexuality” due to “homophobia” that exists in Hollywood.

Bergh said, “I’ve been a CEO now for about ten years. I can tell you that over that 10-year period of time, the role has changed dramatically. You know, the business roundtable, talk about stakeholder management and ensuring that we’re driving value for all stakeholders. I have a large employee base globally.

We’re committed to making change. This company has been around for 180 years. A big part of the reason I believe we’ve been around for 180 years is we’ve not been afraid to take a position on issues that are really, really important and not been afraid to stick our neck out on these tough issues.”

He continued, “When it comes to gun control, gun violence is ripping this country apart. It’s almost every single day you’re hearing about another incident. So this is important to us as a country.

59,Tennessee the 20th State to Abolish Concealed Permit Requirement,"On the same day that President Joe Biden was pushing more gun control at the federal level, Gov. Bill Lee (R) was signing legislation to do away with Tennessee’s concealed carry permit requirement.

Lee tweeted a photo of himself signing the legislation to do away with the permit requirement. The tweet included a shoutout to the NRA:

I signed constitutional carry today because it shouldn’t be hard for law-abiding Tennesseans to exercise their #2A rights. Thank you members of the General Assembly and @NRA for helping get this done. pic.twitter.com/xv2ZenOEZq — Gov. Bill Lee (@GovBillLee) April 8, 2021

The legislation signed by Lee takes effect July 1, 2021.

The Tennessean reports it “allows people 21 and older to carry handguns openly or concealed without a permit, along with members of the military ages 18 to 20.”

Tennessee will now become the 20th state to end its requirement for law-abiding citizens to get a permit from the government before exercising their right to bear arms.

The other 19 states are: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming.

61,PolitiFact: Joe Biden 'Exaggerated' and His Gun Claims Are 'Mostly False',"PolitiFact weighed the background check gun control claims President Joe Biden made Thursday and labeled them “mostly false.”

During the gun control push, Biden said, “Most people don’t know: If you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check. But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want and no background check.”

PolitiFact weighed Biden’s claim, noting Biden “exaggerated” and asserted his claim is “mostly false”:

NEW: In today's gun policy address, President Biden exaggerated about background checks at gun shows. Mostly False. https://t.co/fXAHU9pfCr pic.twitter.com/4ezABzIm9f — PolitiFact (@PolitiFact) April 8, 2021

Democrats have long used gun shows to justify the passage of more gun control. They often frame their appeals under the guise of fixing the so-called “gun show loophole,” intimating that criminals are using gun shows as a way to circumvent background checks and acquire guns.

However, on August 30, 2015, Breitbart News reported a University of Chicago Crime Lab study on criminals in the Cook County, Illinois, jail system. The study focused on “inmates who were facing gun charges or whose criminal background involved gun crimes.”

The Chicago-Tribune spoke with Crime Lab co-director Harold Pollack about the study and Pollack noted that “some of the pathways [regarding guns] people are concerned about don’t seem so dominant.” He noted very few inmates indicated using gun shows or the internet. Rather, they procured their guns in undetectable ways on the street.

63,FACT CHECK: Biden Falsely Claims Gun Makers Have 'Legal Immunity',"CLAIM: On Thursday, President Joe Biden claimed gun manufacturers have “legal immunity” and pressed for Congress to remove the legal protections.

VERDICT: False. The protections Biden criticizes allegedly flow from the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). But that Act shields gun makers from frivolous suits, not from all suits whatsoever.

Speaking from the Rose Garden on Thursday, Biden said: “We should… eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they receive from Congress.”

“Most people don’t realize, the only industry in America, a billion dollar industry, that can’t be sued… are gun manufacturers,” he added.

PLCAA is very narrow in scope. It shields gun makers from lawsuits in situations where a gun, criminally used, was legally made and legally sold.

In other words, Glock cannot be sued over a handgun that was used in crime if that handgun was legally made then distributed from the factory to a Federal Firearms License holder (FFL), then sold via a National Instant Criminal Background System (NICS) check to an individual at retail.

The text of PLCAA states:

Businesses in the United States that are engaged in interstate and foreign commerce through the lawful design, manufacture, marketing, distribution, importation, or sale to the public of firearms or ammunition products that have been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce are not, and should not, be liable for the harm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products or ammunition products that function as designed and intended.

However, the protections set forth PLCAA do not shield gun manufacturers from lawsuits over defective goods, criminal misconduct on the part of the gun maker, etc. In other words, the protections in PLCAA do not provide gun makers with “legal immunity.”

The CATO Institute opined:

PLCAA is a common‐​sense law. Product liability suits are usually focused on actual manufacturing defects. A good backyard grill effectively grills meat, but if it blows up due to a manufacturing defect, then a tort suit is warranted. A good gun shoots reliably and accurately and doesn’t blow up in your hands. While gun manufacturers should [be] and are liable for guns that malfunction, they shouldn’t be liable for making reliable and accurate guns that can be used for mayhem, of course, but can also be used for self‐​defense and sporting purposes.

In the lead up to the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton made gun company “immunity” claims which were similar those Biden is making now.

She said, “So far as I know, the gun industry and gun sellers are the only business in America that is totally free of liability for their behavior. Nobody else is given that immunity. And that just illustrates the extremism that has taken over this debate.”

NPR fact checked Clinton’s statement and found Clinton to be “wrong.”

They noted:

Lawmakers passed (PLCAA) in response to a spate of lawsuits that cities filed against the gun industry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Those lawsuits often claimed gun-makers or sellers were engaging in “negligent marketing” or creating a “public nuisance.” In 2000, for example, New York City joined 30 counties and cities in suing gun manufacturers, saying manufacturers should have been making their products safer and also better tracking where their products were sold. Manufacturers, one argument at the time went, should stop supplying stores that sell a lot of guns that end up being used in crimes. In response to these lawsuits, the NRA pushed for the law, which passed in 2005 with support from both Republicans and Democrats…The law, however, allows for specific cases in which dealers and manufacturers can be held responsible. So that makes Clinton’s statement technically incorrect.

Clinton’s claim that gun makers have “immunity” was wrong in 2015 and Joe Biden’s effort to suggest such “immunity” in 2021 is wrong as well.

65,Joe Biden: Second Amendment Had Limits ‘from the Very Beginning’,"During Thursday’s comments from the Rose Garden, President Joe Biden claimed the Second Amendment has had limits “from the very beginning.”

Biden said, “No amendment — no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You can’t yell…’fire’ in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech. From the very beginning, you couldn’t own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning that the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren’t allowed to have weapons.”

Believing Second Amendment rights are limited, Biden also believes passing gun control to further restrict those rights is no infringement.

He said, “Nothing — nothing I’m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment. They’re phony, arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we’re talking about.”

But the Bill of Rights serves a different purpose than the Constitution. Whereas the Constitution enumerates powers that the people relegate to the federal government, and also describes how those powers are to be used, the Bill of Rights lists specific rights that the people possess as part of their humanity.

Thomas Jefferson alluded to these rights in the Declaration of Independence, when he said we are “endowed by [our] Creator with certain unalienable rights.” He pointed out that these rights are “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.” A decade and half later the rights were fleshed out with greater specification in the Bill of Rights, with James Madison stating that Americans’ gun rights “shall not be infringed.”

One of the chief purposes of the Bill of Rights was to declare that the people possessed rights integral to their humanity, and those rights were not under the government’s purview (because they did not come from government).

A transcript is as follows:

BILL KRISTOL: Let’s talk about the Republicans for a minute. I still want to get back to the Democrats, but I guess I have the slightly opposite inclination, which is, I don’t know, every time some candidate has 57% at this stage, early as it is, who is well-known and has held high office before, he or she seems to win the nomination, whether it’s Biden, or Hillary Clinton, or Romney and McCain who had lost the two previous times. And there’s such a tendency to — and he still dominates half the party. And so isn’t he still the most likely nominee in 2024? And isn’t his endorsement still going to be a huge plus for people in 2022? And doesn’t that mean we still have a Trumpy Republican party?

JAMES CARVILLE: Okay. Let’s say, all right, 57, you say that’s not a good number. The number was 89, three months ago.

KRISTOL: Yeah.

CARVILLE: That was not going in the right direction. And then, of that 57, it’s something, but I mean, to have a hammer lock on it like he had before, I don’t think that’s going to happen. Plus he’s getting older and he doesn’t have the same access. And we got to see where the Republicans are, but they might be where the Democrats were in 2020: “Shit, let’s just win. Like, okay, this is okay. So the guy is old. Okay. Who cares? We got to win. Doesn’t matter about the age. [Inaudible] Nope, got to be for Biden. He’s the one that has the best chance for winning.” Had it turned out that we would have nominated someone else, Trump would probably still be president.

KRISTOL: Do you agree with that? I’ve discussed that with other people, Biden, probably the only Democrat who beats Trump, the way things turned out in 2020?

CARVILLE: Could be. This defund the police was just a terrible drag on the Democratic party. It really was. Don’t kid yourself. And then they brought Biden, but easy to get sucked into that. And that had a lot to do with why we didn’t do as well as we wanted to.

But of course he’s still a big presence. I just think right now he’s less of a presence than I would have thought in November. And I don’t see it getting, it will be harder for it to go up than it is to go down. It’s going to be very hard.",1
69,Boehner: Jim Jordan Is a Political Terrorist — Ted Cruz Is a ‘Jerk’,"Former House Speaker John Boehner said in a preview video of an interview to be broadcast on “CBS Sunday Morning” that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) was a political terrorist and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) was a “jerk.”

Referencing Boehner’s forthcoming memoir, host John Dickerson said, “You call some of these members political terrorists.”

Boehner said, “Oh, yeah, Jim Jordan, especially my colleague from Ohio. I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart, never building anything, never putting anything together.”

When asked about Cruz, Boehner said, “I don’t beat anybody up. It’s not really my style, except that jerk. Perfect symbol, you know, of getting elected, make a lot of noise, draw a lot of attention to yourself, raise a lot of money, which means you’re going to go make more noise, raise more money, and it’s really — it’s unfortunate.”

71,Claim: Army Official Says Biden Admin Won‘t Kill Dakota Access Pipeline,"Indigenous Environmental Network activist Dallas Goldtooth said Friday that a U.S. Army official told tribal advocates that the federal government does not plan to announce a shutdown of the Dakota Access oil pipeline.

Bloomberg News reports:

The controversial project’s ability to continue to operate would be a rare victory for pipeline owners following President Joe Biden’s decision to cancel the permit for the $9 billion Keystone XL oil line. Even before the Democrat’s inauguration, the oil and gas industry had been struggling to move forward with new infrastructure plans amid stiff opposition from climate advocates. Jensen, who serves as assistant for regulatory and tribal affairs in the Corps office of Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, said in an interview that the matter is in the hands of the Justice Department. Several tribes have already pushed the federal district court in Washington to issue its own shutdown order. The tribes’ motion is pending before the judge, who could issue a decision in the coming weeks.

The report was met with criticism from activists who have long lobbied for shutting down the pipeline, which carries crude oil from North Dakota to an Illinois terminal.

“We are gravely concerned about the continued operation of this pipeline, which poses an unacceptable risk to our sovereign nation,” said Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Mike Faith.

“In a meeting with members of Biden’s staff earlier this year, we were told that this new administration wanted to ‘get this right.’ Unfortunately, this reported update from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shows it has chosen to ignore our pleas and stick to the wrong path,” Faith added.

Neither the USACE nor the Department of Justice have issued an official statement regarding the matter.

Later today, Biden administration lawyers are scheduled to lay out their position on the pipeline during a court hearing.

The development also comes after Dakota Access Pipeline protesters held a demonstration in Washington, D.C., on Thursday by holding what they described as a “die-in.”

The “die-in” was supposed to be a “representation of all the people whose lives have been cut short due to COVID-19 and also fossil fuels,” one activist explained.

The protesters also urged President Joe Biden to stop “climate-destroying projects” and called for the U.S.’s energy sector to go “fossil-free.”

“We have been given another opportunity to protect our water and respect the rights of indigenous people and Mother Earth,” one protester said.",1
73,WATCH: White House Declines to Defend Justice Stephen Breyer from Left-wing Calls to Resign,"White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki declined to defend U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer on Friday from attacks by left-wing groups that say he should resign because he is opposed to packing the Court with additional justices.

The question arose in the wake of Biden’s executive order announcing a commission to study the issue of court-packing.

As Breitbart News reported earlier this week, Breyer opposes the idea:

Justice Stephen Breyer, widely known as one of the three liberal justices on the Supreme Court, warned against left-wing calls to pack America’s highest court with additional justices in order to weaken the conservative majority, explaining during a Tuesday Harvard Law School address that it would “diminish” confidence among the American people. Breyer delivered the remarks on Tuesday in an address in which he said he aimed to “make those whose initial instincts may favor important structural or other similar institutional changes, such as forms of ‘court-packing,’ think long and hard before embodying those changes in law.” The implications, the 82-year-old justice said, would be great and undermine the American people’s confidence in the courts and “in the rule of law itself.” “If the public sees judges as ‘politicians in robes,’ its confidence in the courts, and in the rule of law itself, can only diminish, diminishing the court’s power, including its power to act as a ‘check’ on the other branches,” Breyer explained.

As the Washington Post noted, left-wing groups used his remarks to renew their calls for Breyer to resign to make way for a younger, more radical justice.

On Friday, CBS News White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe asked Psaki to respond to the controversy:

O’Keefe: The president’s commission on expanding the Supreme Court … what is the president’s view of the calls for Justice Breyer to step down? Psaki: He believes that is a decision justice Breyer will make when he decides it’s no longer time to serve on the Supreme Court. O’Keefe: But should the groups pushing him to go back off Psaki: I think I can just speak to what the president’s view is of the Supreme Court justice’s ability to make his own decision.

Throughout the 2020 campaign, Biden dodged questions on court-packing until announcing his plan for a commission.

The Daily Beast reported, May 2018, there were two “late-night Venmo transactions” to an accused sex trafficker, Joel Greenberg. The Beast detailed Gaetz sent $900 in the late-night transaction to Greenberg. The following morning, over the course of eight minutes, “Greenberg used the same app to send three young women varying sums of money. In total, the transactions amounted to $900,” according to the Beast.

In the transactions from Gaetz to Greenberg, the first transaction description said “Test,” and in the second transaction, he wrote, “hit up ___,”according to the Beast. “But instead of a blank, Gaetz wrote a nickname for one of the recipients,” the outlet said, who, in their initial reporting, they intentionally left out the nickname since the “teenager had only turned 18 less than six months before.”

Friday morning, Gaetz is said to have hired the white-collar criminal defense lawyers Marc Mukasey & Isabelle Kirshner. The two of them will lead his legal team.

New: @RepMattGaetz has hired white collar criminal defense lawyers Marc Mukasey & Isabelle Kirshner to lead his legal team. Mukasey has a long history in former President Trump’s orbit, and notably defended SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was acquitted of murder in 2019. — Garrett Haake (@GarrettHaake) April 9, 2021

Last week, Gaetz reportedly said he has no plans to resign after the Hill originally reported he is being investigated by the Department of Justice due to allegations regarding an inappropriate relationship with a minor and violation of sex trafficking laws.

Gaetz won his reelection in 2020 with over 64 percent of the vote.",1
77,Hunter Guarded by Secret Service while Enjoying 'Drug & Prostitute Binge',"Hunter Biden was guarded by taxpayer-funded Secret Service while he enjoyed “a week-long drug and prostitute binge in a Hollywood hotel” in May of 2018, the Daily Mail reports.

According to newly revealed screenshots from Hunter Biden’s largely media-denied but independently authenticated infamous laptop, Hunter refused to come out of his hotel room at the prodding of Secret Service agents.

A bill from May 2018 shows Hunter stayed at the Jeremy Hotel in West Hollywood for seven days on the third floor “ordering room service each night, drinking at the hotel bar and racking up a $5,195 bill – including a $400 fine for smoking in his room,” and sought refilled prescription drugs of stimulant Viagra, antidepressant Lexapro, and anxiety-reducing Clonazepam, according to the report.

“H[unter], I’m in the lobby come down. Thanks,” the message purportedly came from the agent.

Hunter responded, “5 minutes.”

“Come on H this is linked to Celtic’s account. DC is calling me every 10 minutes. Let me up or come down. I can’t help you if you don’t let me H,” the text message read from the officer. According to the Daily Mail, the “Celtic’s account” is “an apparent code name for a senior politician under protection.”

Hunter replied to buy more time, “I promise. Be right down sorry.”

But there was still no sign of Hunter in the lobby.

“Dales here. He a going to front desk call and tell them to give us a key now H. As your friend we need to resolve this in the immediate. Call the front desk now H or I will have to assume you are in danger and we will have to make them give us keys,” the next demand came of Hunter.

Hunter replied, “Really I am coming down right now. I really promise. Was in bathroom buddy. Coming right this second.”

But Hunter apparently did not come down. “We’re at the door. Open it,” the text from the alleged agent says.

The protection in 2018 raises questions of legality, as the Bidens claimed they did not have protection in 2018. Joe Biden lost his secret service protection after his vice presidency.

The Daily Mail also reported, “Press releases by a private security firm published a week after the text exchange with Hunter, announced the agent left the Secret Service after a 25-year career and joined the firm as CEO.”",1
79,Russia Threatens ‘Full-Scale Military Activities’ in East Ukraine,"The Kremlin warned on Friday “full-scale military activities” could occur in eastern Ukraine, blaming increased tensions on the Ukrainian government even as Moscow continues massing forces along the border, to the growing concern of Europe and the United States.

“There are concerns that Ukraine’s civil war will resume. And if a civil war with full-scale military activities resumes near our borders, it will pose a threat to Russia’s national security,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a press conference on Friday. Peskov carefully referred to the situation as a “civil war” despite Ukraine extensively accusing Russia of meddling by supporting and equipping separatist rebels in the region.

“The current developments and Ukraine’s behavior in general create the risk of full-scale military activities. It is clear from various statements that Kyiv does not completely reject the idea of using force to resolve its issue with the southeast,” Peskov claimed.

The Kremlin said on Friday that German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate the situation by pulling his forces back from the Ukrainian border. Putin replied that Russia “has a right to move its military forces around its territory the way it likes.”

Fox News on Thursday rounded up various analysts who said Putin is most likely bluffing, playing to domestic audiences with a bit of militarized nationalist posturing, reminding the West that Russia is still a significant military threat, goading the United States into spending more on advanced weapons, or throwing a fit after President Joe Biden called him a “killer.” None of these analysts thought Russia was making serious plans to invade Ukraine.

The BBC was less sanguine, quoting a top Russian official’s warning that Moscow is ready to “intervene to help Russian-speaking residents in eastern Ukraine if Ukraine launches an all-out assault on separatists there.”

“Everything depends on the scale of the conflagration,” said Dmitry Kozak, deputy head of Putin’s administration.

Kozak said that if Ukraine does something to warrant Russian intervention, it could be the “beginning of the end” for its existence as an independent nation, warning that Moscow will respond with “not a shot in the leg, but in the face.”

Putin and his officials have been suggesting for several years that Ukraine may be planning an ethnic cleansing campaign against ethnic Russians in the eastern Donbass region. Kozak compared the alleged threat to the 1995 slaughter of Muslims in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serbs.

“If, as our president says, there is a Srebrenica there, we shall probably have to come to their defense,” Kozak said of Donbass.

Russia’s military presence on the Ukrainian border has reportedly reached levels not seen since Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014. Ukrainian officials generally downplay the possibility of major escalation, while expressing concern about the death of Ukrainian soldiers from shells fired by the Donbass separatists.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the front lines in Donbass on Friday. He said the ceasefire agreement has been “systematically violated in recent days” by the separatists, and told his forces to maintain their “fighting spirit.”

“Thank you for keeping people calm and defending our land,” Zelensky told the troops as he presented several awards.

The Turkish government announced on Friday that two U.S. Navy warships will sail through the Bosporus Strait next Wednesday, en route to the Black Sea. A Turkish Foreign Ministry official said the notification was passed through “diplomatic channels” 15 days ago. U.S. forces in the Black Sea are well-positioned to monitor Russian activity on the Ukrainian border.

Russia criticized the announced Black Sea deployment for “creating false illusions” in the minds of Ukrainians and giving the U.S. a pretext to “strengthen their own presence in the region.”",1
81,Russia Boasts of 'Natural Immunity' to Coronavirus,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Friday said the Russian population had a high level of “natural immunity” to the Chinese coronavirus that aided in the nation’s efforts to combat the pandemic, according to Tass.

“Thanks to quite precise measures taken last year, we are now in a situation, which specialists characterize as a high immunization level — at least in large cities with a population of over one million people,” Peskov asserted. “It is thanks to this that we find ourselves in a much more favorable environment than many, many other states.”

Peskov emphasized that he was referring to “natural immunity” but did not define the term.

The “precise measures” the government mentioned largely refer to stringent lockdowns, bans on large gatherings, and the government’s efforts to promote its domestic coronavirus vaccine candidate, Sputnik V.

Russian President Vladimir Putin approved the use of Sputnik V for emergency use in August 2020 despite the fact that the product had not completed typically necessary Phase III clinical trials and no health officials seemingly had a role in Putin’s decision. Putin was an accomplished intelligence agent and judoka before taking the helm of the country with no known background in medicine or science. In November 2020, the Russian Gamaleya Institute claimed the vaccine was 92 percent effective. It was unclear if that figure represented the prevention rate for extreme cases or spread in general. A February study revised that figure slightly to 91 percent effective at preventing extreme cases but did not decisively affirm whether Sputnik V could effectively prevent the spread of the disease.

International doubts about the Russian vaccine candidate have hindered Kremlin efforts to export Sputnik V, though it did find a few takers in rogue states like Venezuela and managed to secure a few buyers in Europe.

Domestically, the government began a “large-scale” rollout of Sputnik V in December, particularly targeting teachers and healthcare workers. As of March, however, an estimated three percent of Russia’s population had received the vaccine, suggesting the national rollout’s results may not have been as successful as Peskov presented.

Peskov went on to champion the government’s efforts to contain the pandemic:

But the fact remains: the measures that the state authorities have been taking throughout this year made it possible to live through this period relatively successfully. Here belong the imposition of restrictions and their gradual withdrawal, the differentiation of restrictions depending on the situation in each region, the efforts taken by the authorities in the course of the year and the way our healthcare system was organized.

The Kremlin’s coronavirus “restrictions,” especially the bans on large gatherings, have often conflicted with large-scale protests demanding the release of prominent dissident Alexei Navalny. Russian law enforcement has regularly cited such bans when suppressing the demonstrations.

Russian efforts to enforce its coronavirus restrictions on large gatherings have extended to lawsuits against various social media platforms. It is a crime in Russia to incite minors to attend illegal gatherings. With most large gatherings deemed illegal under coronavirus restrictions, many social media companies have found themselves hosts to a plethora of technically illegal content, which many have refused to delete.",1
83,Philippines: Duterte's Approval Drops 30 Points amid Lockdowns,"Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte scored a 65 percent approval rating, a near 30-point drop from his all-time high in September 2020, for his performance in office over the past four months in an independent poll released this week.

The Philippine pollster Publicus Asia conducted the survey from March 20-29 and found:

[A]pproval and trust ratings of PRRD [President Rodrigo Roa Duterte] remains at a high for a president in his last fifteen months in office. Duterte registers at 65 percent approval, nominally lower than his total approval in December 2020 at 70 percent. His trust rating stands at 55 percent, lower than his trust rating of 62 percent in December.

Approval and Trust Ratings for President Duterte remains at a high in his last fifteen months in office. SP Sotto comes in second, followed by VP Robredo, Ret. CJ Peralta, and Speaker Velasco.#PAHAYAGQ1 Click here to know more: https://t.co/FbzTgn3n5N pic.twitter.com/BKYi57hMDs — Publicus Asia, Inc. (@publicusasia) April 8, 2021

“The purposive sampling survey composed of 1,500 respondents of registered voters was drawn from an online research panel of approximately 100,000 Filipinos maintained by [a] Singapore-based firm,” Publicus Asia wrote of its April 6 survey.

President Duterte’s approval rating has dropped nearly 30 percentage points over the past six months, as he scored a record-high 91 percent approval rating in a survey conducted by the nonprofit Philippine pollster Pulse Asia in September 2020.

Publicus Asia gauged Duterte’s latest approval rating from March 20-29, a time period that coincided with the Philippine government’s decision to lock down the national capital area — Metro Manila, home to 25 million people — to contain the spread of a new regional cluster of Chinese coronavirus cases. The order banned public meetings, including religious gatherings, in Manila during the Philippines’ Easter Holy Week, March 22-April 5. The timing of the religious gathering ban was no doubt met with frustration from many of Manila’s Catholics, as the Philippines is Asia’s largest Roman Catholic nation.

“In the exercise of police powers, we can order the churches closed and I hope it will not come to that,” President Duterte’s spokesman, Harry Roque, said at a regular press briefing on March 23 when asked about a rumored plan by Manila priests to proceed with Easter masses despite the gathering ban.

Duterte’s lockdown order also banned indoor dining at all Metro Manila restaurants, prohibited non-essential travel into and out of the capital, and forced residents to observe a strict 6:00 pm curfew. The restrictions, which were extended by the Philippine government for an additional week on April 5, also apply to four of Manila’s outlying provinces: Laguna, Bulacan, Cavite, and Rizal.

Metro Manila is no stranger to stay-at-home orders, as it endured one of the world’s longest and strictest coronavirus lockdowns from March-June 2020, also ordered by Duterte. The president infamously issued a “shoot to kill” order to Philippine police last April if they encountered quarantine violators in public after curfew.",1
85,Fox News Hires Mike Pompeo as Network Contributor,"Fox News has hired former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as a contributor, making his first appearance on Friday’s “FOX & Friends.”

“Mike Pompeo is one of America’s most recognized and respected voices on foreign policy and national security issues. I look forward to his contributions across our range of platforms to share his distinct perspective with our millions of viewers,” Fox News’ CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement.

Pompeo will be a commentator across all Fox News Media platforms, which includes Fox Business Network’s daytime and primetime programming.

“I intend to give viewers a candid, no-nonsense look at geopolitics, international relations, and the America First policies that helped chart the course for unprecedented American prosperity and security,” Pompeo said in the announcement.

The press release noted Pompeo’s history of serving as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency before becoming Secretary of State under former President Donald Trump in which he was “instrumental in the decision to strike top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani,” along with orchestrating the “administration’s maximum-pressure campaign against the Islamic Republic of Iran which brought the Middle East closer to peace.”",1
87,Lancet Medical Journal: ‘Racism Is the Public Health Crisis’,"The woke Lancet medical journal praises the Black Lives Matter protests in its latest issue, urging greater activism to overcome white supremacy.

In an article titled “Racism Is the Public Health Crisis,” UK-based Professor of Black Studies Kehinde Andrews asserts that the Black Lives Matter movement “needs to be seen in the wider context of the mobilisations during the 20th century, ranging from civil rights and Black Power to the Third World movements across the globe.”

Racism needs to be confronted as a systemic problem embedded in western society and its institutions, Andrews insists, rather than a problem of individual prejudice.

An unfortunate pattern can be detected in how western society deals with crises of racism involving “shock, hand-wringing, and commitment to change, but no commitment to systemic change,” Andrews laments.

“Racism is typically reduced to individual acts of prejudice or seen as a series of flashpoints, usually triggered by some violent act,” he writes. “When confronted with an unavoidable truth about the nature of inequality, some politicians and policy makers seem reluctant to come to terms with the realities of structural racism.”

The U.K.-based Lancet medical journal has denounced “medical racism” in the United States as part of purported ongoing “structural violence” present in the country. https://t.co/RPKmEQ39u3 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 5, 2020

As an example, Andrews asserts that “the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on racialised minority groups is not an issue of genetics but of racial oppression.”

“The fact that racialised minority communities are also far more likely to have comorbidities should be a reminder that racial health disparities exist for many health outcomes,” he maintains.

The racialised impact of the coronavirus is just a symptom of an underlying problem, Andrews suggests, which is in turn the result of “white supremacy.”

“Once we connect the dots between health inequalities and wider racial oppression, then we understand that racism is the underlying condition,” he declares.

“White supremacy is the idea that there is a hierarchy inherent to the chain of human beings, with those who are white at the top and Black people at the bottom,” Andrews states, which helps explain the poverty of sub-Saharan Africa.

The once prestigious Lancet medical journal has called on the Biden administration to significantly increase U.S. funding of the United Nations and the W.H.O. https://t.co/n17mHi6yEZ — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 4, 2021

“Global poverty maps neatly onto the framework of white supremacy, with the west the richest and some African countries the poorest,” he asserts. “That some countries in Africa have the lowest life expectancy on the planet is not a coincidence. The unjust racial order is a key contributor to the health challenges in Africa.”

“Racism is a defining feature of western countries, creating a society where Black life is devalued,” Andrews concludes. “The hierarchy of white supremacy creates an uneven distribution of resources and means that the majority of those who are not white are subject to various health inequalities.”

“To make Black lives matter, we need to understand that racism is the public health crisis,” he declares.

89,FNC’s Carlson: ‘Nothing the Democratic Party Advocates for Is More Dishonest than Gun Control’,"Thursday, FNC’s Tucker Carlson reacted to President Joe Biden’s pledge to use his executive authority to restrict Second Amendment rights earlier in the day.

Carlson called Biden’s pick to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms “unhinged” and said efforts to curb gun rights were steeped in the government’s desire for control.

Transcript as follows:

CARLSON: We often accuse politicians of dishonesty on this show, but there are grades of it. Let’s boil it down. Nothing the Democratic Party advocates for is more dishonest than gun control. Everything about that one specific issue is false.

Most policy debates actually aren’t like that, and we try to be honest about it on this show. No matter how passionate you are about a position that you have, you can still sort of see what the other side is talking about. You might, for example deeply dislike taxes, but you can still acknowledge it is fair to charge people for the services they receive from the government.

So their side isn’t crazy. They just arrived at a different number than you did.

Or you can hate abortion, and we do, and you can still understand if again, if we are being totally honest about it, why a scared pregnant teenager might be tempted to have one.

But gun control is not like that. Gun control is entirely fraudulent.

The Democratic Party claims that guns cause violence. That’s the core claim, and it is a lie. It is probably untrue. The places in this country that have the most guns, and the loosest controls on those guns also have the least gun violence, the fewest killings. That’s the bottom line. You can look it up, it’s publicly available to anyone.

Anyone who tries to restrict your legally owned firearms is not trying to make America safer. The point is to disarm you, to strip you of your autonomy, your power, your right of self-defense.

Gun control is not about guns. Gun control is about who controls America.’

Is it the population as in a democracy? Or does all control go to a small group of authoritarians as in an oligarchy? Those are the stakes in the gun control debate. It’s not about guns, it’s about who runs the country.

So with that in mind, Joe Biden’s speech today, calling for more gun control should make you uncomfortable. Almost nothing Biden said was true. We could go down the list, but here are a few highlights to give you the flavor.

Biden claimed that firearms purchased at gun shows are exempt from background checks. That’s a lie as anyone who has ever been to a gun show can tell you.

Joe Biden claimed that gun manufacturers have total immunity against lawsuits. That’s also a lie. Gun manufacturers get sued all the time, ask them, et cetera.

So, it was a speech aimed to mislead rather than to inform.

Before he announced how he plans to restrict your Second Amendment rights, Joe Biden wanted to remind you those rights are not real in the first place. They are not as he put it, absolute.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nothing I’m about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment. They are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake of what we’re talking about.

But no amendment — no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: You heard the sirens in the background responding to the skyrocketing crime rate in the city he presides over. But the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. That’s the promise in the U.S. Constitution.

But according to Joe Biden, it’s still not an absolute right despite what the text says. No, that right is subject to his approval and his interpretation. Joe Biden is in charge of the Constitution now. Joe Biden defines its terms, and Joe Biden has decided that something called stabilizing braces can no longer be allowed.

Now, a stabilizing brace is used by target shooters to hold heavy firearms. They play zero role in the murder epidemic now underway in our cities. Then why is Joe Biden banning them without the approval of Congress? Probably because up to 40 million law-abiding Americans own this device, and under this order, Joe Biden’s order, every one of those people will have to alert Federal authorities and pay hundreds of dollars in fines for the crime of owning a harmless piece of plastic that was legal yesterday.

And if they don’t comply, Joe Biden’s Federal authorities can then drag them off in handcuffs, seize their property and charge them with a felony. So with a single stroke of a pen, Joe Biden just turned tens of millions of overwhelmingly Republican voters into criminals.

Is it starting to make sense now? Think about that for a minute and you’ll begin to understand why the Democratic Party is so focused on what they call weapons of war. You might know them as semi-automatic small-caliber sporting rifles that normal people use for hunting and target shooting and home defense.

Here’s the thing that you should know, and again, don’t take our word for it. Look it up. No subject is more carefully cataloged than gun violence. Guns like this, these so-called weapons of war play no meaningful role in crime.

Virtually all gun murders in this country are committed with handguns. A small number of people, again provable, a small number of people are responsible for most of the violence and the use of small variety of weapons to commit it.

Those weapons are not rifles. Here are the numbers. According to most recent data from the FBI, firearms were involved in a total of 10,258 homicides in 2019, the last year for which data are available. Fewer than 500, out of more than 10,000 of those homicides were committed with rifles — rifles of all kinds, including so-called weapons of war.

So criminals don’t use rifles, they’re not concealable. Maybe that’s why. In fact, more people were murdered with knives than with rifles.

So if you actually cared about making the country safer, keeping people from getting murdered, you would target handguns in big cities. That’s where the murders are. That’s where the violence is.

But the administration is doing the opposite of this, the mirror image of this. The Biden administration is letting big city criminals go. People who use guns for violence are walking out of jail, and instead, the Biden administration is using, you saw it today, the full force of government to disarm peaceful voters in zip codes that voted for Donald Trump. It is that simple.

Today, Biden announced that he wants to ban what he calls assault weapons. He is speaking about the AR-15, which is the single most popular sporting rifle in America.

So the question is, if we banned so-called assault weapons, would the country become safer? That’s the only question that matters? We don’t need to guess about the answer because we tried this before.

Under Bill Clinton, for 10 full years, we banned assault rifles, and then by law, the Department of Justice studied the effects, so we know the effect and you again can look it up if you want. It didn’t work.

In fact, once that ban expired in 2004, gun homicides fell in almost every major city. So policies like this one are unhinged from reality, to put it gently.

So to enforce them, Joe Biden has nominated a man who is unhinged from reality. His name is David Chipman, and he will now run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, an agency that Joe Biden referred to today as the AFT.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BIDEN: Today, I’m proud to nominate David Chipman to serve as a Director of AFT. David knows the AFT well.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: David knows AFT well. Hilarious. If you’re Joe Biden, everything is a teachers union. The AFT is a teachers union.

So who is David Chipman? Well, he’s a conspiracy nut for one thing. In a recent internet post on Reddit, he claimed that the Branch Davidians shut down helicopters during the Waco siege in 1993. No, they didn’t. No one aboard a Federal helicopter was shot or injured that day, the helicopters didn’t crash.

That is a bizarre claim to make from someone who is directly involved in the case as David Chipman was. But it’s worse than that, in 1993, the ATF killed dozens of innocent children and at least one pregnant woman for no obvious reason. It’s one of the worst things that Federal agents have ever done in this country.

So if you’re taking over the ATF, maybe you could apologize for that. But no, David Chipman lied about it and then attacked the dead. It was like blaming the Japanese for their own internment or attacking the victims of the Tuskegee Experiment for getting syphilis.

It was not evidence of a generous spirit. It was evidence of zealot.

This is the man Joe Biden just nominated to lead ATF.

But it gets worse than that. In a Reddit post, David Chipman suggested that people who fail background checks should be arrested on the spot, quote: “While at ATF I conducted studies involving people who failed background checks to determine how many later committed crimes with a gun, many did. This is a perfect opportunity to arrest people before committing crimes, rather than responding after the fact.”

Arrest people before they commit crimes. That is a brand new concept in American law, but the Chinese are highly familiar with it. But the suggestion does raise a point of pressing interest to the Biden family. Joe Biden just appointed a guy who thinks people who lie on Federal firearms background checks should go to prison.

Oh, well. Do you know any? Hunter Biden purchased a handgun illegally. He lied on the Federal background check. That’s not speculation, he did. We’ve seen the form.

So the question is, will David Chipman arrest the President’s son? And if he doesn’t arrest the President’s son, the question is, how exactly are you obligated to follow these rules? That’s a serious question.

Can you live in a country where the rules don’t apply to the President’s son, but you could go to jail for violating them? How can you participate in a system like that?

Again, sincere question. They should explain.

We should note that David Chipman has said a lot of other things on the internet that he doesn’t want you to see. He’s locked his Twitter account so that nobody can read it. But “The Daily Wire” found an archived version of his Twitter page and compared it to his current page.

They found that David Chipman deleted at least a thousand tweets in recent days. And we can only speculate about what he said in those posts. We do know that what he said publicly tells us all we need to know about how he got this job.

In October 2018, for example, David Chipman told “The Hill” that AR-15s should be treated, quote, “just like machine guns.” Well, machine guns are banned in this country. He believes AR-15 is the single most popular rifle in America, it should be banned.

Chipman made that remark in his capacity as a policy adviser for an anti-gun group, one of the many funded by Michael Bloomberg. In 2012, he suggested to MSNBC that the Secret Service shouldn’t carry firearms. And last year, David Chipman openly mocked the millions of Americans who were buying firearms to protect their families from the crime wave that David Chipman’s party has unleashed on the country.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DAVID CHIPMAN, PRESIDENT BIDEN’S NOMINEE TO LEAD A.T.F.: They might think that they are die-hard, ready to go. But unfortunately, they’re more like Tiger King, and they are putting themselves and their families in danger.

And so what I would suggest is for those people who were first-time gun owners, if they did go out and buy a gun, I would secure that gun locked and unloaded and hide it behind the cans of tuna and beef jerky that you have stored in a cabinet. And, you know, only bring that out if the zombies start to appear, and I don’t think they are.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: It’s hard to imagine a flippant remark that’s more infuriating than that one. If you bought a gun to protect your family, your business, your home during the riots that these people unleashed on the country, a conspiracy nut running the ATF calls you crazy.

That’s why if you made the mistake of buying a handgun with a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds, in other words, if you bought a Glock 19, or any of the most popular handguns sold in America, you will be obligated to surrender it to that guy.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

QUESTION: And high capacity means what kind of numbers are we talking about?

CHIPMAN: Yes, so I think the consensus has been around 10 and there are a number of reasons why.

QUESTION: Ten and above would be high?

CHIPMAN: Yes, well, I think, let’s say 10 and below are okay or reasonable, above would be regulated.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: So this raises a lot of questions. Why is David Chipman allowed to decide how many rounds you’re allowed in your magazine? What does he know about that? Is he in charge of protecting your family? Does he live in your neighborhood?

Are your children his responsibility? It’s outrageous. But worse than that, it is theater. It’s not real. People like David Chipman aren’t opposed to gun violence. In fact, people like David Chipman and his party certainly are making gun violence possible in this country.

We could give you many examples, we have for years. Here’s a new one. In Washington, the city is planning to stop enforcing gun laws. Really? The party that thinks guns cause violence is no longer pulling them off the street. Why? Because it’s racially insensitive to do that.

A D.C. Police Commander called John Haines just sent a memo announcing this policy, quote: “No longer are we focused on getting guns.” Huh? Aren’t they telling us at the other side of their mouth that your guns are their problems? Right? Your guns. Not the criminals’ guns, your guns, because you’re the criminal now.

Meanwhile, in Chicago, where a 21-month-old child was just shot on the street last month, Mayor Lori Lightfoot has decided that not all guns need to be removed from the streets. No, just the one thing you own.

According to Lori Lightfoot, the real danger is not handguns, it is, quote, “military-grade weapons from other states.”

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): Tuesday, little Kayden Swann was shot on Lakeshore Drive. Eighteen others were shot, five of them died.

Wednesday, Mayor Lori Lightfoot said part of the crime issue is gun control.

MAYOR LORI LIGHTFOOT (D), CHICAGO, ILLINOIS: If you can go over the border in Indiana and literally by military-grade weapons with any quantity.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): C.P.D. numbers show that crime is up. Around this time last year, there were 521 people shot. Now, that number is 743.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: This is one of those topics that’s hard to do on TV, because in about an hour, you can learn more about this topic, actual facts about this topic that every single person making the policy, everything they say is untrue and provably so. There’s no issue in which they lie more than this one, which tells you a lot.

Lori Lightfoot’s statement, the one you just saw is a shocking lie, and Chicago’s own data prove it. Most violent crimes in Illinois were committed with guns purchased in the state. According to Chicago Police, from 2018 to 2019, authorities encountered a grand total of — how many people armed with military gear rifles or all rifles? Four. Four people in the whole city in a year with rifles. That’s it.

And that’s what Lori Lightfoot is focused on.

In that same period, they encountered 44 people armed with revolvers. They encountered 15 people armed with chemical weapons, whatever that is, and there are 32 people wielding their feet in a violent manner; and the rest of course, for semi-automatic handguns. That’s all the murders are committed with, and everyone knows it.

Rifles are not a real threat in Chicago, and they haven’t been for a long time, if ever. Between 2013 and 2016, just 4.8 percent of guns recovered by the Chicago Police were rifles, 4.8 percent. The most recent murder report from Chicago was from all the way back in 2011. They’re a little slow in the numbers there.

But according to that report, just one rifle was used in a homicide in the City of Chicago. One. And that’s what they want to take away. Why? Because you own it, not the criminals.

In the decade that followed, a George Soros-funded DA called Kim Foxx took over in Chicago and during her tenure, prosecutors started dropping cases for serious gun crimes, not accidentally, but as a matter of policy. They intentionally dropped gun crimes, aggravated battery with a firearm, unlawful use of a weapon, reckless discharge of a firearm, aggravated discharge, serious crimes involving guns. They dropped the charges.

They’re not worried about gun crime. They’re worried about you protecting yourself.

And not just in Chicago, across the country. Criminals who commit violence with guns are going free. Murder rates are hitting record levels. Meanwhile, you haven’t hurt anyone, you haven’t done anything wrong. But suddenly, Hunter Biden has a fat book contract from Simon & Schuster, and you’re a felon for trying to defend your home. You can see what’s going on here.

Again, they’re not trying to control guns. They’re trying to control you.",1
91,"Carney: Welcome to Biden’s America, Where the Poor Pay More","The first two months of the presidency of Joe Biden have not been a particularly auspicious period in which to be black, poor, or working class in America.

The unemployment rate for black Americans fell for eight consecutive months as Donald Trump’s tenure in the White House marched toward its end, falling from 16.7 percent to 9.2 percent in January, one of the swiftest decline in unemployment in recorded economic history. It jumped back up to 9.9 percent in February and only slightly recovered to 9.6 percent in March.

It isn’t just black Americans that are suffering. Lower-income Americans of all races have also seen setbacks in the early months of the Biden administration.

The latest data on prices from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that prices jumped much higher than expected in March. The annual gain of 4.2 percent is the highest since 2011, although this is somewhat of a statistical illusion created by the depression in demand for goods and services after our political leaders ordered everyone to shelter at home to protect themselves from Covid-19. But even the monthly gains exceeded expectations, rising 1 percent compared with a forecast of half that.

Inflation weighs particularly hard on those at the lower end of the income scale. A much larger share of income goes into current consumption, so higher prices squeeze budgets more. Meager savings are much more likely to be in low-interest paying bank accounts than in equities or inflation hedged investments, so they are vulnerable to to the deterioration of the buying power of the U.S. dollar.

The details of March’s price hike make it even clearer that the early Biden era inflation is weighing particularly on the bottom end of the income scale. Gasoline prices, for example, rose 8.8 percent in March. The lower third of household incomes spend more on transportation than the upper two thirds, according to long-running data from Pew Charitable Trusts. In 2019, transportation costs—of which the price of gasoline is a major component—accounted for 17 percent of all household expenditures, according to Statista, the second biggest category after housing.

Food is third in line after transportation and housing, accounting for 13 percent of household spending. The March Producer Price Index indicates food prices rose half a percentage point in March and 1.3 percent in February. Over the past 12-months, food prices are up 5 percent.

Contrast the shares of household spending with the top income brackets. The top third of spend around 8 percent of household income on transportation, according to Pew Charitable Trusts. Statista gives higher figures for the top quintiles but still a good deal below the bottom quintiles. The same goes for food—it takes up less of a wealthier family’s income and makes up less of its monthly expenditures.

What’s more, wealthier households are more likely to benefit from the “upside” of inflation because they have more fixed interest rate debt that gets to be paid back in depreciated dollars in an inflationary environment. By contrast, households with floating rate debt—such as credit cards—do not benefit because the rates tend to rise alongside inflation. Similarly, lower-income households are more likely to rent their homes than upper-income households, and rents rise with inflation.

Inflation, particularly food and gasoline price hikes, acts as a regressive tax, hurting low-income households more than higher income households.

Biden, who won office on a promise to combat inequality and only hike taxes on very wealthy Americans, has presided over a stealth inflation-tax hike over lower-income households.

Welcome to Biden’s America, where the poor pay more.",1
93,Inflation Scare: Producer Price Index Surges Much Higher Than Expected,"Prices received by wholesalers and producers of goods and services rose much faster than expected in March, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed Friday.

The Producer Price Index rose 1 percent in March, more than twice the consensus forecast. On a year-over-year basis, the index is up 4.2 percent, higher than the expected 3.8 percent. That is the fastest pace of price gains since September 2011, when prices climbed 4.5 percent.

The release of the index data was delayed by over 20 minutes when the BLS website crashed on Friday morning.

The PPI measures prices received by businesses, while the more familiar Consumer Price Index measures prices paid by consumers. The two tend to track each other over time but can vary from month to month. Producer prices rose 0.5 percent in February and 1.3 percent in January.

The year-over-year measure was expected to rise dramatically because last year’s prices were depressed by the sudden imposition of lockdown orders in March 2020. Even still, the gain beat those expectations.

Prices for final demand goods—those sold to businesses and households after their last stage of production—rose 1.7 percent in March, the largest increase since the index began in December 2009. The inflation in goods prices accounted for 60 percent of the overall gains in the index.

In a coincidental symmetry, 60 percent of the rise in the price of goods was attributable to the rise in energy prices. A quarter of the rise of the prices of goods was caused by an 8.8 percent rise in the price of gasoline. On an annual basis, gasoline prices were up 52 percent, reflecting the crash in gas prices as people were told to stay at home and avoid travel last year.

Food prices moved up 0.5 percent after rising 1.3 percent in February. On an annual basis, food prices are up 7.0 percent.

The index for final demand services moved up 0.7 percent. Nearly half of the broad-based increase in March is attributable to margins for final demand trade services, which moved up 1.0 percent. Trade services measures the margins of retailers, the difference between what they pay for goods and what they receive for selling them to customers.

Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, producer prices moved up 0.7 percent, well above expectations for a 0.2 percent gain. On an annual basis, prices ex-food and energy were up 3.1 percent. Economists had forecast a 2.3 percent gain.

Excluding food, energy, and trade services, the PPI moved up 0.6 percent, higher than the 0.2 percent expected. On an annual basis, these prices were up 3.1 percent compared with 2.5 percent expected.",1
95,"Democrat Sen. Blumenthal Says DeSantis Suing CDC, Feds for Cruise Industry","Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) on Friday described Gov. Ron DeSantis’s (R-FL) decision to take legal action against the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and federal government — for leaving the cruise industry in a perpetual state of limbo — as a “craven political stunt.”

The Connecticut senator believes the Florida governor is actively “pandering to cruise companies,” which have been heavily impacted by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, unable to sail out of the Sunshine State — home to some of the busiest ports across the globe.

“Gov. DeSantis suing the CDC is a craven political stunt pandering to cruise companies,” Blumenthal said, accusing the Florida governor of seeming to care “more about their profits than passengers at risk of COVID-19.”

“No way should the CDC send cruise ships to sea now,” he added:

DeSantis announced legal action against the CDC and federal government during a press conference at Port Miami on Thursday, attributing the decision to the government effectively locking down the entire industry for over a year with no clear end in sight for the industry, which the Miami Herald reports is “responsible for nearly $9 billion in annual economic impact to Florida.”

“This is not reasonable. This is not rational,” DeSantis said, explaining it is time to “vindicate the state’s rights and the rights of the state in court and also vindicate the livelihoods of the tens of thousands of Floridians who depend on this industry.”

DeSantis, who has led the way in prioritizing freedom throughout the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, also addressed critics, explaining the industry “doesn’t need a bureaucratic overseer to ensure the safety of its customers.”

“If you are worried about Americans, well, they just will cruise off another coast,” he explained. “Instead of flying to Miami, spending money to stay in our hotels, spending money to eat in our restaurants before they get on the ship, they’re going to fly to the Bahamas.”

Florida is home to three of the busiest ports in the world — Port Miami, Port Canaveral, and Port Everglades.

97,Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon Signs Bill Protecting Infants Surviving Abortion,"Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon (R) signed into law Wednesday a bill that mandates infants who survive an abortion receive the same medical treatment as any other infant born alive.

Senate File 34, known as “Born alive infant-means of care,” states:

The commonly accepted means of care that would be rendered to any other infant born alive shall be employed in the treatment of any viable infant aborted alive. Any physician performing an abortion shall take medically appropriate and reasonable steps to preserve the life and health of an infant born alive.

As Catholic News Agency (CNA) reported, Gordon vetoed a similar bill last year.

“Last year’s bill was different from the one brought this year,” Michael Pearlman, communications director for Gordon, told CNA. “In the Governor’s opinion, this bill met with the Governor’s pro-life and pro-family convictions.”

The new law will go into effect in July.

Nathan Winters, executive director of Family Policy Alliance of Wyoming, celebrated the new law.

“With the resounding support of the Wyoming legislature and endorsement of the Governor, Wyoming has taken the important step of protecting these vulnerable citizens taking their first breath of Wyoming air,” he said in a statement, and added:

This legislation will stand as a silent but strong guardian over any infant surviving an abortion by requiring that medical professionals carry out their ethical and medical duty to provide appropriate medical care or genuine comfort care for a newborn. While physicians can determine what “appropriate and reasonable steps” should be taken, this new law ensures that the next step can’t be to do nothing.

The pro-life Susan B. Anthony List sponsored a poll in February 2019 that found 77 percent of Americans support legislation that would ensure babies who survive abortion would be administered the same medical treatment as would any infant born prematurely at the same age.

That outcome included 75 percent of independent voters and 70 percent of Democrats.

While abortion rights activists frequently use talking points that claim a federal Born-Alive Act is not “necessary” because Congress already passed the 2002 Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, or because infanticide is already illegal under homicide laws, Patrina Mosley, Family Research Council’s director of Life, Culture, and Women’s Advocacy, addressed the issue in February 2020:

Congress did pass the 2002 Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, but that was only a definitional change stating that all infants who survive abortion are full persons under the law. It neither required any medical care for infants born-alive nor included a provision for prosecuting anyone who failed to provide care.

Mosley also referred to the murder conviction of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell to make another point about homicide law:

Under current homicide law, there is a distinction between active and passive killing. Active killing is what happened with Pennsylvania abortionist Kermit Gosnell, when he snipped the necks and spines of infants who were, according to him, “big enough to walk him to the bus stop.” Eyewitnesses who worked with Texas abortionist Douglas Karpen testified that he regularly killed babies born alive by snipping their spinal cords, fatally injuring them with blows to the soft spot on their heads, and twisting their necks. Gosnell was convicted on three counts of murder under Pennsylvania homicide statue that included prosecutions for infanticide.

“But what about an abortionist that simply leaves the infant to die?” Mosley asked. “The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require an active duty physician to treat a child that needs help when he or she is born alive after an abortion. If you kill that child you will have committed murder. At present, if you leave the child to die, you’re not guilty of anything.”

Melanie Israel, research associate at the Heritage Foundation, also noted in February 2019 that current federal policy is not sufficient to protect babies who survive a botched abortion.

The 2002 Born-Alive Act “clarifies for purposes of federal law that ‘every infant … who is born alive at any stage of development’ is a ‘person,’ regardless of the circumstances—including induced abortion—surrounding birth,” Israel observed. “But it does not specify the obligations surrounding duty of care for such infants.”",1
99,Cardinal Burke: Pro-Abortion Politicians May Not Receive Communion,"ROME — Catholic politicians who publicly promote the practice of abortion on demand may not receive Holy Communion, Cardinal Raymond Burke declared this week.

A Catholic “who publicly and obstinately opposes the truth regarding faith and morals may not present himself or herself to receive Holy Communion and neither may the minister of Holy Communion give him or her the Sacrament,” said Cardinal Burke in extended statement posted on April 7.

For many years, Burke — a canon lawyer and the former head of the Vatican’s highest court — has insisted Canon Law forbids politicians who defend and promote abortion from receiving Communion, but this teaching takes on special relevance in the case of President Joe Biden, a Catholic who actively supports abortion on demand.

The cardinal said many have asked him how Catholic politicians and civil officials who publicly and obstinately defend and promote the practice of abortion on demand can approach to receive Holy Communion.

The answer, he says, is simple: they should not do so and if they do, the minister of Holy Communion should refuse to give it to them.

“The reception of Holy Communion by those who publicly and obstinately violate the moral law in its most fundamental precepts is a particularly grave form of sacrilege,” Burke asserts, citing the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

“It not only merits eternal punishment for the one who receives unworthily but constitutes a most serious scandal for others,” he adds, in that “it leads them into the false belief that one can publicly and obstinately violate the moral law in a grave matter and still receive Our Lord in Holy Communion.”

“The denial of Holy Communion is not an ecclesiastical penalty but the recognition of the objectively unworthy state of a person to approach to receive Holy Communion,” he notes.

The cardinal states that priests and bishops have the duty to instruct and admonish the faithful who are such a condition and if a person has been admonished and still perseveres in grave public sin, “he or she may not be admitted to receive Holy Communion.”

Citing Pope Saint John Paul II, Burke asserts that “direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, always constitutes a grave moral disorder, since it is the deliberate killing of an innocent human being.”

Burke dismisses the idea that a politician can be “personally opposed” to the grave evil of abortion while publicly defending and promoting it.

Denying Holy Communion to politicians who obstinately persevere in grave sin is not a politicization of Holy Communion, Burke insists, but forms part of “the Church’s solemn responsibility to safeguard the holiness of the Holy Eucharist, to prevent the faithful from committing sacrilege, and to prevent scandal among the faithful and other persons of good will.”

With an apparent nod toward President Biden, the cardinal warns of a Catholic politician who “presents himself or herself as a devout Catholic, while the truth is completely otherwise.”

Along with the denial of Holy Communion, those who publicly and obstinately violate the moral law “are, at least, in a state of apostasy, that is, they have effectively abandoned the faith by the obstinate refusal, in practice, to live in accord with fundamental truths of faith and morals,” Burke states. “An apostate from the faith incurs automatically the penalty of excommunication.”

“The Bishop of such a person must verify the conditions for the declaration of the penalty of excommunication, which has been automatically incurred,” he adds.

“In conclusion, Church discipline, beginning with the Apostle Paul, has consistently taught the necessary disposition of conscience for the reception of Holy Communion,” Burke writes, and thus a pro-abortion Catholic politician “may not present himself or herself to receive Holy Communion and neither may the minister of Holy Communion give him or her the Sacrament.”

101,North Dakota House Passes Bill to End School’s Ties to Planned Parenthood,"Lawmakers in the North Dakota House passed legislation Wednesday that would block North Dakota State University (NDSU) from providing federal grant funds to a sex education program linked to abortion provider Planned Parenthood.

Legislators in the state have long expressed opposition to the sex ed program because of its ties with Planned Parenthood. As Inforum.com reported, during the 2019 legislative session, 89 North Dakota lawmakers wrote to NDSU to express their disapproval of NDSU’s “public partnership with Planned Parenthood.”

SB 2030, which is a funding bill for the state’s Higher Education Challenge Matching Grant, passed the state House, 66-25, with an amendment that prevents schools from entering into contracts with abortion providers.

The bill now returns to the state Senate, where the original measure blocked federal grant dollars to North Dakota’s ten other colleges and universities as well, unless NDSU terminated its arrangement with Planned Parenthood.

While the House’s amended bill would hold other schools harmless, the legislation would still penalize any institution that contracts with “a person that performs or promotes the performance of an abortion,” by cutting its operating budget by 2.5 percent.

For NDSU, the measure could mean a $2.8 million cut in funding.

Additionally, a school official who enters into a contract with an abortion provider could also face a misdemeanor charge that would draw a 30-day prison sentence and a $1,500 fine.

NDSU officials argued state lawmakers are restricting their academic freedom by preventing them from applying for grants with ties to abortion providers, reported the Grand Forks Herald.

“I understand that this committee and the Legislature may wish to punish NDSU for these academic matters,” NDSU President Dean Bresciani testified regarding the amendment. “However, the principles of academic freedom and freedom of speech are fundamental to how NDSU, and all colleges and universities, operate and must be maintained for accreditation purposes.”

Bresciani said he would not bow to political pressure.

However, Sen. Janne Myrdal (R), who proposed the amendment, said the measure was already in keeping with a chapter in the state code that specifies:

No funds of this state or any agency, county, municipality, or any other subdivision thereof and no federal funds passing through the state treasury or a state agency may be used as family planning funds by any person or public or private agency which performs, refers, or encourages abortion.

Myrdal countered to NDSU officials who argued the Planned Parenthood sex education program would teach at-risk youth to avoid pregnancy, “I would wager to say that what they teach is pretty high-risk, and I won’t repeat any of what that organization teaches because it’s pretty R-rated information.”",1
103,"WATCH: Fore, Dad! McIlroy Sends Errant Masters Shot off his Father","AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Rory McIlroy hit his approach on the seventh hole Thursday at the Masters right where he was aiming.

Problem was, he was aiming at his father.

Here’s a tale that will be part of McIlroy family lore for probably forever: Gerry McIlroy was standing near the right side of the green, watching his son play his second shot from off to the left of the fairway. The ball wound up hitting Gerry McIlroy in the left leg.

Rory McIlroy accidentally hits his dad with this shot during the Masters 😂 (via @CBSSports)pic.twitter.com/FYKWq00lCX — Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) April 8, 2021

“It was a perfect shot,” Rory McIlroy said.

Well, kind of. He wound up making bogey, which was his third consecutive one at that point.

“It was dead straight,” Rory McIlroy said. “But I think he was OK. He didn’t limp away. He walked away pretty swiftly, so that was all right.”

Gerry McIlroy is a pretty good golfer himself. He introduced his son to the game long ago, and has developed quite a following among his fellow members at his home course, Seminole Golf Club in Florida.

He’ll be getting mileage off this story for years.

Rory McIlroy also had a tee shot spray right on the par-4 11th, causing some patrons to tap-dance out of the way. He finished with a 4-over 76, not exactly boosting his chances of finally winning a Masters and completing the career grand slam.

There’s a tradition of sorts in golf that when someone gets struck by an errant ball, the golfer signs a glove and presents it to the person as a part-apology, part-souvenir. McIlroy didn’t seem like he was planning to give one to his dad.

“I think he just needs to go and put some ice on,” he said. “Maybe I’ll autograph a bag of frozen peas for him.”",1
105,'Remember The Titans' School Dumping T.C. Williams Name Over Claims of Racism,"Virginia’s T.C. Williams High School, made famous by the feature film Remember the Titans starring Denzel Washington, is dumping its 56-year-old name over ties to racism.

When the school opened in 1965, it was named after former school superintendent Thomas Chambliss Williams, a strict segregationist during the 1930s. The school has long criticized its namesake, and on its website, the school system says that Williams and his history “could not have been more inconsistent with the vibrant, diverse and inclusive place we know today.”

The site adds that Williams “did everything possible to slow down the process of integration in Alexandria.” And the district has debated changing the name for some time.

The school came to national attention when the school integrated in the 1970s and went on to have a winning football team that helped to unite the community. The history of the school became the topic of a hit film in the year 2000.

In November, a unanimous vote was held, giving the district the go-ahead to change the school’s name, kicking off a campaign to pick a new name. The district settled on a list of names in November and finally chose Alexandria City High for its new name.

🔵⚪🔴 It's official! The School Board has voted and the new school name for @tcwtitans is Alexandria City High School! The new school name will be implemented starting July 1, 2021. #ForeverTheTitans #RememberTheTitans pic.twitter.com/R4rARtXy9K — Alexandria City Public Schools (@ACPSk12) April 8, 2021

The name change will take effect in July, the district reported.

The district reported that the name change would cost $350,000 to implement.

107,David Wells Rips MLB for Moving ASG: 'I Don't Watch Baseball Anymore',"Former MLB great David Wells is blasting MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred for pulling the league’s All-Star Game out of Atlanta in response to Georgia’s voter reform law.

Wells let fly with his criticisms on Thursday during an episode of the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio:

I’ve had a lot of dealings with Rob Manfred back in my playing days, and I never liked the guy. I thought he was a bit odd. He never understood anything. To me, how do you change the games, the dynamics, and hurt a city like Atlanta that really needs some income in that situation? I mean, Atlanta’s a great place to play baseball.

Georgia’s recently passed an election reform law to make it more difficult for voter fraud to occur. Among the reforms, the law requires proof of ID for those seeking absentee ballots and changes rules regarding campaigning near polls.

President Biden led a chorus of disapproval from the left in response to the law. At one point, Biden even referred to the measure as “Jim Crow on steroids” even though the bill actually expanded voting opportunities in most cases.

Regardless, MLB went ahead and moved the ASG to Colorado, a state which requires voter ID and actually has fewer early voting days than Georgia.

Wells had sharp words for Biden administration, who, he says, “has no idea what they’re doing.”

“I don’t watch baseball anymore, Brian,” Wells continued. “I refuse to watch it because of this. I don’t want no part of it, and this was my life … For me not to want to go to a baseball game or even watch, it kills me because I don’t put up with that kind of crap, and I don’t condone it.”

Wells’ disgust at the current “state-of-play” in the realm of sports and politics is not confined to MLB. The former World Series champion had harsh words for Nike and anthem protests as well.

“It’s [Kneeling for the national anthem is] disrespecting our flag, it’s disrespecting our military guys, and I don’t stand for it,” he said. “I grew up in San Diego, a military town, so to me, Nike — I took everything I had Nike, threw it in the trash. I got rid of it all. I don’t want it, I don’t condone these types of things … If I was playing right now, Brian, I would not wear that Nike. I would rip it off. I would cut a hole in my jersey and not have Nike on anything, and if I got suspended, so be it.”

Wells is a three-time All-Star and two-time World Series champion. He also threw a perfect game in May of 1998.",1
109,FNC’s Wallace: Kamala Harris May Not Want Her ‘Fingerprints’ on Border Crisis,"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace said Friday on “America’s Newsroom” that Vice President Kamala Harris knew the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is a mess.

For that reason, he argued, she may not “want her fingerprints on it.”

Wallace said, “It doesn’t seem that they have much of an answer to the crisis at the border. Maybe that’s the reason that they are not pushing it. And you know, it’s so interesting, because when the President first said that he was putting Kamala Harris, his vice president, in charge of the border, the sense was that he was putting her in charge of the border, the whole issue. And then a day or so later, the clarification came, well, no, she is not in charge of the border, she is in charge of diplomacy with Mexico and with the northern triangle countries to try to stem the flow to the border. She has had a couple of phone calls with top officials in those countries, but she hasn’t gone to the border, and she hasn’t gone to the northern triangle, and she hasn’t gone to Mexico, which kind of makes you wonder whether she knows this is a mess and doesn’t want her fingerprints on it.”

He added, “When you see these videos that you have just shown of the kids being dropped from the wall or that little boy deserted in the desert or more importantly the tremendous and terrible overcrowding of CBP facilities, 20,000 people in federal custody, 172,000 border stops in the month of March — I think we’re way past the point where you can even pretend this isn’t a crisis at the border. It is. It’s a humanitarian crisis. It’s an immigration national sovereignty crisis. There’s no two ways around it. The question is, what are you going to do about it.”

111,Half of Voters Say Biden Doing a 'Poor' Job of Handling Immigration Issues,"Half of U.S. likely voters say President Biden is doing a “poor” job of handling issues related to immigration, a Rasmussen Reports survey released Thursday found.

The survey, taken April 5-6 among 1,000 likely voters, asked respondents to rate Biden’s handling of issues related to immigration. Respondents could choose from “excellent,” “good,” “fair,” “poor,” or “not sure.” Of those surveyed, 50 percent chose “poor.” One-fifth, or 21 percent, said “good,” followed by “excellent” (14 percent), “fair” (11 percent), and “not sure (two percent).

Opinions appear to be sharply divided by party lines. A majority of Republicans and independent voters, 81 percent and 54 percent, respectively, said Biden is doing a poor job handling immigration-related issues. Democrat opinions are more positive, as 62 percent rate his handling of the issue as either excellent or good.

Per Rasmussen:

Biden’s ratings on immigration issues, however, are far worse than former President Trump’s. In July 2019, 34% of voters rated Trump excellent on his handling of immigration and another 12% said Trump was doing a good job on immigration.

The survey coincides with a rush on the Southern border, which GOP critics attribute to Biden rolling back key Trump-era policies, such as the Remain in Mexico policy, and restarting Catch and Release, which sees officials releasing illegal immigrants into the U.S. interior as they await their asylum hearings.

An AP-NORC poll released this week showed 72 percent of American adults identify illegal immigration as posing a “direct threat” to the United States.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is among Democrats who believe, despite the surge on the Southern border, that the U.S. is on a “good path at the border under the leadership of President Biden.”

“It’s about restructuring how we do what is happening there, because we were in a very bad situation under the Trump administration,” she said this week.

113,"Scalise Calls on Biden to ‘Reverse’ Immigration Policy — ‘He Created This, He Can End It’","During a Friday appearance on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria,” Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) urged President Joe Biden to reverse his immigration policy to solve the ongoing crisis at the border.

Scalise, who is visiting the border with a delegation of 10 members, described the situation at the border as “inhumane.” He asserted that Biden “created” this “scandal” because he put an end to former President Donald Trump’s Remain in Mexico policy.

“We were there less than an hour and saw dozens of people coming across the border, knowing that the door is wide-open because of President Biden’s new policy,” Scalise said. “This is something that President Biden created. He got rid of the … Remain in Mexico policy. It was a highly effective tool President Trump used to work with Mexico to keep people seeking asylum on the other side of the border in Mexico while they make those requests. Most of them are denied, by the way, but what is happening now is because they can just walk right across the border.”

He later added, “The drug cartels [are] running America’s southern border from Mexico. It is a national crisis. It is a scandal that was completely created by President Biden’s actions. He can reverse it, by the way. We are calling on President Biden to come down and see for himself; don’t … farm it out to Kamala Harris, who won’t come see it for herself. But he needs to reverse the policy. He created this. He can end it.”

115,State Department Torpedoes Migration Talks with El Salvador,"President Biden’s State Department derailed negotiations with El Salvador’s government on the migrant crisis by suggesting the country’s popular president is an authoritarian.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele this week refused to meet with Biden’s special envoy for the Northern Triangle, Ricardo Zúñiga, over what he described as personal affronts from Democrats and the United States administration, including calling him a dictator, two aides of the Central American leader told the Associated Press (AP).

The Northern Triangle is a Central American region that covers El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

The Salvadoran president told his aides “that he won’t meet with any Biden officials until the U.S. softens criticism raising doubts about his commitment to democracy and the rule of law, according to the two people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity given the diplomatic sensitivities,” AP noted.

Specifically, the two said comments made by State Department Spokesman Ned Price on Monday angered Bukele.

Echoing some Democrats who advised Biden not to meet with Bukele, Price declared:

We’ll also focus on preserving democratic standards, and we look forward to President Bukele to restore strong separation of powers where they’ve been eroded and demonstrate his government’s commitment to transparency and accountability to the people of El Salvador. We’ll continue to emphasize to political leaders the importance of appropriate democratic institutions as we partner with them.

Price also hinted the U.S. will work with local left-wing groups to pressure Bukele.

“Of course, we’ll also engage with civil society groups and to promote freedom of expression and, independent media, and the protection of journalists,” he noted. “Our goal in all of this is to create the conditions where the people of El Salvador can live healthy, successful lives and to thrive.”

Some of the so-called independent media in El Salvador is linked to the two establishment political parties that ruled El Salvador for decades before Bukele took office.

The Salvadoran press office and the country’s embassy in the U.S. capital did not respond to Breitbart News’s request for comment.

To the dismay of Democrats and their corporate media allies, Bukele enjoys a healthy approval rating of around 90 percent, namely for his fight against corrupt members of the two-party system that plagued El Salvador for decades.

AP acknowledged Bukele’s popularity among the Salvadoran public, which is partly based on his opposition to the easy-migration rules adopted by Biden that are pulling more young nationals from the Central American country up to the United States:

For all his combativeness, the 39-year-old Bukele is by far the most popular politician in Central America, a region plagued by corruption and criminality. His New Ideas party swept legislative elections by a landslide last month, and Bukele, who cultivates the image of a hip pragmatist, has sought to leverage China’s growing influence in the region to court new foreign investment.

Bukele’s refusal to meet with Zúñiga follows a similar snub he allegedly received when Biden turned down a meeting requested by the Salvadoran leader during an unannounced visit to the United States in February.

Zúñiga confirmed he was unable to meet with Bukele, blaming a potential scheduling conflict.

“Yes, we asked for the meeting, we did not receive it, I do not know how it was done,” he reportedly said.

Zúñiga asserted that he managed to communicate the important messages of the White House to the Central American country.

The envoy insisted on talking to Salvadoran officials about the importance of democracy and fighting corruption to reduce irregular migration.

Despite Bukele skipping the meeting with Biden’s envoy, his administration members met with the top U.S. diplomat and indicated they were willing to work with the Biden administration. The Salvadoran officials requested more development aid to keep Salvadorans from emigrating.

Bukele has said he favors “jumpstarting commerce” between the United States and El Salvador over foreign aid “handouts.”

“We are very willing to work with any initiative that aims to help,” Carolina Recinos, the coordinator of Bukele’s Cabinet, reportedly said.

In February, Biden declined to meet Bukele over Democrat criticism that the Salvadoran leader lacked respect for the rule of law and democracy, anonymous sources told AP.

It appears that Bukele’s biggest political sin was to work with former President Donald Trump on reducing illegal migration, prompting Democrats and the corporate media to paint him as a dictator who will erode democracy now that his New Ideas party won a substantial number of seats during the recent legislative body elections that could give him a supermajority via an alliance with a smaller party.

The State Department spokesperson’s remarks on Monday came in the wake of a spat between Bukele and one of his top U.S. critics, Rep. Norma Torres (D-CA), a Guatemala-born lawmaker who co-chairs the Central American caucus in Congress.

Via Twitter last week, Torres dismissed Bukele as a “narcissistic dictator” for allegedly being indifferent to the plight of Central American migrants who make the dangerous journey to the U.S.",1
117,Iowa Rep. Ashley Hinson Calls on Pelosi to Visit the Southern Border,"Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-IA) called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) to visit the border, saying Congress has been “kicking the can for far too long.”

The Iowa Congresswoman visited the Southern Border this week with other Republican members from the Republican Study Committee (RSC) to tour the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) facilities and hear from the law enforcement officers and border patrol that are being affected by the crisis happening at the southern border.

Hinson called out Pelosi for saying, “things at the border were moving in the right direction.” At the border, the Congresswoman tweeted, “today hearing from law enforcement who are saying otherwise. If she believes things are going well, the Speaker should come here & see the crisis I am seeing firsthand today.”

Yesterday, @SpeakerPelosi said things at the border were moving in the right direction. I’m at the border today hearing from law enforcement who are saying otherwise. If she believes things are going well, the Speaker should come here & see the crisis I am seeing firsthand today. pic.twitter.com/Juj0Wso157 — Ashley Hinson (@RepAshleyHinson) April 8, 2021

When the group of Republicans met with reporters, Hinson said, “we have to fix this, we have our work cut out for us,” adding that Congress has been “kicking the can for far too long.”

“My colleagues have asked for President [Joe] Biden and Vice President [Kamala] Harris to come here. Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi needs to come here too,” the Republican further reiterated, “just yesterday, she said that things are moving in the right direction.” She went on to say:

Well, we can tell you, we just sat down with law enforcement officials from all over this border community, and they are telling us otherwise. they’re telling us, their resources are strapped, there being outspent by cartels, and the cartels are changing their game faster than they can keep up.

I’m calling on @SpeakerPelosi to come see the crisis I’m seeing at the southern border today and talk to our law enforcement officers on the ground. This crisis is a safety and security issue for border communities and our communities in Iowa. It’s time to take action. #IA01 pic.twitter.com/qP6t16NM9r — Ashley Hinson (@RepAshleyHinson) April 8, 2021

Hinson said being an Iowa mom, everything that’s happening at the border is concerning to her. “This is a safety and security issue for our families, not only here on the border but across this country.”

The Republican claimed that cartel members are able to bring the drugs straight to Iowa from interstate-35, which goes straight through Iowa. She said this problem is “putting our communities at risk.”

“I’m very passionate about this issue. I’m ready to get to work on fixing these problems,” she said. Hinson serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the Homeland Security sub-committee in the House.

“So we’re ready to step up and make sure we can provide the resources necessary to fix this problem, but it doesn’t just stop with money. it starts with a change in policy, and we are committed and prepared to do that,” Hinson said.",1
119,"Duke of Edinburgh, Queen’s Consort Prince Philip Dies Age 99","The Queen’s consort Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, has passed away at the age of 99, news which shortly follows his return from a stay at King Edward VII’s Hospital in Marleybone, London.

A statement from Buckingham Palace said:

It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen has announced the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. Further announcement will be made in due course.

The Duke’s passing comes less than four weeks after he was photographed walking out of London’s King Edward VII’s Hospital in London, and just two months before his 100th birthday. Prince Philip had been in hospital for a heart complaint and had undergone surgery during the month-long visit. It was reported during his stay that he was not being treated in relation to coronavirus.

His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. pic.twitter.com/XOIDQqlFPn — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) April 9, 2021

Tributes have started to roll in for the Duke, including from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson who said:

He was the longest-serving consort in history, one of the last surviving people in this country to have served in the Second World War. At Cape Matapan, where he was mentioned in dispatches for bravery, and in the invasion of Sicily where he saved his ship by his quick thinking. From that conflict, he took an ethic of service that he applied throughout the unprecedented changes of the post-war era. Like the expert carriage driver that he was, he helped to steer the Royal Family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and the happiness of our national life… Speaking on their golden wedding anniversary, Her Majesty said that our country owed her husband a greater debt than he would ever claim or we should ever know. I’m sure that estimate is correct. So we mourn today with Her Majesty the Queen. We offer our condolences to her and to all her family and we give thanks as a nation and a kingdom to the extraordinary life and work of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.”

The Second World War veteran, who served with distinction as a Royal Navy officer in the Mediterranean and Pacific theatres, retired from his official duties only in 2017, well into his mid-nineties.

Born Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark and a speaker of many languages including Danish, French, German, and Greek, the royal gave up his Continental European titles and adopted the surname Mountbatten, from his British maternal grandparents, ahead of his 73-year marriage to the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947.

Just a few years later in 1952 Phillip’s father-in-law, King George VI, passed away at the young age of 56, causing his wife, 26, to ascend the throne.

Since then, the pair have become the longest-serving British monarch and consort in history — with Elizabeth, 94, now having to carry on without her partner seven decades, who she has previously described as “quite simply my strength and stay all these years”.

Known for his Laconic wit and a stoical if somewhat prickly attitude towards journalists — “media is a professional intruder, it wouldn’t work if it didn’t… so you can’t complain about it” he once told presenter Alan Titchmarsh — the Duke had a sense of humour which would be considered far from “woke” by the standards of some in the younger generations.

Media outlets long enjoyed compiling lists of his politically incorrect “gaffes” before his retirement from public life, including, for example, an occasion when he remarked to a British student who had gone trekking through Papua New Guinea: “So you managed not to get eaten, then?”

Perhaps his most lasting legacy will be his charitable work, however, with the Duke having served as Patron or President of over 800 charities during his years at the Queen’s side.

The best-known such enterprise is likely the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme, which has bestowed said award on over four million young people who have completed various endeavours including “physical, skills-based, and community challenges”.

121,"Delingpole: Finally, the Boss of Britain’s Wokest Police Force Steps Down","Andy Marsh, Chief Constable of Britain’s worst-policed region Avon and Somerset, is to step down after a disastrous year which put his department — and British policing in general — to shame.

Marsh’s police force was the one which last summer allowed a civic statue to be dragged from its plinth in Bristol by a mostly white mob claiming to represent Black Lives Matter. His officers stood back and watched — as ordered by their senior officer — as it was dumped in the city’s docks.

The superintendent in charge of the operation even went so far as to suggest that the city ‘should be proud’ over the act of vandalism because the statue belonged to a man linked to the slave trade.

Marsh said at the time his officers stood back because trying to stop a crime being committed at the protest would have caused “a very violent confrontation”. Inevitably, Bristol police gaining a reputation as being a force that stood back and watched crimes rather than stop them from happening had ramifications when Marsh was left over-correcting to prevent the city being burnt down.

Just months later, Marsh’s force was the one criticised for its response to the ‘Kill the Bill’ protests, which was characterised by a mix of ineptness, brutality, and mendacity.

The ineptitude included allowing the mob, including members of Antifa, to burn a number of police vehicles and cause ‘significant damage’ to the city’s New Bridewell police station.

The brutality comprised a heavy-handed overreaction in which police manhandled a news reporter and thuggishly batter fallen protestors with their riot shields.

Police assaulted me at the Bristol protest even though I told them I was from the press. I was respectfully observing what was happening and posed no threat to any of the officers. I have muted the latter part of the video to spare you all the pain of hearing my shrill voice. pic.twitter.com/a7a0Nnw0bG — Matthew Dresch (@MatthewDresch) March 27, 2021

The mendacity included a press statement by Avon and Somerset Police that among 20 injured officers ‘two of them were taken to hospital after suffering broken bones. One of them also suffered a punctured lung.’ This was untrue. The police subsequently retracted these false claims.

Avon and Somerset police’s failures represent in microcosm what is wrong with policing in Britain generally: insufferably woke, heavily politicised, inconsistent, untrustworthy, and once they actually get going extremely brutal towards those deemed enemies of the state.

Marsh, who joined Avon and Somerset police in 1987 and rose through the ranks to the top job, may only bear partial responsibility for this widespread culture of decline. But as the boss, he had to take the rap — especially after Home Secretary Priti Patel made clear her displeasure with Bristol’s lax policing, including with its slowness at bringing charges against the mob which pulled down the statue.

The statue of parliamentarian and city benefactor Edward Colston was pulled down in the summer at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests. Rather feebly, Marsh claimed that had his officers intervened it would have resulted in a ‘very violent confrontation.’ The more plausible explanation, however, is that local police were so institutionally woke they sympathised with the mob. Superintendent Andy Bennett, in charge of the operation that day, described Colston as “a historical figure who has caused the black community quite a lot of angst” and said “I do understand why it’s happened, it’s very symbolic.”

Bristol’s policing policy is a classic of example of ‘get woke, go broke.’

Marsh’s departure will, of course, do nothing to solve the problem which is endemic and long-term, the consequence of years of politically correct practice in which old-school officers have either retired or resigned in disgust, while the ranks (and especially the higher echelons) have been filled with officers more concerned with diversity quotas, rainbow-painted police vehicles and dancing at Gay Pride festivals than in dealing with actual crime.

Nor, sadly, will it remove perhaps the biggest problem with the police right now: their increasing deployment as the ruthless bully boys of Boris Johnson’s authoritarian Covid state. Just watch how the violence in Bristol by a hard-left mob will now be used to justify more heavy-handed tactics against peaceful protestors concerned about the erosion of their freedoms under lockdown tyranny.

Marsh is merely a symptom of a growing problem: the police are no longer the servants of the people but the un-British boot boys of an increasingly authoritarian state.",1
123,Failed Asylum Seeker Who Murdered and Mutilated Exeter Woman Jailed,"An Iraqi Kurd failed asylum seeker has been sentenced to at least 20 years in prison after being found guilty of murdering a woman, leaving her body to decompose in his flat for over a week as he dismembered and mutilated her remains before disposing of her.

Azam Mangori, 24, was found guilty of the brutal murder of 32-year-old Lorraine Cox last week. The migrant, who had traveled through Turkey, Greece, Germany, and France before arriving illegally in the UK in the back of a lorry, had suffocated Miss Cox with her own t-shirt in his flat above a kebab shop in Exeter, south-west England, in September 2020.

Passing sentence at Exeter Crown Court on Wednesday, Mr Justice Garnham said that when Mangori had seen Miss Cox walking home in the early hours of September 1s after a night out with friends, he intended to “pick her up” for sex, according to The Guardian.

After having sex at least once in the room above Bodrum Kebab House, the judge said that because Miss Cox was “hugely incapacitated by drink”, the Iraqi was able to push her top into her mouth and “suffocate her without significant opposition”.

The cour had also heard Mangori had hacked his victim’s social media accounts, pretending to be alive and well to her friends and family.

Mangori then spent the following week cutting up his victim’s body into pieces, wrapping most of the remains in black plastic bin liners before disposing of her limbs “unceremoniously” in the bins behind the kebab shop and burying her head and torso under bracken and branches outside of the city.

UK Deportations of Foreign Criminals Fell 79 per cent Last Year, Despite Patel’s Promises to ‘Get Tough’ https://t.co/5PazItcV8R — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 19, 2021

The judge told Mangori: “Rather than reporting her death to anyone, you kept her decomposing body in your bedroom for the next eight days.

“You purchased the necessary equipment from nearby shops and then set about cutting up her body with a view to disposing of it.

“You disarticulated her arms at the shoulder, her upper legs from her pelvis, and her lower legs from the knees.

“With the exception of her left lower leg and her kneecaps, you wrapped all her limbs in black plastic bin liners and dumped them unceremoniously in the waste bins behind the restaurant in anticipation of them being removed by council refuse collectors.

“Her lower left leg and kneecaps have never been recovered.”

He also mutilated her body, cutting at her forehead, and removing strips from her back and lower arm.

“The purpose of that mutilation is clear was to remove a tattoo which might have helped identify her. We can only guess at the purpose of the former mutilations,” Mr Justice Garnham said.

The BBC reported that Mangori had had his asylum application rejected in December 2018 — yet he was still in the country for almost two years before murdering Miss Cox.",1
125,Hotel Mogul Sir Richard Sutton Stabbed to Death in Dorset Home,"One of Britain’s wealthiest men, hotel mogul Sir Richard Sutton is dead after an attack inside his Dorset home.

Sir Richard Sutton and an as-yet unnamed female companion were attacked at Sutton’s home in Dorset. Sutton was declared dead at the scene, while the woman, thought to be his wife, was airlifted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. She remains in critical condition. Metro police said they arrested a 34-year-old suspect in the murder in Hammersmith after stopping his vehicle. Authorities believe the man and Sutton were acquainted prior to the attack.

Detective Inspector Simon Huxter released a statement saying “our thoughts are with the family of the man who sadly died and the injured woman at this extremely difficult time,” assuring the public “they are being supported by specially trained officers.”

“We will be carrying out a full investigation to establish exactly what happened at the address in Higher Langham,” Huxter continued, “and I would appeal to anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious in the area on the evening of April 7 to please contact us.” Huxter said their would be “heavy police presence” in the vicinity of the cordoned home, but “officers can be approached by members of the public with any information or concerns.”

Sir Richard Sutton Ltd. released a statement regarding the wealthy hotelier. “We are deeply saddened and devastated by the sudden death of Sir Richard Sutton, announced this morning,” they said. “Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family,” they added, continuing:

Sir Richard was passionately devoted to both his company and its people, setting the highest standards for quality in the hotel, farming and property interests within the group. His loss will be felt by everyone within the company, those who worked with him, and his family who have lost an incredible individual. Our thoughts are with the Sutton family at this tragic time.

North Dorset Conservative MP Simon Hoare said Sutton was a “charming man,” with a “very good sense of humor,” who he had known even before his time as an MP. “I knew him, strangely enough I knew him before I was an MP as my company did a lot of work for his estate many years ago,” he said. “He was a charming man, he had a very good sense of humour, he was politically astute and genial.”",1
127,Duke of Political Incorrectness: Prince Philip and the Queen in Pictures,"In the decades that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, acted as the Queen’s consort, he had always found ways to distinguish himself during royal visits.

Prince Philip was famed for his plain-speaking, as well as his witty and sometimes controversial remarks. He always sought to make those he spoke to, dignitaries and members of the public alike, to feel comfortable, sometimes making off-the-cuff or risque comments to show those he met they could stand easy.

When discussing tartan with the then-leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Annabel Goldies, at a papal reception in 2010, the Prince asked: “That’s a nice tie… Do you have any knickers in that material?”

Speaking to wealthy locals in the Cayman Islands in 1994, he asked them: “Aren’t most of you descended from pirates?”

Britain’s tabloid press often leapt upon these remarks, characterising them as “gaffes”, but the Duke’s enduring success as a senior working Royal was a testament to a success of the contextual humour enjoyed by those present — but perhaps not always understood by literally minded observers from afar.

During his more than six decades in service of the country, Prince Philip had become an expert at opening ceremonies, and sought ways to make the otherwise dry occasions interesting, such as during a visit to Canada in 1969, when he stated: “I declare this thing open, whatever it is.”

While at Hertfordshire University in 2003, opening a new campus which architecturally saw whole building sides open as giant windows the Duke of Edinburgh said: “During the Blitz, a lot of shops had their windows blown in and put up notices saying, ‘More open than usual’. I now declare this place more open than usual.”

The Duke was also famously down-to-earth, and was known to don a cap and drive his black cab in disguise through London.

But it seemed at times that his life was not as rustic as he may have liked, bemoaning in 1987: “I never see any home cooking – all I get is fancy stuff.”

“Bugger the table plan, give me my dinner!” he had said at a party in 2004.

And after a long day in 2000 after meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato, he rejected a glass of wine, saying: “I don’t care what kind it is, just get me a beer!”

He was also frank in matters of taste, saying of plans of his son Prince Andrew’s, the Duke of York’s, house in 1988: “It looks like a tart’s bedroom.”

Though also never afraid to make fun of himself, saying on turning 90 in 2011: “Bits are beginning to drop off.”

Prince Philip was a loving family man, and parallels have been drawn between the Duke and his only daughter Princess Anne for their dry wit and commitment to service. The Prince had said of his no-nonsense daughter’s love of horses in 1970: “If it doesn’t fart or eat hay, she isn’t interested.”

And of the 1974 IRA kidnap attempt made against his strong-willed daughter: “If the man had succeeded in abducting Anne, she would have given him a hell of a time while in captivity.”

Prince Philip was a devoted husband who deeply appreciated his wife, saying on marriage in 1997: “You can take it from me the Queen has the quality of tolerance in abundance.”

No matter how outrageous the remarks, the Duke of Edinburgh always managed to get away with it. Prince Philip said in 1956 of his mannerisms: “It’s my custom to say something flattering to begin with so I shall be excused if I put my foot in it later on.”

129,Just 0.1% of Irish Coronavirus Cases from Outdoor Exposure: Report,"Figures from Ireland’s Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) have revealed that just 0.1 per cent of the country’s total Wuhan coronavirus cases were linked to outdoor transmission.

The data claims that of the total 232,164 cases of the Wuhan coronavirus recorded in the Republic of Ireland by March 24th, just 262 were linked to transmission of the virus in an outdoor setting, or just 0.1 per cent of the total number of infections. In all, one-in-a-thousand cases of Coronavirus can be attributed to transmission out of doors.

According to a report from The Irish Times, which acquired the data after a formal request, there were 42 outbreaks linked to outdoor gatherings, with one outbreak resulting in seven cases. Construction site activity was linked to 21 outbreaks with 124 cases, and outdoor sports and fitness was linked to 20 outbreaks where there were 131 cases.

Prof Mike Weed of Canterbury Christ Church University in Kent, England, released a study on the outdoor transmission of coronavirus in September of last year, referenced by the Irish newspaper, which found “the outdoor environment presents a low risk of transmission of COVID-19 due to the natural social distancing that happens through the normal conventions of personal space in everyday life”.

The president of the Italian Society of Anti-infection Therapy (SITA) has criticized new laws mandating outdoor mask-wearing, insisting that these politically motivated maneuvers have “no scientific rationale.” https://t.co/wKBxo3NNid — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 4, 2020

“Our conclusion is that in many sectors, and for many sizes and formats, it should be possible to put appropriate evidence-based mitigations in place to deliver outdoor events and activities in a way that does not escalate the risk from sporadic transmission to cluster outbreak,” Professor Weed stated, according to The Irish Times.

The figures come after Dr Matteo Bassetti, a top epidemiologist in Italy, criticised his government’s move to require the wearing of masks in outdoor environments.

He said in October 2020: “The epidemiological trend offers no scientific basis for these measures.”

Adding: “In my opinion, prohibitions don’t do much; we need to focus on the involvement of the people, on correct information.”

Italy is not the only country to require the wearing of masks outdoors. Before the Easter holidays, the government of Vienna announced that high-traffic areas in the centre of the Austrian capital, such as the Stephanplatz square, would require the wearing of masks.",1
131,UK Govt Plays Down Claim Nation Is on Verge of Achieving Herd Immunity,"A University College London (UCL) model has claimed the UK will have herd immunity in a matter of days, but the health minister has rushed to pour water on the idea and encouraged the public to listen to the government instead.

The United Kingdom will have achieved herd immunity against coronavirus by Monday, academics from UCL claim in comments to Britain’s Daily Telegraph.

According to the university’s models, 73 per cent of people in the United Kingdom will have some form of immunity to coronavirus by Monday, which they say is enough to have herd immunity.

UK Govt Says Vaccine Certificates Will Be ‘Feature of Our Lives’, Passport for Pints Still on the Table https://t.co/RCTrwPnaUU — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 6, 2021

Professor Karl Friston, of UCL, told the newspaper:

The herd immunity estimates surprised me. However, they are unremarkable when one considers that over 50 per cent of adults have been vaccinated, around 42 per cent of people have now been exposed to the virus and about 10 per cet have pre-existing immunity. When factoring in the estimated efficacy of vaccination in terms of sterilising immunity, this – according to the model – means about 70 per cent of the population are immune. Based upon contact rates at the beginning of the pandemic and estimated transmission risk, this is nearly at the herd immunity threshold.

But the British government — which has recently been pleading with the public to keep obeying its strict lockdown rules, even as they start to relax as part of the government’s staggered ‘return to normality’ — dismissed the claims.

Health Minister Matt Hancock told LBC radio, in comments reported by The Times, that instead of listening to pronouncements by scientists, the public should keep following the government’s lockdown roadmap announced in February and recently updated.

He said: “I was told by some scientists that we were going to have herd immunity in May and then in June and then after that… What I prefer to do is watch the data. We’ve set out the roadmap, the roadmap is really clear. It is our route back to normal. We’re on track to meet the roadmap and that is our goal.”

Hancock continued that being too optimistic and acting normally before the government says it is safe to do so could cause coronavirus cases to rise again. He said: “I think we have taken the right course in plotting our way to freedom and doing it carefully because we want it to be irreversible. We have seen what happens when this virus gets going and we are seeing it getting going right now on the continent and other parts of the world — some of the scenes are really appalling.

“We want to get out of this safely and irreversibly and that’s why we set out the roadmap.”

NHS Is Too ‘Incompetent’ to Protect Vaccine Passport Data, Says Brexiteer David Davis https://t.co/flABqC0528 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2021

The government’s roadmap sees lockdown ending in four stages. The next stage will see outdoor venues like pub gardens reopen on Monday, with indoor drinking coming a month after that. In the summer, the government has said lockdown will end altogether and this should be “irreversible“.

Yet the mood music presently coming from Westminster makes it clear the long-anticipated end of lockdown could be anything but. While Boris Johnson has insisted there is no possibility of new vaccine passports being required for citizens to go shopping or visit a pub during lockdown phases two and three, the question of what will happen in phase four has been left quite clearly open.

Indeed, after the prime minister’s vague assurances, a government document was more explicit, making clear that access to public places could be barred later this year to those who do not hold the correct covid paperwork. As Breitbart London reported, it said: “It is possible that COVID-status certification could also play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently, for example in hospitality settings… For now, businesses should continue to plan to reopen in a way that follows the latest COVID-Secure guidance, and certification will not be required for reopening as part of step 2 or step 3.”

Regardless, as reported last week, the software required to roll out the government’s coronavirus status certification — a covid passport — may not be ready to deploy until the Autumn anyway, ready in time for the Winter.",1
133,Biden Adviser Richmond: Republicans Need to Stop Hiding Behind Second Amendment — It’s Not Meant for ‘Weapons of War’,"Biden senior adviser Cedric Richmond said Thursday on MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” that President Biden was determined to do “something about gun violence” so Republicans who “have hid behind the Second Amendment for far too long” need to respond to public demand for gun regulations on “weapons of war.”

Richmond said, “I know President Biden’s passion about doing something about gun violence and creating sensible gun laws along with Vice President Harris, and I think the country is shifting too.”

He continued, “Republicans and NRA have hid behind the Second Amendment for far too long. When the Second Amendment was written, people were stuffing gunpowder into a musket to shoot. Now you have guns that can shoot 100 rounds in a minute, and that’s just completely different. These are weapons of war. They’re weapons of mass destruction. They have no place on the streets of America. We have a president now who will call out all of those who oppose safe neighborhoods, safe streets, and stopping the carnage on the streets of America.”

Guest-host Nicolle Wallace said, “I say this with respect, Cedric, but have you met today’s Republican Party?”

Richmond said, “I have, but I think that the people in the country are more powerful than they’ve ever been and that the demand is there.”

He added, “Public support for sensible gun regulations up in the 80s, almost at 90%. For some things like universal background checks, it’s in the 90s. I think Republicans are either going to move with the times, or the voting population will move them out.”

He added, “The only industry in America, billion dollar industry, that can’t be sued, that is exempt from being sued, [is] gun manufacturers….This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued.”

The White House

The law protecting gun makers from frivolous lawsuits is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). Biden campaigned on repealing that act and removing the frivolous lawsuit protections that shield gun makers.

While campaigning in South Carolina on February 24, 2020, Biden criticized the PLCAA and then addressed gun makers by saying, “I’m going to take you down.”

During his Thursday comments from the Rose Garden, Biden made it clear that if he could only have one of his gun control actions proposed, it would one that ends frivolous lawsuit protections for gun manufacturers. He claimed the removal of said protections would create a “come to the Lord moment” for gun makers.

139,West Virginia AG Threatens to Sue Biden Admin over Gun Control EOs,"West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) has threatened to sue the Biden administration after President Joe Biden unveiled a series of gun control orders Thursday.

“Defending the Second Amendment remains one of the most important priorities for the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. I will not allow the far left to run roughshod over our citizens’ gun rights. If President Biden follows through on his proposals, we will be in court very quickly,” Morrisey said in a statement. “Gun violence and the senseless death attributed to it should pain all Americans, however, the evil acts of a select few should never be a catalyst for stripping the lawful masses of their constitutional rights, especially their right to self-defense and to bear arms.”

Earlier Thursday, Biden ordered the Department of Justice to write laws requiring background checks for homemade “ghost guns.” Additionally, the president requested the DOJ develop a model for “red flag” laws for states as a possible guideline. He also announced the nomination of gun control advocate David Chipman to head up the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).

“The idea is just bizarre to suggest some of the things we are recommending is contrary to the Constitution,” Biden said in his Rose Garden speech.

“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic,” the president continued, before calling the matter “an international embarrassment.”

“The job of any president is to protect the American people, whether Congress acts or not,” the president added. “I’m going to use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there’s much more that Congress can do to help that effort.”

Morrisey is not the only Republican attorney general who has signaled opposition to Biden’s gun control push. Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) pledged to protect Texans’ Second Amendment rights after Biden renewed his call for Congress to pass legislation aimed at banning “assault weapons” in the wake of the deadly Boulder, Colorado, grocery store shooting.

“Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa murdered 10 people in Boulder, CO. Biden immediately called for a ban on ‘assault weapons.’ Dems enthusiastically agree. Let me be clear: As long as I’m AG, the left will *never* be allowed infringe on Texans’ 2A rights,” Paxton tweeted at the time.",1
141,Verizon Recalls 2.5 Million Hotspot Devices Over Fire Hazard,"Verizon is recalling 2.5 million hotspot devices after discovering that the battery in the devices can overheat, creating a fire hazard.

CNBC reports that Verizon is recalling 2.5 million hotspot devices after discovering that the lithium-ion battery in the devices can overheat and create a fire hazard. The recall relates to Ellipsis Jetpack mobile hotspots imported by Franklin Wireless Corp and sold between April 2017 and March 2021.

Hotspot models labeled: MHS900L, MHS900LS, and MHS900LPP are all impacted by the fire hazard.

Verizon disclosed the recall on Thursday alongside a notice from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). A spokesperson for Verizon stated that just over 1 million of the recalled hotspots are currently in use.

The recall notice posted by the CPSC stated that Verizon received 15 reports of the hotspots overheating. Six of the reports included incidents of fire damage to bedding or flooring and two involved minor burn injuries to owners.

Some of the hotspots were supplied to students by their schools to assist them in remote learning as many schools continue online classes during the coronavirus pandemic. Parents who received the hotspots from the children’s schools are advised to contact the schools about receiving a replacement.

Other customers can request a replacement for their hotspots by visiting ellipsisjetpackrecall.expertinquiry.com or calling 855-205-2627.

The company has already issued a software update to powered-on hotspots that should help reduce the risk of overheating. The update prevents the hotspots from charging while powered on. Verizon also offered tips to avoid overheating including turning off devices when not in use, placing them on a flat, solid surface, ensuring they are not covered, and not exposing them to extreme temperatures.

Verizon said in a statement: “The safety of our customers is our highest priority. We are taking the situation very seriously, and we are working diligently to determine the cause of the issues with the supplier and to provide replacement devices for all of our customers, free of charge.”

143,Apple Developer: App Store Security Is Like Bringing ‘Plastic Butter Knife to a Gunfight’,"According to recently released legal documents, a senior Apple engineer compared the company’s App Store defenses against malicious actors to be like “bringing a plastic butter knight to a gunfight.” The senior employee also described the company’s review process for new apps as “more like the pretty lady who greets you… at the Hawaiian airport than the drug-sniffing dog.”

The Financial Times reports that as part of a recent lawsuit between Fortnite developer Epic Games Inc. and Apple, internal comments from a senior Apple developer about the company’s App Store security have been revealed.

Epic Games revealed in recent court documents that a senior Apple engineer compared the company’s App Store defenses against malicious actors and hackers to “bringing a plastic butter knife to a gunfight.”

The anecdote was cited by Epic Games in court documents and was based on internal documents quoting Eric Friedman, the head of Apple’s Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk unit.

Friedman also stated that Apple’s App Store review process for newly submitted apps was “more like the pretty lady who greets you… at the Hawaiian airport than the drug-sniffing dog.” Friedman was also quoted as saying that Apple was ill-equipped to “deflect sophisticated attackers.”

The comments from the senior Apple developer could hurt Apple’s case against Epic Games as the company argues that the 30 percent fee it charges on digital purchases within apps downloaded from the App Store is required to protect customers from malware and malicious apps.

Breitbart News recently reported that the iOS app developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who has previously called out Apple for its failure to properly police its app store and the prevalence of scam app across the platform, has filed a lawsuit against the hardware giant in California. Eleftheriou is accusing the company of exploiting its monopoly power over iOS apps “to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.”

Eleftheriou began highlighting the growing issue of scam apps available in the Apple App Store in February. Each of the scam apps Eleftheriou found appeared to use the same method including boosting their apparent legitimacy in the app store by purchasing fake reviews.

Eleftheriou is also of the developers of the Flesky keyboard app which was acquired by Pinterest, and Blind Type which was acquired by Google.

Eleftheriou alleges that after he reported that his FlickType app had been targeted by a scam clone, Apple failed to fix the issue while the scam app took away potential sales and negatively affected his App Store ranking.

145,Report: Facebook Has No Plans to Warn 500M Users Affected by Data Leak,"Social media giant Facebook has not notified more than 530 million users whose personal details were leaked due to a poorly-coded feature on the platform and recently made public, and has no plans to do so according to a company spokesperson.

A recent report from Reuters states that Facebook has not notified the more than 530 million users whose details were obtained due to one of Facebook’s own features and recently made public in an online database, and has no plans to do so.

Breitbart News recently reported that hackers published the phone numbers and personal data of 533 million Facebook users, including users’ full names, locations, phone numbers, and email addresses. Via Business Insider:

A user in a low level hacking forum on Saturday published the phone numbers and personal data of hundreds of millions of Facebook users for free online. The exposed data includes personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and — in some cases — email addresses. Insider reviewed a sample of the leaked data and verified several records by matching known Facebook users’ phone numbers with the IDs listed in the data set. We also verified records by testing email addresses from the data set in Facebook’s password reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user’s phone number.

A Facebook spokesperson told Reuters that the company is not confident it had full visibility on which users would need to be notified and also took into account that users could not fix the issue and the data was publicly available. Facebook claims that it fixed the bug that left the details vulnerable in the first place already.

Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, the European Union’s lead regulator for Facebook, stated that it contacted the company about the leak this week. It said it received “no proactive communication from Facebook” but has since been in contact with the company.

147,"EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Mexican Cartels Control the U.S. Border, Says Rep. Chip Roy","The ongoing immigration crisis is caused by Mexican cartels and the federal government is turning a blind eye, Texas Congressman Chip Roy argues.

“The most important thing for the American people to understand is that cartels control the border,” Congressman Roy said. “This administration is allowing it to happen, they are doing it in the name of illegal immigrants and is not compassionate to be forcing people to have to go through the chains of cartels to come to the United States.”

Breitbart Texas spoke with Congressman Roy during a series of border trips where he has been trying to learn from agents on the ground and, at times, migrants themselves about the realities of the immigration crisis. According to Roy, bad policy decisions followed by poor messaging from the Biden Administration triggered the latest surge. The Gulf Cartel and the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas have operational control of the border in their respective territories and are profiting since nothing crosses without their permission.

One of the most shocking revelations is that the vast majority of migrants who reach the Texas border have suffered through threats, extortion, abuse, kidnappings, rapes, and other types of horrors at the hands of cartels, he said.

“It’s horrific,” Roy said. “I understand people that want their children to have an opportunity in the United States–I mean who wouldn’t–I get it. But let’s also keep in mind what we are doing to our neighbors to the south.”

The current path is increasing the power of cartels in Mexico who are profiting immensely, while the country’s government is getting weaker, Roy said adding that the crisis is causing a labor and brain drain in Central America.

“We should be working to have a strong Western Hemisphere, where we have strong countries and neighbors to the south,” Roy said. “We should be improving the conditions of countries to the south by working with them rather than empowering cartels.”

149,Joe Biden’s Push on Gun Control Distracts from Historic Border Crisis,"President Joe Biden’s push for gun control Thursday distracted the media from new alarming numbers detailing the historic migrant crisis on the Southern border.

The president’s Rose Garden event highlighted the administration’s planned executive actions on gun control. The president also emphasized the dreams of gun control advocates, including a new assault rifle ban and reversing liability protections for gun manufacturers.

Biden’s gun control proposals were enough to distract reporters at the White House press briefing Thursday afternoon, who did not ask press secretary Jen Psaki a single question about the border crisis. There was also no mention of the record-breaking numbers of migrants apprehended at the border.

Agents apprehended nearly 170,000 migrants in March, a nearly 72 percent increase in a month. That included a record 18,663 unattended minors in a single month, more than twice the number apprehended in February.

Psaki ignored the crisis during the briefing, bringing in Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm to discuss President Biden’s dramatic spending proposals to increase green energy.

The White House has resisted commenting on the crisis after Biden insisted during a press conference in March that the rise in apprehensions were seasonal.

“It happens every single, solitary year: There is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of January, February, March. That happens every year,” Biden said.

The latest numbers, however, triggered corporate media fact-checkers to point out the administration’s messaging failure on the issue:

Well, I guess the Biden White House line that this is the usual annual migration surge at the border is no longer operative. pic.twitter.com/VNLIOZffsv — Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) April 8, 2021

Vice President Kamala Harris, despite taking charge of the “root causes” of the border crisis, has focused her travel domestically to promote the coronavirus vaccine and the administration’s proposed $2.5 trillion infrastructure spending plan.

On Wednesday, during the White House press briefing, Psaki declined to detail any trips to the border by the president or the vice president to draw attention to the issue.",1
151,"Cuomo's NY: Illegal Aliens to Get $15,600 in Taxpayer-Funded Checks","Nearly 200,000 eligible illegal aliens in New York could receive a one-time payment of $15,600 in taxpayer-funded benefits thanks to a budget deal approved by Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D).

This week, as Breitbart News reported, state Democrats and Cuomo struck a budget deal that shifts $2.1 billion in taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens who lost their jobs during the Chinese coronavirus crisis. The aid to illegal aliens is $1.1 billion more than tax credits and grants authorized for small businesses in the state.

Estimates now suggest about 187,000 illegal aliens are eligible for the benefits and each could receive a one-time payment of $15,600 or about $300 a week for the entire year.

Law360 broke down the figures:

Jobless workers may qualify for the full $15,600 payment if they show that they have filed a tax return within the past 3 years with a valid taxpayer identification number. The “Tier 1” relief amounts to a year’s worth of $300 weekly unemployment benefits, one-third less than New York’s current unemployment benefits, according to State Senator Jessica Ramos, D-Queens. Workers may also provide letters from their employer, paystubs and wage statements to try and access the Tier 1 payment. At a later point, the Commissioner of Labor will identify other forms of proof that workers may show to receive the full relief, according to the text of the bill. The fund will also free up a $3,200 payment — an amount equaling the combined three federal stimulus payments — to jobless workers who can’t provide the documentation for the higher payment, but who can prove their identity and state residency.

Despite supporting the budget deal, Cuomo has admitted he is concerned about the potential for fraud when illegal aliens begin applying for the one-time payments.

“Cuomo says the [New York State] Comptroller will examine excluded workers fund before it goes online, as well as [Attorney General] Tish James, for potential fraud vulnerabilities,” Zach Williams with City & State NY reported.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) said the benefits equate to taxpayer-funded subsidies for federal immigration violators:

Why are taxes high in New York? So the government can pay illegal immigrants up to $15,600. In New York, it pays to break the law. https://t.co/0BMLbxVQMm — Tom Cotton (@TomCottonAR) April 8, 2021

Open borders activists had been lobbying state lawmakers for months to include taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens in the budget. In one instance, illegal aliens eligible for the benefits went on a nearly month-long hunger strike, Breitbart News reported.

More than a million jobs have been lost in New York and an estimated 80,000 New York businesses may not make it to the end of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, mostly as a result of Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s (D) rigid economic lockdowns.

153,Buttigieg: ‘Eldercare’ Is Infrastructure that Makes Americans Thrive,"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Thursday on MSNBC’s “All In” that President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure package includes eldercare “because having that kind of infrastructure in place is part of what makes it possible for Americans to thrive.”

Hayes said, “Senator Marcia Blackburn of Tennessee tweeted that Biden’s proposal is about anything but infrastructure. $400 billion towards elder care. I was obviously horrified to think you would try to hoodwink Americans into support eldercare. Is that true?”

Buttigieg said, “So guilty as charged. We are supporting eldercare, caregiving economy, making it easier to age in place, and have community-based care because having that kind of infrastructure in place is part of what makes it possible for Americans to thrive. Again not sure why that’s being singled out given that it is something that the American people believe we ought to do, but as somebody who wants to put us on the spot defending that, that’s a job I’m happy to take up.”

155,Donald Trump Endorses Sen. Marco Rubio,"Former President Donald Trump formally endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who is up for reelection next year, describing the senator as a “tireless advocate for the people of Florida” and “all of the forgotten men and women of America.”

“It is my honor to give U.S. Senator Marco Rubio my Complete and Total Endorsement,” the 45th president said in a statement.

“Marco has been a tireless advocate for the people of Florida, fighting to cut taxes, supporting our Second Amendment, our Military and our Vets, a strong national defense, and all of the forgotten men and women of America,” he continued, praising the Florida senator for working with him throughout his presidency to reform the VA, help small businesses grow, and nix the debunked Trump-Russia collusion narrative Democrats vehemently pursued:

Marco worked with me to reform the VA and help our small businesses grow, and with his help, we achieved the lowest ever unemployment for women, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and almost all Americans. Together, we worked closely with the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, and have made great progress. He also ruled that “President Trump was in no way involved with Russia,” as he presided over the Senate Intelligence Committee on the FAKE Russia, Russia, Russia Hoax.

“Marco will never let the great people of Florida, or our Country, down!” Trump added.

The endorsement comes a long way from where the two stood during the contentious Republican primary prior to the 2016 election, which saw a bitter back and forth between the two candidates, as Trump commonly referred to the Florida senator as “Little Marco.” Trump ultimately trounced the Florida senator in the Sunshine State by double digits, triggering Rubio’s departure from the race. But throughout Trump’s presidency, the two appeared to establish a friendly working relationship.

“I am grateful for President Trump’s endorsement and his leadership on the major issues facing our nation, including the threat from China and the need to bring good jobs back to America,” Rubio said in a statement Friday following Trump’s endorsement.

“Democrats are trying to undo everything we accomplished over the past four years, but I will continue to fight for the forgotten men and women of this country and deliver results for hard-working Florida families,” he added.

At this point, Rubio is not expected to have any major Democrat challengers, although Florida Politics reported that “Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Winter Park has been polling her chances, building a campaign structure, and taking frequent shots at Rubio in recent weeks.”

In recent days, Rubio has slammed the emergence of “woke corporate hypocrites” such as Delta Air Lines, grilling the company after it expressed opposition to Georgia’s recent election law:

“Delta Air Lines is a business partner with the Chinese Communist Party, the same Chinese Communist Party that is committing genocide against Uighurs Muslims,” Rubio stated in a tweeted video:

Rubio doubled down in a letter to Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian, describing it as the “height of hypocrisy to claim Georgia’s revised election law is ‘unacceptable and does not match Delta’s values’ while you continue to partner with a government that is actively engaged in genocide.”",1

Biden said, “I really don’t know. And the fact of the matter is, it’s a red herring. It is absolutely a red herring. But I am absolutely, I think, within my rights to question anything that comes from the desk of Rudy Giuliani. And so, I don’t know is the answer.”

159,Trump DOD Chief Chris Miller Endorses Green Beret Vet Joe Kent in WA-3,"Former President Trump’s Defense Secretary, Christopher Miller, endorsed fellow Green Beret veteran Joe Kent (R) for Washington’s third congressional district seat on Wednesday.

Miller, who served as Kent’s battalion commander in Iraq in 2006 and 2007 at the height of the violence, said in a statement:

Joe Kent has my complete and total support. I have been in combat with Joe Kent. In combat, a person’s true character is revealed. The only things that matter are honor, endurance, selfless service, and empathy. No one I know better exemplifies those virtues.

Joe served in the Army for twenty years, serving in the special forces. During his eleven combat deployments overseas, Joe saw first-hand the threats we face as a nation. After retiring from the Army, Joe worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.

Miller also noted that Kent is a Gold Star spouse who lost his wife, Navy Chief Petty Officer Shannon Kent, to terrorists in Syria in 2019:

After his wife, a fellow special operator, was killed by ISIS terrorists in Syria, Joe returned home to the Pacific Northwest to raise his sons. He saw first-hand the threats our country faces at home. While our Republic was under threat, Joe served in an advisory role to the Trump Administration on national security. I know Joe personally and can say without hesitation that we need Joe Kent in Congress.

Miller added:

Of all the candidates running in the Third Congressional District, Joe is the only qualified, prepared, and battle-tested candidate. He’s a constitutional conservative, an ally of President Trump, and will always represent those he is elected to serve. I’m humbled and honored to endorse such a great Soldier, Father, and widower who has sacrificed for our United States to a degree that leaves me breathless and feeling unworthy. I ask that you join me in supporting Joe Kent for Congress.

Kent, who announced his run after incumbent Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-WA) voted to impeach Trump, said in a statement:

Throughout his military career and in the Trump Administration, Secretary Miller represented our Armed Forces with distinction and courage. I am honored to receive Secretary Miller’s endorsement and look forward to earning the support of the voters in the Third District in the same way: through hard work and dedication to our Constitutional, Republican values.

Kent said in an interview with Breitbart News on Thursday that Miller’s endorsement meant a lot, since he was a former commander as well as a well-respected leader in the Special Operations Forces community.

“I always had a lot of respect for him, and was proud to serve underneath him,” Kent said. “In retirement he went over and worked in the National Counterterrorism Center, and so those of us who had worked under him thought, ‘That’s pretty cool, he’s still in the fight after retirement.'”

“He’s not a politician. He retired as a colonel — he wasn’t a Pentagon general type of guy. And then he’s a very outside the box, non-traditional thinker.”

“When I found out he wanted to endorse me, I was pretty humbled and honored…I say all the time getting hit up by old teammates or guys I worked with and them saying they support what I’m doing is like really the best endorsement I can get, so he’s kind of like the pinnacle of that,” he said.

Kent, who is running on America First policies, favors withdrawing U.S. troops from the Middle East — something he is pessimistic President Joe Biden will do, given his record over four decades in Washington, as well as in the Obama administration.

“He famously said we’re going to be out of Afghanistan by 2014, so his track record is terrible,” Kent said, adding that Biden will likely not adhere to the Trump administration’s May 1st troop withdrawal date because it would signal that Trump was on the right track.

Kent said Biden and his foreign policy team are “deeply invested” in the idea that U.S. troops need to be in Afghanistan, as well as in Iraq and Syria. Yet, he said, at the same time, the Biden administration wants to lift economic sanctions on Iran, which would lead to its proxies having more money to target the U.S. forces that are in the Middle East.

“They’re wed to this narrative that the more grace we show Iran in the form of sanctions relief, the more cooperative they’ll become — but really, more sanctions relief equals more money in the hands of Iran’s proxies, and that’s their biggest weapon, and if we’re going to leave our troops in the battlefield in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria, that just gives the proxies who just got more money from the sanctions relief more ability to strike our guys.

“I just overall think the foreign policy is headed in a very dangerous direction,” he said.

161,GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy Raises Record $27 Million for House GOP,"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-CA) announced a record haul of campaign contributions Thursday night, showing he raised over $27 million.

McCarthy single-handedly raked in a massive amount of campaign cash to take back the House from Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) socialist and partisan agenda.

McCarthy was able to raise $27.1 million in the first three months (January to March) of 2021 from 50,000 donors. It is the most money any Republican representative has ever raised in a quarter, according to the Wall Street Journal.

McCarthy was also able to raise this much money with only about $450 thousand coming from PAC money, which means less than about two percent came from corporate political action committees. This also shows that each donation averages less than $540.

To show some perspective on how much was raised this quarter, McCarthy raised about $100 million throughout the last two-year cycle. This is an average of $12.5 a quarter.

In the recent months after the January 6th riot at the Capitol, corporate PACs put a freeze on money going to Republicans. The amount of money raised by McCarthy without PAC money shows Republicans are not reliant on their donations anymore. This could lead to a new era of GOP fundraising.

While many of the American corporations have stayed clear of giving campaign dollars to Republicans, the very same corporations have played politics themselves. Corporations like Delta Airlines, Coca-Cola, and even Major League Baseball (MLB) have become involved in partisan politics.

After Georgia passed a voter integrity bill, Delta’s CEO gave a statement condemning the legislature to pass such a bill. Coca-Cola’s CEO did as well. MLB also used this opportunity to make a statement by moving their All-Star Game out of Atlanta, Georgia. Republicans have seized the moment to make an example out of these corporations and show Republicans are not beholden to corporate money.

McCarthy came close to flipping the House in 2020, having come within five seats of Pelosi’s majority. Going into the midterm elections, McCarthy will have to flip those seats while keeping the seats he already has.

Recently, McCarthy was in Iowa to rally support for Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA) with a day full of public events, helping her save her seat from Pelosi. Pelosi tried “stealing” Miller-Meeks’ seat from a state-certified election in an attempt to add ranks to her slim majority.

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) also announced Thursday that it raked in a massive $33.7 million in the first three months of the year as they gear up to help McCarthy take back the majority in the House.

The NRCC has also started mounting an attack on vulnerable Democrat seats they are looking to flip. Recently, the campaign released attack ads on the vulnerable incumbents.",1

Roy said, “[T]he JCPOA, the agreement that they want to go back to, was not working, was not going to work. It only empowers and appeases Iran. It does nothing to hold their feet to the fire and keep our interests aligned with Israel, which is what our goal ought to be and should be. But instead, it’s all about appeasing Iran. … Now Biden is attacking American citizens in Georgia for wanting to have election rules that make some sense.”

165,China Warns Turkey to Silence ‘Anti-Communists’ on Uyghur Genocide,"Beijing urged Ankara on Wednesday to “stay vigilant” against Turkish “nationalist and anti-communist” factions critical of China’s genocide of Turkic Uyghur minorities in the western Chinese territory of Xinjiang.

Turkish opposition leaders Meral Aksener, head of the nationalist Good Party (IYI), and Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas of the left-wing Republican People’s Party (CHP) recently released Twitter statements recalling “the 1990 killing of Uyghurs by Chinese forces in the Baren Township [of Xinjiang],” Turkey’s Hurriyet newspaper reported this week.

The Turkish opposition leaders “called China’s dealing of the 1990 Baren riot ‘persecution,’ and the riots which brutally killed police and kidnapped others as ‘martyrdom,'” according to China’s state-run Global Times.

The Baren incident preceded what human rights activists and multiple governments, including the United States, consider a genocide against Uyghur people in Xinjiang, fueled by the maintenance of hundreds of concentration camps where survivors say prisoners endure severe torture, rape, and killings.

The Chinese Embassy in Turkey responded to the politicians’ criticism of China’s actions toward Uyghurs in Xinjiang with the following Twitter statement on April 6:

The Chinese side resolutely opposes and strongly condemns any challenge by any person or power to China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese side reserves the right to a rightful response. The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region is an integral part of Chinese territory. This is an internationally accepted and indisputable fact.

The Turkish Foreign Ministry summoned China’s ambassador to Turkey, Liu Shaobin, on April 6 to express “discomfort” over the Twitter statement, according to Hurriyet.

“I personally do not think that either of the people who defended the Baren riot knew what really happened in Baren,” Erkin Oncan, an Istanbul-based journalist specializing in extremist movements in China and the Middle East, told the Global Times on April 7, referring to Meral Aksener and Ankara Mayor Mansur Yavas.

“[I]t is no coincidence that the two names that commemorate the Baren riots were representatives of the well-known nationalist and anti-communist political movements in Turkey,” Oncan added. ” On the other hand, Aksener and her party’s support to separatists from China’s Xinjiang is widely known.”

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhao Lijian called the Chinese Embassy’s response to Aksener and Yavas’s criticism of China “completely justified and beyond reproach” when asked to comment on the incident by Reuters at a regular press conference on April 7:

After certain individuals in Turkey blatantly endorsed terrorists on Twitter, challenged China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, and even made erroneous comments openly inciting splitting China, the Chinese Embassy in Turkey stated China’s solemn position at the earliest time. Its response is completely justified, reasonable and beyond reproach. Turkey itself has long been plagued by terrorism and separatist forces. We hope people from all walks of life in Turkey could look at China’s firm position to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as its counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts in a rational and objective light, and join China in upholding the overall picture of China-Turkey strategic cooperative relations with concrete actions.

An estimated 50,000 Uyghur refugees reside in Turkey. Observers have traditionally viewed Turkey, a majority Sunni Muslim country, as a clear ally for the Uyghurs, who speak a Turkic language and are also majority Sunni. Despite the cultural links, Turkey has waffled in its support of Xinjiang’s Uyghurs in recent years as Ankara seeks to maintain economic and trade ties with China, which was Turkey’s first trade partner in East Asia and second import partner after Russia in 2019.",1
167,Biden Can’t Boycott Olympics Because Coca-Cola Is a Sponsor,"Chinese officials and state media on Wednesday warned the Biden administration not to boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics over human rights complaints, claiming such a boycott would “damage the spirit of the Olympic Charter” and inflict severe economic and political damage on the weakened United States.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian claimed allegations of Chinese abuses against Tibet, Hong Kong, and the Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang province are false and warned of a “robust Chinese response” to any boycott.

“The politicization of sports will damage the spirit of the Olympic Charter and the interests of athletes from all countries. The international community, including the U.S. Olympic Committee, will not accept it,” Zhao said.

China’s state-run Global Times instructed the Biden administration to ignore “anti-China hawks” who are trying to pressure Western governments into boycotting the Olympics, and crowed that the United States no longer has the economic strength or prestige to lead a boycott movement.

After quoting “Chinese experts” who dismissed all human rights allegations against Beijing as “stigmatization” and “lies,” and predicted fickle activists would soon get tired of fighting the Chinese Communist Party’s diplomatic and propaganda counter-offensive, the Global Times said no one would risk alienating China and losing access to its “rising market for winter sports products.”

The Global Times approvingly cited a Newsweek article by Johns Hopkins professor David Lampton that argued China has grown too powerful to embarrass or punish with sanctions:

“Given the modern realities of Chinese global economic integration, today we can expect much more resistance to the boycott idea. Washington could well find itself the majorette for a marching band that is going in an entirely different direction,” he wrote. In 2008, anti-China forces like some Western politicians and Tibet separatists tried to play the same trick to boycott the Beijing Olympics, but eventually, they failed. “Most major states will participate in the 2022 Winter Olympics … One key difference between now and 2008 is that today’s China feels much stronger diplomatically and economically than it did more than a decade ago,” wrote Lampton.

The Global Times described the Biden administration as “cautious” about the Beijing Olympics, but “confused” would be a better term. As the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) noted, the administration went from floating the idea of a boycott to denying it had ever discussed the possibility in a span of hours on Tuesday.

Another Global Times editorial on Wednesday derided “ridiculous notions and ideas” from Western politicians, such as “skipping the event, including changing the venue, asking athletes not to attend the event, calling on media distributor NBC Universal not to air the games, and pressuring businesses from sponsoring the event.”

The Communist paper sneered that American corporations are in no shape to join a boycott that could cost them billions by locking them out of Chinese markets:

Beyond the potential impact on the sports world, the radical calls are also causing burden on global businesses, which could result in heavy economic losses. Olympic sponsors, including Coca-Cola, Visa, General Electric and other multinational corporations, which count on the Winter Olympics to gain greater market share in the massive Chinese market, are now caught in the crossfire. According to media reports, some anti-China forces have started harassing these sponsors “one by one”. Last month, a public letter asked Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky to withdraw its Olympic sponsorship or risk reputational damage. A similar letter has also been reportedly sent to Mars Wrigley CEO Grant Reid. As these Western forces try to use Xinjiang-related affairs to further intensify the division and confrontation between China and the West, they create huge risks to economic and trade cooperation as well as foreign companies’ businesses in China. Some have already warned that if Western companies bow to the pressure and decide to boycott the Beijing Olympics, they could face serious consequences in the Chinese market.

The Global Times pointed to recent Chinese boycotts against Western companies that dared to criticize forced labor in Xinjiang province as an example of China successfully using its economic power to control foreign corporations – phrased, of course, as a “widespread backlash from the Chinese public” against apparel brands that refused to buy Xinjiang cotton due to “lies” about forced labor.

The Global Times warned:

With more than 10 months to go before the 2022 Olympics, anti-China forces will likely continue their boycott plot with endless slandering and smearing. But responsible countries and companies should keep sober and not to be carried away. Politicizing sports and commercial cooperation will only lead to ruinous consequences for all.

The problem facing President Joe Biden is he claims his predecessor Donald Trump’s approach to China was wrong, and he can build better diplomatic and economic relations with the CCP. However, he also claims he will relentlessly badger the Chinese about human rights and as the Chinese made very clear in their fiery Alaska confrontation with Biden officials, they will not accept even tepid or purely rhetorical human rights criticism from Biden.

The bungled boycott messaging from Biden officials on Tuesday that prompted China’s threats and commands was, according to the WSJ, mostly about discussions of a possible “diplomatic boycott,” which means the U.S. would fully participate in the Beijing Olympics but would refrain from sending high-level officials to observe the event. Another idea floated by Congress is to require all American competitors to receive a briefing on China’s human rights abuses and the risks its surveillance-obsessed regime poses to their personal security while they attend the Games.",1
169,TikTok Blacklists PragerU,"Non-profit organization PragerU, founded by radio host Dennis Prager to produce short informative videos on conservative topics, has been permanently blacklisted from Chinese-owned social media app TikTok.

“Tik Tok has permanently banned PragerU from its platform for ‘multiple violations’ of their community guidelines,” PragerU wrote in a tweet on Thursday. “This is blatant censorship.” The organization started a petition over TikTok’s blacklisting.

🚨CENSORSHIP🚨 Tik Tok has permanently banned PragerU from its platform for ""multiple violations"" of their community guidelines. This is blatant censorship.

Sign and share the petition to help PragerU fight back against Big Tech censorship! 👉 https://t.co/qBACSybaB9 pic.twitter.com/PLI7xNOP5X — PragerU (@prageru) April 8, 2021

TikTok is the latest tech platform to censor PragerU, as the group has faced censorship from several platforms including Facebook, Spotify, and YouTube.

Last year, Facebook buried PragerU’s page and “reduced distribution” of its posts claiming that the group has engaged in “repeated sharing of false news.” The decision came after a fact check of a PragerU video about polar bears by Facebook third-party fact-checker Climate Feedback.

Breitbart News also reported in 2018 that Facebook claimed that a 99.9999 percent drop in engagement on PragerU’s page was the result of an “employee error.”

In 2019, Spotify banned advertisements from PragerU on its platform, writing an email to the conservative group stating that “the content of the ads do not comply with our editorial policies.”

“On further review of your website, there are additional compliance concerns with the content of the site which listeners of the ads are directed to,” Spotify added. “Our policy team has made the decision to stop all existing ads and not approve any new ads coming through in the future.”

Google-owned YouTube has also censored PragerU, placing 80 of their 400 videos are on a “restricted list,” according to the organization’s founder.

The restricted mode feature is used in order to block videos that have been deemed inappropriate, such as pornography or violence.

PragerU filed a lawsuit against YouTube and its parent Google in 2017 over alleged censorship of their videos.

171,Report: Twitter Held Discussions to Swallow Up Clubhouse for $4 Billon,"Social media giant Twitter reportedly held talks in recent months to acquire the popular startup app Clubhouse for $4 billion, which is touted as an audio-based social media network and has received significant attention for its chat sessions featuring the leading lights of Silicon Valley.

A recent report from Bloomberg states that Twitter held talks in recent months to acquire the popular audio-based social network Clubhouse. The companies reportedly discussed a potential valuation of around $4 billion for Clubhouse, according to sources who wished to remain anonymous.

Discussions for Twitter to purchase the app are allegedly no longer ongoing and it is unclear why negotiations broke down. A Twitter spokesperson declined Bloomberg’s request for comment. Bloomberg News reported just earlier this week that Clubhouse was in talks to raise funding from investors in a round valuing the business at about $4 billion.

After discussions with Twitter broke down, Clubhouse began exploring whether it made sense to raise financing at that valuation. The app allows users to host audio chat rooms where people can join in to listen or discuss various topics. The Masters of the Universe including Mark Zuckerberg have virtually held court using the app to discuss the future of technology.

Despite being barely a year old, Clubhouse has attracted some of the biggest names in business and Hollywood to the platform and multiple existing tech firms have begun development of apps with similar features to Clubhouse, including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Slack.

Twitter’s Clubhouse competitor Spaces launched in late 2020 and is still currently in beta form, but Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey seems to believe that audio interaction could be a big area of growth for Twitter in the future.

It has also recently been reported that Microsoft is in talks to purchase the gaming-focused chat community Discord for more than $10 billion. Discord is known for its free service allowing gamers to communicate by video, voice, and text. During the pandemic, the software has increasingly been used for study groups, dance classes, book clubs, and other virtual gatherings.

173,Amazon’s Twitch Now Penalizes Users for Offline Activity,"Amazon-owned video streaming platform Twitch has unveiled a new policy of penalizing users based on their conduct off-platform as well as on-platform, creating a virtue test for any user wishing to use the popular streaming service.

The offline behaviors that Twitch will penalize include “membership in a known hate group.”

Via Twitch’s official blog:

Our current guidelines state that in some serious cases where there is available, verifiable evidence, we may take action against users for hateful conduct or harassment that occurs off Twitch services—meaning on social media, other online services, or even offline—when directed at members of the Twitch community. We are updating and expanding our approach to off-service enforcement, which now falls into two categories: Category one: Someone is harassed on Twitch, as well as off Twitch. When this happens, we will take into account verifiable, off-service behaviors or statements that relate to an incident that took place on Twitch. For example: if we’re reviewing a harassment report about an incident that happened live on stream, related or continued harassment on Twitter could be taken into account when reported to us. This is how our current off-service policy works in the vast majority of cases, and will not change. Category two: We will now enforce against serious offenses that pose a substantial safety risk to the Twitch community, even if these actions occur entirely off Twitch. Examples of these behaviors include: Deadly violence and violent extremism

Terrorist activities or recruiting

Explicit and/or credible threats of mass violence (i.e. threats against a group of people, event, or location where people would gather).

Leadership or membership in a known hate group

Carrying out or acting as an accomplice to non-consensual sexual activities and/or sexual assault

Sexual exploitation of children, such as child grooming and solicitation/distribution of underage sexual materials

Actions that would directly and explicitly compromise the physical safety of the Twitch community, such as threatening violence at a Twitch event

Explicit and/or credible threats against Twitch, including Twitch staff These behaviors represent some of the most egregious types of physical and psychological harm, but we understand that this list is not inclusive of all types of harassment and abuse.

In the past, when tech platforms have created policies aimed at combating “hate” or calls for real-world violence, these policies have been enforced selectively.

For example, numerous accounts used Twitter to identify looting targets during the summer riots, and were faced with scant crackdowns despite the platform being alerted to the tweets. Rose City Antifa, the Portland-based Antifa chapter at the center of over a hundred days of insurrection in the Democrat-controlled city, continues to be allowed a Facebook page with over 20,000 likes.",1
175,Twitter Forbids Trump Tweet Archive Account on Platform,"Twitter will not allow an archive of former President Donald Trump’s account on its platform. The Masters of the Universe stated: “Given that we permanently suspended @realDonaldTrump, the content from the account will not appear on Twitter as it did previously or as archived administration accounts do currently.”

The Hill reports that Twitter has forbid an account that archived posts from the account of Former President Donald Trump on its platform. A Twitter spokesperson told the Hill that the platform has been working with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to preserve tweets from the account, as they have done with previous government Twitter accounts.

But, Twitter has stated that content from the account will not be allowed to appear on the platform itself. A Twitter spokesperson told the Hill:

Given that we permanently suspended @realDonaldTrump, the content from the account will not appear on Twitter as it did previously or as archived administration accounts do currently, regardless of how NARA decides to display the data it has preserved Administration accounts that are archived on the service are accounts that were not in violation of the Twitter Rules.

NARA has archived multiple former Trump administration accounts including Trump’s @POTUS45 account, former First Lady Melania Trump’s @FLOTUS45, and former Vice President Mike Pence’s @VP45 account.

Twitter permanently suspended the @RealDonaldTrump account on January 8, stating that the former President’s tweets relating to protests at the U.S. Capitol violated the platform’s glorification of violence policy.

NARA told The Hill that it intends to preserve all presidential records on social media, including tweets that have been blocked or deleted. In a statement, the agency said:

NARA works closely with Twitter and other social media platforms to maintain archived social accounts from each presidential administration, but ultimately the platform owners can decline to host these accounts. NARA preserves platform independent copies of social media records and is working to make that content available to the public.

177,Judge Imposes Permanent Ban on Release of Undercover Videos of Abortion Conferences,"A United States District judge imposed a permanent ban on the release of undercover investigative videos that contain recordings of National Abortion Federation (NAF) conferences.

Judge William H. Orrick III’s order declared David Daleiden, project lead at the Center for Medical Progress (CMP), to be in breach of contract with the abortion provider group for recording their conferences and also imposed upon the video journalist a permanent injunction that blocks him from ever releasing hundreds of hours of recordings from those conferences.

“NAF contends these are irreparable injuries that are not adequately addressed through remedies at law and that justify permanent injunctive relief,” Orrick wrote. “I agree.”

Orrick also dismissed CMP’s argument that its undercover recording of NAF conferences produced information that was in the public’s interest:

The public interest also weighs in favor of permanent, injunctive relief. Defendants argue to the contrary by pointing to the various federal, state, and local investigations that their HCP videos prompted, resulting in investigations, prosecutions, and regulatory terminations and guidance. Defendants do not, however, identify any NAF Materials specifically identified by or relied on by those entities that led directly to any of the prosecutions or regulatory actions. Defendants also neglect to mention that my personal review of the NAF recordings (those identified by defendants that, in their view, showed NAF members willing to engage in or admitting to illegal conduct) and other information defendants secured at the 2014 and 2015 NAF Annual Meetings, disclosed no criminal activity.

Daleiden had previously exposed the alleged sale of aborted fetal organs and body parts between Planned Parenthood and others in the biomedical research industry. He tweeted regarding NAF’s desire to keep the videos hidden from public view:

What's on the footage from abortion industry tradeshows that @PPFA leaders are so desperate to cover up? Maybe it has something to do with the baby parts companies sponsoring the tradeshow? Maybe with our expert who says the convos show infanticide? The truth must be revealed. https://t.co/A4G3AvuWFZ — David Daleiden (@daviddaleiden) April 8, 2021

The CEO of the abortion providers group is Episcopal priest Very Rev. Dr. Katherine Hancock Ragsdale.

“This permanent injunction is incredibly important to the safety and security of our members,” she said in a statement, adding:

Without a permanent injunction, there is no question that David Daleiden would continue releasing footage from our meetings, which would result in cycles of harassment and violence against NAF, our members, and other abortion providers as we have seen repeatedly and consistently happen with each video release since 2015.

NAF continued that “Daleiden and his co-conspirators are the ones who broke the law, not abortion providers.”

However, attorneys at the Thomas More Society, who represent Daleiden, said in a press statement they will appeal Orrick’s order which, they argue, violates Daleiden’s First Amendment rights.

Thomas More Society Vice President and Senior Counsel Peter Breen said in a statement:

This permanent injunction covering up the release of incriminating video from a large abortion trade show strikes at the heart of the First Amendment. The American people deserve to see and hear what the abortion providers of this country are willing to say and do to skirt and even violate the law. We will appeal this decision, to vindicate David Daleiden’s rights and the rights of every brave undercover journalist in this country and to hold bad actors like the National Abortion Federation to account.

The case is National Abortion Federation v. Center for Medical Progress, No. 15-cv-03522-WHO in U.S. District Court Northern District of California.",1
179,"Manchin: Parts of GA Law ‘Atrocious,’ But There Shouldn’t Be Federal Overreach Into Elections and ‘I’m Not Killing the Filibuster’","During an interview with CNN on Thursday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) stated that he won’t eliminate the filibuster, and while he thinks Georgia has some provisions in their election law that he strongly dislikes and supports certain “guardrails” on elections, “I don’t think there should be an overreaching” by the federal government.

Manchin said, “I’m not killing the filibuster. I’ve been very, very clear. … We should have an open, fair, and secure election. If we have to put guardrails on, we can put guardrails on so people can’t take advantage of people.”

He also stated, “We want fair, open, secured elections. And what — Georgia has done some things which I thought were just atrocious, okay? But [I’ve] also been a secretary of state and I’ve been a governor, and I know the 10th Amendment. I know my rights as far as states’ rights, and I don’t think there should be an overreaching, if you will, federal elections.”

Manchin said one specific problem he has with Georgia’s law is that “they took away the powers of the secretary of state’s office and put it in the hands of…their legislature.”

But doing both, she suggested, is an impossibility.

“We can preserve the filibuster, or we can preserve the voting rights of people of color. But we can’t do both,” Clinton said, providing a CNN graphic of the United States which identified bills “aiming to curb voting rights introduced in almost every state”:

We can preserve the filibuster, or we can preserve the voting rights of people of color. But we can't do both. pic.twitter.com/TFvfe7vEKs — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) April 8, 2021

Clinton’s remark follows a wave of leftist rage stemming from Georgia’s recently signed election integrity law, which, despite popular belief, expands voting in some areas:

Nearly 30% of Georgia’s voters are Black. And Republicans passed a voter suppression law targeting them…. https://t.co/q1Sa0s4WZt — Jaime Harrison, DNC Chair (@harrisonjaime) April 6, 2021

More than 350 voter suppression bills have been introduced this year. We are seeing a coordinated assault on our democracy and the Senate must act to protect voting rights. — Reverend Raphael Warnock (@ReverendWarnock) April 6, 2021

Members of the radical left quickly dismissed the legislation as suppressive, prompting Major League Baseball’s (MLB) decision to pull its All-Star Game and draft from Atlanta, a city with a sizeable minority population.

According to Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, Commissioner Rob Manfred opted to pull the events from the state after speaking with failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, a point of interest given Abrams’ aversion to the early boycotts of the Peach State:

SCOOP: @MLB sources say owners were blindsided at least by the timing of @RobManfred's decision to pull the All-Star game from Atlanta. Also said his decision came after speaking w @staceyabrams, which is odd since she has now said she's against the boycott. Story developing — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) April 7, 2021

What doesnt add up about @staceyabrams criticism of moving All-Star game out of Atlanta: She was initially partnering w @KingJames organization @morethanavote to oppose GA voter law. @morethanavote supports MLB decision to move out of Atl. Has she relayed her concerns to LeBron? — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) April 7, 2021

Notably, the MLB moved the events to Colorado, which has fewer early voting days than Georgia, as well as ID requirements. Nevertheless, Democrats have continued to falsely describe the Peach State law as suppressive, even though poll after poll shows a majority of likely voters, including black and Latino voters, support basic election integrity measures such as voter ID.

All the while, Democrats have continued to push for the end of the filibuster as a means to advance their radical agenda items.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki went as far as describing the filibuster as “allowing for systematic racism in the country,” even though President Biden defended the filibuster in 2005.",1
183,Dem Rep. Escobar: Stephen Miller Should Be Jailed — ‘He Committed Heinous Human Rights Violations’,"Representative Veronica Escobar (D-TX) said Wednesday on The Intercept’s podcast that former President Donald Trump aide Stephen Miller should be jailed for human rights violations during the Trump administration’s child separation immigration policy.

Beginning at the 21:02 timestamp, host Ryan Grim said, “During the Trump administration, there were a lot of calls from Democrats and from activists saying this is not just a failure, but this is something that needs to be prosecuted. There’s so much cruelty and negligence going on. So kind of two parts, one, is there still talk about potentially prosecuting people in the past for what was done? And how long would you give the Biden administration or the DHS leadership or the CBP leadership to improve this situation before similar calls were made this time around?”

Escobar said, “So to the accountability and prosecution question, I think Stephen Miller should be behind bars. I think he committed heinous human rights violations, and I think that those around him who helped plot this out should be held accountable as well. That is going to be very difficult, but it kills me that these people could potentially walk away — and even potentially rebuild their reputations. I mean, I find them to be just among the most reprehensible, abhorrent people that our generation could have ever produced.”

187,"As Speculation Mounts of Pence’s 2024 Prospects, His PAC Board Praises Him Without Endorsing","Former Vice President Mike Pence announced the launch of his policy and advocacy organization Advancing American Freedom (AAF) this week, which aims to advance the pro-freedom policies promoted under the Trump administration. However, this, coupled with news of his two-book deal, has some wondering if he is angling for a 2024 run. While members of his PAC’s advisory board, some of whom worked closely with the Trump administration, generally support the vice president and his efforts, they are not yet throwing their full weight behind him in terms of a 2024 primary run.

“Advancing American Freedom plans to build on the success of the last four years by promoting traditional Conservative values and promoting the successful policies of the Trump Administration,” Pence said in a statement announcing the launch of the organization, warning that conservatives “will not stand idly by as the radical Left and the new administration attempt to threaten America’s standing as the greatest Nation in the world with their destructive policies.”

Advancing American Freedom is dedicated to the proposition that our nation must conserve that which matters most: the right of every American to live, to work, to worship in freedom—the very thing that has always made our country great. Learn more: https://t.co/rIrSKUnEXE — Advancing American Freedom (@AmericanFreedom) April 7, 2021

The advisory board is comprised of a collection of former Trump administration officials — including former advisor Kellyanne Conway and former economic advisor Larry Kudlow — and well-known GOP figures such as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum (R), and former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R).

Breitbart News reached out to several members of the newly minted advisory board to see whether their participation in the former vice president’s PAC serves as an indicator of a potential Pence endorsement for 2024, should he choose to run.

Several members of the advisory board expressed general support for the former vice president and his efforts but clarified their participation in the PAC is not indicative of an endorsement. Others did not respond to the inquiry.

“I agreed to serve on the Advisory Board of Advancing American Freedom to help educate Americans about the successes the Trump Administration created over the last four years, and to promote the conservative principles that make America great,” advisory board member Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of Tea Party Patriots, told Breitbart News.

“As Vice President, Mike Pence articulated and championed those values and successes, and he will continue to do so with Advancing American Freedom,” she said.

However, she said it is “entirely too early” to begin speculating on potential 2024 scenarios.

“My focus and the focus of Tea Party Patriots Action for the next two years is on blocking the implementation of the Biden-Harris plan to have the government take over every sector of American life,” she said.

David McIntosh, former Indiana congressman and president of Club for Growth, is also on the advisory board, but his spokesman told Breitbart News McIntosh’s involvement is “not an endorsement.” Similarly, a spokesman for Focus on the Family head Jim Daly said they did not have any additional comment to provide in regard to a Pence 2024 endorsement.

Pastor Robert Jeffress of Dallas’s First Baptist Church was more forward in expressing support for the former vice president, telling Breitbart News that Pence had not asked for his endorsement but adding he would “make an excellent president should he choose to run.”

“Vice-President Pence is both a godly and a seasoned leader who is the natural successor to the tremendous legacy of President Donald J. Trump,” he said.

Several hypothetical GOP 2024 primary polls, in the months following former President Trump’s departure from the Oval Office, have shown the former vice president trailing far behind Trump. A February Morning Consult/Politico poll, for example, showed Trump dominating the field with 53 percent support, followed by Pence, who garnered 12 percent. No other potential candidate held double-digit support.

While Trump has not signaled if he intends to run in 2024, some remain suspicious of Pence’s intentions, viewing his moves as laying the groundwork to politically elevate himself in the future. A source familiar with the operations and launch of Pence’s PAC cast doubts on the former vice president’s effort, describing it as a “huge missed opportunity.”

“The Pence Super PAC is a huge missed opportunity. Rather than preserve and advance the legacy of 45, he chose to make this about him,” the source told Breitbart News. “Instead of talking about the disastrous implications of a Biden presidency and the successes of President Trump’s agenda we’re now talking about whether or not a former talk radio host turned Vice President is going to lead our party.”

The source also blasted the board members, casting them as a “cast of nobodies from archaic D.C. institutions.”

“If this is Pence 2024 then he’s looking backwards and not forwards,” the source added.

Others serving on the advisory board include David Bernhardt, former U.S. Secretary of the Interior; Kirk Cameron, actor; Kelly Craft, former diplomat serving as U.S. ambassador to the UN; Jim DeMint, president of the Heritage Foundation; Doug Ducey, governor of Arizona; Penny Nance, CEO of Concerned Women for America (CWA); Seema Verma, former administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid; Scott Walker, former Wisconsin governor; Andrew Wheeler, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and more.",1
189,Arizona State Legislature Passes Resolution Vowing Defiance of Corrupt Politicians Act,"The Arizona State Legislature passed a resolution on Tuesday vowing defiance of HR 1, the effort by Democrats to nationalize the administration of elections described by its opponents as “The Corrupt Politicians Act.”

The Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on March 3 in a straight party line vote, 220 to 210, and it is currently under consideration in the U.S. Senate.

“[T]he Members of the Legislature oppose H.R. 1 and any subsequent enactment of the terms of this proposal and implore the Members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate to oppose the same,” the Arizona State Legislature’s concurrent resolution declares. (emphasis added)

The Arizona State Senate passed House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 2023 late Tuesday, also in a straight party line vote, 16 to 14, one month after the Arizona House of Representatives passed the resolution in another straight party line vote, 31 to 29.

The concurrent resolution reads:

Whereas, House Resolution 1 (H.R. 1), a bill introduced in the United States Congress, would obliterate the constitutional arrangement between the states and the government of the United States by usurping the constitutional power of states to manage, control and administer state elections by prohibiting various practices and mandating others such as forcing states to conduct an election over an extended period of time, prohibiting states from maintaining voter rolls free from error and obsolete information and forcing states to accept an elector who does not register to vote in advance, mandates related to mail voting, prohibitions against regulating ballot harvesting and scores of other intrusions into the power of states to manage, control and administer their elections. And Whereas, the power over elections was preserved explicitly for the states by the Constitution; and Whereas, H.R. 1 strikes at the very heart of the arrangement that gave rise to this nation, namely that states are sovereign and free from interference and the intrusion of power from the government of the United States absent clear constitutional authorization. Therefore, Be it resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of Arizona,the Senate concurring: 1. That the Members of the Legislature oppose any attempt by the federal government to usurp, or otherwise interfere with, the state legislative sovereign authority over the management, control and administration of elections.

2. That the Members of the Legislature oppose H.R. 1 and any subsequent enactment of the terms of this proposal and implore the Members of the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate to oppose the same.

The resolution also requires:

…the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona transmit a copy of this Resolution to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of Arizona and each Speaker of the House of Representatives and each President of the Senate of the other state legislatures.

“The ‘Corrupt Politicians Act’ is the most dangerous piece of legislation to come out of DC in generations. The bill reflects Democrats’ attempt to rig America’s electoral system in their favor and strip voters of their civil right to have their vote matter,” State Rep. Jake Hoffman (R-Queen Creek), primary sponsor of HRC 2023 in the Arizona House, told Breitbart News.

“The Arizona legislature stands unwaveringly against the Democrats’ unconstitutional power grab and attempt to federalize our state’s elections process,” Hoffman added.

Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs (R-AZ) added his support for the resolution passed by the Arizona legislature.

“While most of the country has some doubt as to the integrity of our elections, the Democrats want to ensure that we never have an honest election again. If we do not stop H.R. 1, it will become increasingly difficult to restore trust in American elections,” Biggs said in a statement released by State Rep. Hoffman’s office. ‘

“The Constitution delegates the power over elections to the legislature and we intend to fiercely oppose any effort by corrupt politicians in Washington, DC, to interfere with our sovereign authority,” Hoffman added in that statement.",1
191,"Report: Tiger Woods Had Unlabeled Pill Bottle in Car, was Combative with Officers After Crash","According to a police report of the investigation into Tiger Woods’ February 23 wreck, officers found him somewhat combative during questioning. Officers also said they found an unlabeled pill bottle in the wrecked vehicle.

The report collected by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department noted that an “empty plastic pharmaceutical container” was found in a backpack found in the bushes outside the car after the accident.

“The container had no label, and there was no indication as to what, if anything, had been inside,” the report says, according to TMZ.

Officials noted that surveillance video showed Woods toting a similar backpack at the five-star Terranea Resort on the morning of the accident.

However, the report also says that investigators did not find any drugs or alcohol in the car or crash scene.

Still, the 45-year-old golf great was reportedly combative with the EMTs who arrived at the scene to treat him after the wreck. He was reported as “somewhat combative” and disoriented as he sat bloodied in the driver’s seat of his vehicle.

“Captain Levesque told me that [Woods] was somewhat combative when they were trying to treat him on scene,” the officer who made the report wrote.

Woods’ blood pressure was also too low from the shock of the crash to be administered any pain medications, the report says.

“[Los Angeles Fire Captain Matt] Levesque stated everything that he observed related to [Woods’] vital signs and combativeness was consistent with the type of traumatic injury,” the report states.

The L.A. Sheriffs have taken some criticism for not performing a sobriety test or taking blood from Woods immediately after the crash, not to mention for quickly announcing that no charges would be filed.

This week, officials said that data and crime scene evidence found that Woods’ vehicle was driving at 83 MPH, about twice the speed limit, before wrecking. It also appears that Woods never hit the brakes before the wreck.

Authorities say that no charges will be leveled at the five-time Masters’ tournament champion because there weren’t any witnesses and no one else was injured.

193,MLB Commissioner Feared All-Star Game Relocation Would Become a 'Political Event',"Major League Baseball’s (MLB) Commissioner Robert Manfred feared relocating the All-Star Game from Atlanta because the move would balloon into a “political event.”

According to a Fox Business report, after Stacey Abrams, LeBron James, and Al Sharpton urged MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred to relocate the All-Star Game from Atlanta, the MLB Commissioner apprehensively made the decision.

Breitbart News reported the three individuals did indeed hold extensive discussions with the MLB Commissioner, influencing him to move the All-Star Game due to players potentially boycotting the event. But when the news broke of the relocation, Abrams tweeted she was “Disappointed @MLB will move the All-Star Game, but proud of their stance on voting rights. GA GOP traded economic opportunity for suppression.”

Abrams honesty about her current stance “is suspect,” Fox News reported. However, LeBron James, who holds huge sway with the sports world and social justice warriors, has continued his opposition to Atlanta holding the All-Star Game.

Meanwhile, the MLB Commissioner rendered his final decision, telling “the eight-member executive committee before making the announcement, which surprised the 22 other teams.” But Manfred “said the decision was made after discussions with the MLB Players Association and its Players Alliance.”

The game was ultimately relocated to Denver, home of the Colorado Rockies, who play at Coors Field, which is named after a “founder of the Heritage Foundation, Joseph Coors, the former president of Coors Brewing Company, who died in 2003 after setting up a legal foundation that challenged part of the Voting Rights Act,” Breitbart News reported Tuesday.

The upheaval over the All-Star Game comes after the State of Georgia’s legislature took action on election integrity by limiting the number and location of drop boxes, reforming voter ID requirements, and expanding early voting access statewide while modernizing the state’s voter rolls.",1
195,Phillip Adams’ Dad Says Football ‘Messed Him Up’ Long Before Shooting,"Ex-NFL player Phillip Adams’ father said Thursday that his son was “messed up” by concussions playing football and that the injuries likely played a part in his death.

“I can say he’s a good kid. I think the football messed him up,” said Alonzo Adams, the father of the one-time Oakland Raiders player, according to WCNC.

Mr. Adams also said he did not know his son having a history of violence ahead of the April 14 shooting of five people ending in his suicide. “I don’t think he ever did anybody any harm,” Adams added.

On Wednesday, the former player shot and killed Dr. Robert Lesslie, 70, his wife, Barbara Lesslie, 69, and two of their grandchildren, 9-year-old Adah Lesslie and 5-year-old Noah Lesslie. He also wounded 38-year-old James Lewis.

“He used to be my doctor a long time ago. I know they were good folks down there. We’re gonna keep them in our prayers,” Mr. Adams said of the murdered doctor.

No motive for the shooting has been reported.

Phillip Adams was selected in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers, but he soon broke his ankle during a game against the St. Louis Rams. The 49ers released him the next year, and he bounced around from the Patriots, Seahawks to the Raiders, the Jets, and the Falcons until ending his career in 2015.

Along with the ankle injury, Adams also suffered several concussions during his football career.

197,Rapinoe Blasts Draymond Green for Criticizing Women's Equal Pay Movement,"U.S. Women’s National Team soccer star Megan Rapinoe is blasting NBA player Draymond Green’s criticism of the equal pay movement for women in sports, saying his comments are “really unfortunate.”

During a recent Zoom call about the summer Olympics in Tokyo, Rapinoe slammed Green for his dismissive claim that women in sports are just “complaining” with little legitimacy about what they are paid compared to male athletes, ESPN reported.

Rapinoe accused Green of being uneducated on the issues.

“It’s really unfortunate, in the position [Green’s] in, having all of the resources that he has and the ability to have a much more educated opinion, that he just hasn’t,” Rapinoe said on Tuesday, adding, “And then, drag all these other people into it by tagging them and speaking at a time when the [NCAA] tournament is going on and all that we saw with the lack of resources and funding.”

Rapinoe went on with harsh criticism of the Golden State Warriors center:

That’s frustrating that’s the take you have. You obviously showed your whole ass in not even understanding what we all talk about all the time — WNBA players and us on the national team. Like what Sue [Bird] said, you tagged the wrong people. You don’t think we asked for more money? I mean, what are we screaming about? Nonstop! We are getting obnoxious to ourselves, to be honest. And then two or three days later, to completely double down on it is really frustrating. We know all this, about all social movements and all people who are marginalized, whether it’s by race or gender, religion, sexuality, whatever it is, it is not just their job to be the ones fighting oppression. We need all of the other people as well. So to have someone who does know what it is like to be oppressed, in many ways, to heap that all back on female players, or people who play female sports, it is just really disappointing.

Rapinoe was responding to several tweets Green posted on March 27 in which he took the women in the WNBA to task for merely “complaining” about not being paid the same as men even as their league lags far behind the revenue the NBA brings in.

I’ve been seeing a lot of talk about the pay gap between women and men. Especially in sports. It’s not even close. But let’s stop allowing y’all complaints to fall on deaf ears due to numbers. As long as y’all make the argument about pay, while the revenue stays the same… — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) March 27, 2021

They will continue to point at the revenue not being high enough to cover bigger salaries. While that is true in damn near every business, how do we take that card out of their pockets? That’s the key to changing the pay. There’s no argument for lack of revenue, unless… — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) March 27, 2021

You make those that say they stand for women actually stand up. The NBA wasn’t always the global game that it is today. It wasn’t always driving as much revenue as it does today. But there were people behind it, building the platform, and more importantly telling INDIVIDUAL… — Draymond Green (@Money23Green) March 27, 2021

Green also spoke about the issues in an interview where he added that instead of sitting around and complaining, the female athletes need to convince powerful people and companies to support their sport more than they do.

Thanks to those who've taken an interest in this issue. I wanted to post the second half of this interaction with @KerithBurke & Draymond. He says women need to call out companies/entities who aren't valuing female athletes (they have been). Men with power need to do it too. pic.twitter.com/uz3nEoLNvk — Kylen Mills (@KylenMills) April 5, 2021

199,"Jobless Claims Unexpectedly Jump to 744,000, Much Worse Than Expected","New weekly jobless claims rose to 744,000 for the week that ended April 3rd, the Department of Labor said Thursday.

Economists had forecast a decline to 680,000 from the previous week’s 719,000. This is the second consecutive week in which initial jobless claims moved up in contradiction to expectations. The upper end of the range of forecasts in the Econoday survey was 705,000.

Jobless claims can be volatile week to week so economists like to look at the four-week average. This rose by 2,500 to 723,750.

Continuing claims, which get reported with a week’s lag, fell to 3,734,000, a decrease of 16,000, in the week ended March 27.

Including new programs for gig workers and small business owners, the total number of continued weeks claimed for benefits in all programs for the week ending March 20—the most recent data available—was18,164,588, a decrease of just 50,862 from the previous week.

Claims hit a record 6.87 million for the week of March 27, more than ten times the previous record. Through spring and early summer, each subsequent week had seen claims decline. But in late July, the labor market appeared to stall and claims hovered around one million throughout August, a level so high it was never recorded before the pandemic struck. Claims moved down again in September and had made slow, if steady, progress until the election and the resurgence of Covid-19 infections when they rose again. In the last few weeks, however, claims have once again been moving steadily downward.

Many states eased or eliminated restrictions on businesses, including restaurants and bars, in March. Forty-three states are now mostly open. This has led to a surge of economic activity. As well, the American Rescue Act authorized $1.9 trillion of stimulus money, although only a small fraction of that has been spent so far.

But infections have recently been rising, which could be a drag on workers seeking employment and hiring.",1
200,MSNBC Host Apologizes for Airing Video of Wrong Black Congressman,"MSNBC said it mistakenly aired video of the wrong black congressman during a recent report on the death of Rep. Alcee Hastings (D-FL).

“Earlier when reporting on the death of Rep. Alcee Hastings, we showed video of Rep. Bennie Thompson,” the outlet’s Hallie Jackson said in a tweet Tuesday of the mistake that reportedly occurred on her show Hallie Jackson Reports.

“We deeply regret the error,” she added:

Earlier when reporting on the death of Rep. Alcee Hastings, we showed video of Rep. Bennie Thompson. We deeply regret the error. — Hallie Jackson Reports (@HallieOnMSNBC) April 6, 2021

According to the New York Post, Jackson apologized a second time for the blunder on Wednesday, saying it “should never have happened.”

“We are sorry it did. Congressman Hastings served the state of Florida for nearly three decades and the House and deserves a tribute worthy of that service,” she commented.

The congressman, who was “dogged throughout his tenure by an impeachment that ended his fast-rising judicial career,” passed away Tuesday at age 84, the Associated Press (AP) reported.

Hastings announced two years ago he was suffering from pancreatic cancer, the article continued:

Under Florida law, Gov. Ron DeSantis will call a special election in the coming months to fill the vacancy. Hastings’ district is overwhelmingly Democratic — he received 80% of the vote in November. Hastings’ death, meanwhile, lowers the Democrats’ majority to a scant 218-211 in the House. Their narrow margin is forcing the party to muster nearly unanimous votes to push legislation through the chamber, and is bolstering Republican hopes for capturing House control in the 2022 elections. There are six vacancies – four from seats that were held by Democrats, two by Republicans.

Following the apology, Twitter users expressed their disappointment with MSNBC.

“A news or a reporter that is so lazy they don’t validate. We all look alike/not. Stop acting woke and hire diverse people so this stops,” one user replied to Jackson.

“Proof positive you do NOT have enough POC’s in the right places. Do better!” another person wrote.",1
201,CNN: Joe Biden's Executive Gun Controls 'Far Short' of Promises,"CNN suggests the executive gun controls President Joe Biden plans to announce late Thursday morning fall “far short” of promises he made on the campaign trail.

According to CNN, “Biden… will harness the powers of the presidency to advance a half-dozen executive actions on gun control, but they fall far short of the ambitious goals he outlined as a presidential candidate as the real fight still looms on Capitol Hill.”

On Wednesday, Breitbart News noted Biden was pushing ahead with executive controls instead of waiting for Congress to take action via legislation.

The White House released a fact sheet pointing out the executive actions include specific actions the Department of Justice is being instructed to take re: gun control. Those specific actions include:

The Justice Department, within 60 days, will publish model “red flag” legislation for states.

The Justice Department, within 60 days, will issue a proposed rule to make clear when a device marketed as a stabilizing brace effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act.

The Justice Department, within 30 days, will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of “ghost guns.”

Breitbart observed recategorizing AR-pistols may result in stringent gun controls for current owners and would-be purchasers alike.

For example, if the purchase of AR-pistols is categorized as the purchase of a “short-barreled rifle” the process of buying the firearm could require being fingerprinted and photographed, as well as undergoing a background check, registering the firearm with the ATF, paying the federal government a $200 tax (on top of the price of the firearm), and waiting nine to ten months for the whole purchasing process to be completed.

That is the standard process for other short barrel rifles and other firearms and accessories under the purview of the National Firearms Act.

Biden’s push for gun controls was highlighted even before he took office:

202,Nolte: Far-Left New York Times Pushes Junk Science Linking Coronavirus Spikes to NFL Games,"“As the N.F.L. makes plans to return to stadiums at full capacity this season, researchers published findings that ‘fan attendance at N.F.L. games led to episodic spikes’ in the number of Covid-19 cases,” the far-left New York Times reports. (I don’t link to fake news.)

There is just one teensy-tiny, itty-bitty, little problem with this so-called study…

There’s no hard science to back up the claim. Most importantly, the science is not based on contact tracing. Nevertheless, here’s the Times headline…

“New Study Finds Covid Spikes After N.F.L. Games With Fans.”

Actually, no it doesn’t.

Here are the key parts of the story. Emphasis throughout is mine:

Justin Kurland of the University of Southern Mississippi, used the number of positive cases not just from the counties where the 32 N.F.L. teams play, but also from surrounding counties to track the spread among fans who may have traveled to games from farther away. After adjusting the figures to eliminate potential false positives and days when counties did not report cases, they found surges in infection rates in the second and third weeks following N.F.L. games that were played with more than 5,000 fans in attendance. The study does not prove a causal link between fan attendance and Covid-19 cases, but suggests that there may be a relationship between the two.

And then, way down in paragraph 16 — 16! — we are finally told this:

The authors of the study submitted to The Lancet concede that their research only shows that two events — games with fans and increasing positive Covid-19 rates — coincided. Other events like political rallies, the reopening of colleges or holiday travel may have contributed to an increase in infections, especially in states where preventive measures like the wearing of masks were less widely adopted. Infections may have also increased because fans watched games with their friends in living rooms or at bars, gatherings that were beyond the N.F.L.’s control.

It gets worse…

“[N]ot everyone cooperated with contact tracers’ requests, even people who attended N.F.L. games and tested positive had difficulty determining whether they got infected before, during or after the games,’ the Times admits in paragraph 17.

“Eight residents who tested positive for the virus told contact tracers that they had recently attended Cowboys home games,” we learned in paragraph 18.

Oh, my, a whole eight people out of tens of thousands. Eight!

You cannot prove causation with infections without in-depth contact tracing, which makes this study junk science and a naked act of pro-lockdown hysteria.

Hey, it may very well be that attending football games increases China Virus infections. But maybe, just maybe, before you publish a report announcing that, you should be sure of that. We’re only talking about the economic and personal liberty of more than 300 million Americans here.

But here’s my thought…

If rioting and looting and burning down Democrat-run cities don’t cause coronavirus infections to spread, and if celebrating His Fraudulency Joe Biden’s win doesn’t cause infections to spread, my guess is that neither do NFL games.

Why is it always the stuff normal people do — stuff like celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas, stuff like attending an NFL game — that may cause infections to spike, but whatever the freaks on the left do — rioting, looting, burning, protesting, etc. — is perfectly safe?

Regardless, I will always revert to my overall, bottom-line opinion about all of this…

Everyone knows the risks of the China Virus, which means everyone should be allowed to make their own decisions about how to handle it.

If people choose not to wear masks and not to social distance and not to avoid big crowds, that in no way harms those of us who do choose to do those things.

People should be allowed to take whatever risks they want…

The New York Times and the Lancet should not be publishing junk science just to please lockdown Nazis…

America’s “experts” and their allies in the fake media continue to prove they are useless and corrupt.

203,"FNC’s Carlson: Biden, Corporate America Push for ‘Equity’ Divides and Endangers Us","Wednesday, FNC host Tucker Carlson opened his show questioning the drive for so-called equity by elite institutions in the United States.

Carlson pointed to the lack of a definition of “equity” but also noted how it justifies policies that could be perceived as “racism.”

Transcript as follows:

CARLSON: You know what people care about most by what’s at the top of their to-do list, and on his very first day in office, Joe Biden signed something called an Executive Order on advancing racial equity and support for underserved communities. You ought to go read it. Go ahead and see if you can figure out what it means.

The document uses the term “equity” a total of 21 times and yet, revealingly never defines the word. So what is equity? Joe Biden never tells us, never even hints. He sort of proclaims that America will be getting, quote, “an ambitious whole of government equity agenda.”

So whatever it is, equity is ambitious, and it will be everywhere, but we’re not allowed to know what it is. That’s odd.

For three months, we’ve been trying to guess: what is this equity that is now our country’s main reason for existing? We know it’s not the same as equality or even closely related. In the name of equity, for example, the Biden administration supports open discrimination against Asian college applicants. They’re Asian, therefore they can’t get into school. It is that simple.

We used to call that kind of behavior, racism. We had laws against it. Now, we call it equity, and we have laws demanding it. It turns out that racism and equity are pretty much the same thing. Who knew?

Here’s the latest illustration of the principle and it comes not from the Biden administration, but from United Airlines. United used to be a conventional commercial air carrier. It flew airplanes from place to place, most of the time uneventfully. That was the old United Airlines.

The new United is very different. It’s a combination of a hyper-aggressive corporate H.R. Department and a left-wing Political Action Committee. The new United Airlines is big on moral pronouncements and mandatory social engineering. United has embraced equity.

Here is its latest directive spelled out yesterday on Twitter, quote: “Our flight deck should reflect the diverse group of people onboard our planes every day. That’s why we plan for 50% of the 5,000 pilots we train in the next decade to be women or people of color.” End quote.

United Airlines is mandating affirmative action quotas in its flight schools and that’s a big change for the country. When Coca-Cola embraces some equity scheme, you’ll understand why they’re doing it. They’re hoping that by hiring more black executives, no one will ask just how many black Americans have gotten diabetes from drinking Coke. For Coca-Cola, equity is a purely defensive PR move, and it makes sense.

But airlines are different. An airline pilot transports hundreds of people at a time in a thin-walled metal tube going nearly 600 miles an hour 35,000 feet off the ground. Flying a commercial airliner is dangerous. Like performing heart surgery, no matter how many times you’ve done it, it is inherently high stakes. People die if you screw up.

In the airline business, as in Medicine, not killing people is all that matters.

So how will racial and gender quotas make United Airlines safer? That’s the only question that matters. The company CEO went on CBS News recently to explain.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): Only 7% of United Airlines pilots are women. One of the highest%ages in the industry, and 13% of its pilots are people of color.

SCOTT KIRBY, CEO, UNITED AIRLINES: They simply don’t have the access or the opportunity.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (voice-over): In an exclusive interview with CBS News, United CEO, Scott Kirby, is announcing a new effort to bring balance to the flight deck.

KIRBY: We are excited at United to be announcing the United Aviator Academy to address the structural issues with the makeup of our pilots.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: So only 7% of United Airlines pilots are female, fretted CBS, only 13% aren’t white. Okay. But why exactly should we care about those numbers?

An airline pilot’s job is to land the plane safely. Everything else is irrelevant. If a hundred% of United Airlines pilots were black women or Malaysian Muslims, or for that matter, white men from Alabama, not a single sane person would complain about it as long as the airplanes didn’t crash. Safety is all that matters.

But you’ll notice the CEO of United didn’t mention safety. Safety is no longer that airlines’ top concern, identity politics is.

Now, United will dispute that characterization, of course. In a statement to the show two hours ago, they already have disputed it. “United Airlines will continue to uphold its high standards,” they told us, but they’re lying. We know they’re lying and you know it, too, because in the airline business, there is only one standard that matters and it is not race and it is not gender, it is competence.

The way people look is totally irrelevant. How they perform is all you should care about.

Once you forget that, airplanes tend to crash. Everyone knows that’s true, very much, including the people who run this country. Many of them don’t fly United, they don’t fly commercial at all. They use NetJets, the largest private airline in the world.

Has NetJets embraced equity or hiring quotas? Of course. Check out the NetJets’ website, if you have a minute, and they’ll tell you exactly what they’re looking for in the airline pilots they hire. Here’s the first line: “We seek individuals who demonstrate an unwavering dedication to safety.” That’s the first requirement on their list. We couldn’t find any mention of race or gender and that should not surprise you. Because once again, race and gender are literally irrelevant to who flies your airplane.

Nancy Pelosi and John Kerry and the rest of our private jet dependent ruling class know that perfectly well. They will not be demanding quotas at NetJets anytime soon. Their families fly on NetJets airplanes.

So if hiring on the basis of irrelevant criteria, will overtime get people killed, and it will, why are they demanding it? Because they don’t care. They are ideologues. They are suffering from an incurable brain disease called wokeness. Reality means nothing to them, it’s merely an impediment to their plans.

Watch the new head of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, ironically, a black supremacist called Kristen Clarke admit as much. She told us a few years ago, equity is more important than safety.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Do you think that airlines should apply the same diversity rules you’re calling for here? That they shouldn’t take the people who score the highest on the pilot tests, but that they should hire also on appearance: the way people look?

KRISTEN CLARKE, AMERICAN ATTORNEY: Every workplace, whether you’re talking about airlines or Federal agencies …

CARLSON: Oh, so pilots to heart surgeons, too?

CLARKE: … should hire the best but should place a premium on diversity.

CARLSON: But which is more important?

CLARKE: And Secretary Zinke’s —

CARLSON: The way that you look or what you do? What you’re capable of doing? So like when you’re flying the plane, how important is it what you look like? Your appearance?

CLARKE: Incredibly important, and it’s also important …

CARLSON: Appearance is incredibly important.

CLARKE: … that we have. It is also important that we place a premium on diversity.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: What you look like is an essential quality. It’s incredibly important in an airline pilot.

What are we watching here exactly? Well, it is deluded, but it’s also pretty clearly a racial attack. Kristen Clarke is saying, the CEO of United Airlines is saying that we need to replace the pilots currently flying airplanes because they’re the wrong skin color.

Only diseased people think like this. Imagine if we applied the same standard to other professions. How about professional sports? African- American men account for roughly six% of the American population, and yet about 75% of the players in the National Basketball League are black men. That doesn’t sound like equity. It sounds like what Kristen Clarke refers to as disproportionate representation.

So what if to remedy that lack of equity, the NBA announced tomorrow that going forward, at least half of its players, 50% had to be white, Asian, Hispanic or female to better represent the fans in the stands? How would we respond to that? We would understand immediately, and we would say so that that is a racist policy.

No one even alleged that NBA players are doing a bad job. We had all assumed correctly, as we do with airline pilots, that they were hired in the first place because they were the best that company could find.

But nevertheless, they had to be replaced because they were the wrong race and gender. It’s sick. You think it couldn’t happen? Why wouldn’t it happen?

By the logic of identity politics, it has to happen.

NBA players make a whole lot more than airline pilots. At some point, someone is going to notice that. And that’s the whole problem with this way of thinking, this diseased way of thinking.

You do not want to live in a completely racialized country, where a person’s genetics are the most important thing about them, where you will reduce to your DNA, dehumanized, but that’s exactly the society they’re creating.

And what’s the result of what they’re doing? Every action provokes a reaction. That’s the most basic principle in Physics. When you attack people for qualities they can’t control, over time, you will make them radical. That is guaranteed.

You’ve got to wonder if it’s ever occurred to the morons pushing this equity garbage that everyone on Earth has an identity. If you make identity politics mandatory, and they have, how long until you get white identity politics? Ever consider that, you reckless fools? How long before there is no national identity at all in this country? Only warring tribes fighting each other for the spoils.

Does anyone want to raise children in a society like that? Only the racist want that. But that’s exactly where they’re pushing us and at high speed.

A couple of years ago, we reported the Federal Aviation Administration had lowered its standards in order to bring equity to air traffic control. As part of that initiative, the FAA began administering something called a biographical questionnaire to applicants. This is significant for all the people tempted to believe United or the U.S. Military when they say that by bringing equity to the process, they’re not lowering standards. They are by definition.

Candidates were asked in the case of the FAA, whether they got mostly A’s in high school, if they said they did, yes, they got five points for A’s. Candidates were also asked if they had been unemployed for the past three years, and if they answered yes to that question, they got 10 points. They get double the points for three years of unemployment, as they did for getting straight A’s.

How does that make us safer? That’s a rhetorical question, obviously. It divides and endangers us. But that’s equity.",1
204,"‘Neck’ Becomes ‘Neck Area’ for Prosecution, Media in George Floyd Trial","The prosecution in the trial of former Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officer Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd has begun referring to the victim’s “neck area” rather than his “neck” after the defense pointed out that Chauvin’s knee was not on his neck throughout the entire encounter, as the media previously reported.

Earlier this week, Chauvin’s defense attorney, Eric Nelson, citing “camera perspective bias,” elicited testimony from Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo on cross-examination in which Arradondo agreed that Chauvin had placed his knee on Floyd’s “shoulder blade” at one point.

As Legal Insurrection analyst Andrew Branca noted on Wednesday, the prosecution has begun referring to Floyd’s “neck area” as a result:

Nelson began displaying images of the knee placement from different angles showing that Chauvin’s knee appeared to be on Floyd’s shoulders and back, rather than on Floyd’s neck. Indeed, Lt. [Johnny]Mercil, the state’s expert on MPD use-of-force training and policy explicitly agreed on cross-examination that this appeared to be the case. So what’s the state to do when a key facet of their narrative of criminal conduct is contradicted by their own expert? Move the goals posts, of course. Today, however, Prosecutor Schleiter and his state-paid use of force expert Stiger began to avoid the claim that Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck, and instead started referring to Chauvin’s knee being on Floyd’s “neck area.” What’s the “neck area”? Well, the shoulders and upper back!

Other elements of the prosecution’s case have been thrown into doubt on cross-examination, as Breitbart News noted Wednesday.

Yet the media continue to report the trial as if the prosecution had made an irrefutable case. The Associated Press, for example, published its analysis under the headline: “Expert: Chauvin never took knee off Floyd’s neck area.”

Critics fear that the media’s one-sided coverage of the trial could shape public expectations in a way that would encourage outrage in the event that Chauvin is not convicted.

205,Nolte: Far-left PolitiFact Says the ’60 Minutes’ DeSantis Video ‘Could’ Be ‘Deceptive Editing’,"PolitiFact, a dishonest and discredited left-wing fact checker, can only bring itself to admit video of Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) that was deliberately and maliciously edited by the long-discredited 60 Minutes, “could constitute deceptive editing.”

“The ’60 Minutes’ segment omits some of the background on why Florida partnered with Publix to distribute coronavirus vaccines. That omission could constitute ‘deceptive editing,’ as some social media users have claimed,” the far-left PolitiFact wrote on Wednesday (I don’t link to fake news).

And this is how the corporate media cult protect one another….

60 Minutes is caught red-handed telling lies so provably false and so audacious that two Democrat state officials are now siding with DeSantis… 60 Minutes is caught red-handed editing out DeSantis giving a 60 Minutes hack a full and complete answer to her question… And the left-wing hacks at PolitiFact run in to the rescue.

When you ask a politician a question and the politician answers your question at length and to the satisfaction of any reasonable person, and then you edit out his answer and only include the part where he’s pushing back against the questioner, that is CLEARLY a case of deceptive and malicious editing. It is also a case of media fraud and a deliberate act on the part of 60 Minutes to deceive whoever is stupid enough to still watch that stupid show.

PolitiFact is so dishonest it doesn’t even laugh at 60 Minutes’ ridiculous explanation for its malicious edit:

A CBS News spokesperson told PolitiFact the comments were edited for clarity, a common journalistic practice. “As we always do for clarity, ‘60 Minutes’ used the portion of the governor’s over two-minute response that directly addressed the question from the correspondent,” the spokesperson said.

On what planet is editing out the politician answering your question an act of “editing for clarity?”

Who in their right mind believes editing out the answer to the question will in some way bring “clarity?”

This hideous woman at 60 Minutes asked DeSantis a question, and here is about 95 percent of his answer:

So first of all … the first pharmacies that had it were CVS and Walgreens. And they had a long-term care mission, so they were going to the long-term care facilities. They got vaccine in the middle of December, they started going to the long-term care facilities the third week of December to do LTCs. So that was their mission, that was very important and we trusted them to do that. As we got into January we wanted to expand the distribution points. So yes, you had the counties, you had some drive-thru sites, you had hospitals that were doing a lot. But we wanted to get it into communities more, so we reached out to other retail pharmacies — Publix, Walmart. Obviously CVS and Walgreens had to finish that mission, and we said we’re going to use you as soon as you’re done with that. For the Publix, they were the first one to raise their hands (and) say they were ready to go. And you know what? We did it on a trial basis. I had three counties. I actually showed up that weekend and talked to seniors across four different Publix — How was the experience? Is this good? Should you think this is a way to go? — and it was 100% positive. So we expanded it and then folks liked it. And I can tell you, if you look at a place like Palm Beach County, they were kind of struggling at first in terms of the senior numbers. … So we did that, and what ended up happening was, you had 65 Publix in Palm Beach. Palm Beach is one of the biggest counties, one of the most elderly counties. We’ve done almost 75% of the seniors in Palm Beach, and the reason is because you have the strong retail footprint. So our way has been multi-faceted, it has worked — and we’re also now very much expanding CVS and Walgreens now that they’ve completed the long-term care mission.

Every word of the above was edited out by 60 Minutes, the meat of the answer was deliberately removed. Not one word of that was included. But 60 Minutes did leave this part of the DeSantis answer in:

I just disabused you of the narrative and you don’t care about the facts, because obviously I laid it out for you in a way that is irrefutable. And so it’s clearly not.

Again, how is that “editing for clarity?” And how does that fall under “could be” deceptive editing for any fair-minded person, especially one that poses as a fact checker?

But this is how the game is played…

A member of the elite media cult is caught red-handed committing fraud….

Nolte: Within 24 hours, the '60 Minutes' hit piece on Gov. Ron DeSantis collapsed into a steaming pile of fake news. https://t.co/8onflQlNgI — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 6, 2021

Another member of the elite media cult is sent in to pose as fact checker and gaslight the public by muddying the waters with words like “could.”

Bottom line: All the corporate media do is lie, lie, lie, lie, lie; and when they’re caught lying, their fake fact checkers, like PolitiFact, rush in with more lies, lies, lies, lies to protect them.

Look at all the lies PolitiFact has told over the years. Lie after lie after lie after lie.

Shamelessly dishonest propaganda all up and down the line.

206,Katie Hill Lawsuit vs. Daily Mail over ‘Revenge Porn’ Tossed Out in California,"A California state court dismissed a lawsuit by former U.S. Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA) against the UK Daily Mail on Wednesday in which she sued the publication for publishing “revenge porn” photos of her with a female staffer.

As Breitbart News reported in October 2019, the RedState blog and the Daily Mail published the photos, which were apparently leaked by Hill’s estranged husband. Hill resigned over the affair, though not before casting her last vote to impeach President Donald Trump.

In December, as Breitbart News reported, Hill sued RedState and the Daily Mail, among others. Liberal constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley, while sympathetic, criticized Hill for “seeking a radical extension of liability for the media.”

But the Daily Mail invoked California’s anti-SLAPP law, a law that seeks to discourage “strategic lawsuits against public participation” that interfere with free speech by using litigation to intimidate the media or make criticism of public officials potentially too costly.

A Los Angeles court agreed, and tossed Hill’s suit against the Daily Mail — with similar outcomes likely for the other defendants, the Los Angeles Times reported:

The Daily Mail’s news gathering and publication of images depicting a nude Hill brushing another woman’s hair and holding a bong are protected by the 1st Amendment, and the content of the pictures was in the public interest because of Hill’s position as an elected official, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Yolanda Orozco wrote in a decision that dismissed Hill’s case against the Daily Mail. … Hill sued the Daily Mail, Red State, journalist Jennifer Van Laar and ex-husband Kenneth Heslap, arguing they violated California’s revenge-porn law by distributing and/or publishing the intimate photographs. The media outlets and Van Laar argued that Hill failed to meet the requirements of the law because they were not the original distributors of the images, because Hill’s nipples and genitals were redacted in the published pictures, and because of a “public interest” exemption. They asserted a 1st Amendment right to publish information about an elected official’s behavior that is newsworthy. … Wednesday’s ruling in favor of the Daily Mail could indicate similarrulings are likely for Van Laar and Red State because they made analogousarguments, said Krista Lee Baughman, Van Laar’s attorney.

Hill’s attorney, Carrie Goldberg, called the Daily Mail a “woman-terrorizing sicko publication” in a tweet:

This is just phase 1 of the fight. There's much more in store. Daily Mail may have won this motion, but they will go down in history as a woman-terrorizing sicko publication. And this will get reversed. 14/14 — Carrie A. Goldberg (@cagoldberglaw) April 7, 2021

Hill expressed similar sentiments, warning of the implications for women in politics:

I sued the Daily Mail for their publication of my nonconsensual nude images. Today, we lost in court because a judge – not a jury – thinks revenge porn is free speech. This fight has massive implications for any woman who ever wants to run for office, so quitting isn’t an option. https://t.co/Sjhl5XOB6j — Katie Hill (@KatieHill4CA) April 7, 2021

She vowed to appeal.

207,Anti-Trump New York Times Columnist Calls on Biden to Finish Border Wall,"Bret Stephens, a Never Trump columnist for the New York Times who backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, has published a column in which he calls upon President Joe Biden to finish Trump’s wall along the southern U.S. border.

Noting that “the Biden administration’s concept of compassion” is also “an inducement to recklessness” among migrants, Stephens writes:

That’s a conclusion I’ve come to reluctantly, and not because I’ve abandoned my disgust with Donald Trump. Walls are ugly things: symbols of defensive, suspicious, often closed-minded civilizations. Walls are, invariably, permeable: Whatever else a border wall will do, it will not seal off America from unwanted visitors or undocumented workers — roughly half of whom arrive legally and overstay their visas. Walls also cannot address the root cause of our immigration crisis, which stems from a combination of social collapse south of the border and the pull of American life north of it. But a well-built wall should still be a central part of an overall immigration fix. It’s an imperfect but functional deterrent against the most reckless forms of border crossing. It’s a barrier against sudden future surges of mass migration. It’s also a political bargaining chip to be traded for a path to citizenship in a comprehensive immigration-reform bill. And it’s a prophylactic against the next populist revolt, which is sure to overtake our politics if the Biden administration cannot competently control an elementary function of governance.

Read Bret Stephens’s full column here.

Earlier this week, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who opposed Trump’s border wall and has called Trump’s policies inhumane, was reported to be considering resume wall construction to fill gaps that encouraged illegal crossings, amidst a political crisis for the new administration.

Last year, Stephens called the coronavirus pandemic Trump’s “Chernobyl.” He did occasionally praise Trump for successes, such as the flourishing of peace in the Middle East after Trump broke with the Beltway foreign policy consensus and moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, as Congress had directed decades before.

208,"Former VP Mike Pence to Publish Autobiography, Launch PAC","Former Vice President Mike Pence will publish his autobiography as part of a two-book deal with Simon & Schuster. The announcement came on Wednesday, coinciding with the launch of Pence’s Advancing American Freedom PAC.

According to the publisher, the autobiography will focus on:

…Pence’s faith and public service, covering his trajectory from Columbus, IN, to his time as the second-highest ranking official in the Trump Administration. Pence will address the many pivotal moments of the administration, from the time he was selected to run as Vice President through Inauguration Day on January 20, 2021.

Pence is represented by David Vigliano and Thomas Flannery of Vigliano Associates. The first book is tentatively set to be released in 2023.

Pence also released information about his Advancing American Freedom PAC on Wednesday. The PAC’s goal is

…to promote the pro-freedom policies of the last four years that created unprecedented prosperity at home and restored respect for America abroad, to defend those policies from liberal attacks and media distortions, and to prevent the radical Left from enacting its policy agenda that would threaten America’s freedoms.

Members of the Advancing American Freedom Advisory Board include Kirk Cameron, Kellyanne Conway, Newt Gingrich, Larry Kudlow, Rick Santorum, Seema Verma, and Scott Walker.

The PAC’s Executive Director, Paul Teller, says:

Under the leadership of President Trump and Vice President Pence, Americans experienced unprecedented prosperity. The policies that led to those accomplishments are now under attack by the radical Left and the Biden Administration, and the foundation of our Nation is under siege.

CNN reported Wednesday that inside sources disclosed “the former vice president’s [book] deal is worth seven figures, somewhere in the range of $3 million to $4 million.”

Pence is the first prominent member of the Trump Administration to have a contract for an autobiography after President Donald Trump left office.

Dana Canedy, Senior Vice President and Publisher of Simon & Schuster, said, “His revelatory autobiography will be the definitive book on one of the most consequential presidencies in American history.”

Pence consistently ranks high for Republicans as a possible 2024 presidential nominee.

In February, Breitbart News reported that Pence joined the Heritage Foundation. “The Heritage Foundation is a flagship of the conservative movement and I am profoundly honored to join them as a distinguished visiting fellow to advance conservative policies that will benefit every American,” Pence said.",1
209,Psaki: 'I May Regret' Welcoming Disgraced Dan Rather into White House,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki tweeted Wednesday former news anchor Dan Rather is welcome in the White House press briefing room “anytime,” noting “she may regret” the invitation.

Psaki’s response originated from Rather’s tweet at Psaki, which praised her for reminding him of his “daily” White House beat. “Would be fun to find my way back to the briefing room again the future,” he prodded.

Watching the back and forth between the White House press corps and the deft @PressSec Jen Psaki reminds me of when that was my daily beat. I miss it sometimes. Would be fun to find my way back to the briefing room again the future. — Dan Rather (@DanRather) April 6, 2021

Psaki responded by saying, “I may regret this, but you are welcome anytime! there is always a seat for @DanRather in the briefing room.”

Rather’s history as a journalist is colored. Outspokenly one-sided about former President Trump’s presidency, he received the boot from CBS News after claiming in 2004 George W. Bush went AWOL from the Texas Air National Guard.

The Bush administration asserted the documents utilized as the report’s bedrock were counterfeit, tipping off a nonpartisan investigation that ultimately found the news report ignored “fundamental journalistic principles.” The documents were never, however, revealed to be forgeries.

“Dan Rather was always a lousy, biased, beclowned newsman, but it wasn’t until he tried to foist off those laughably obvious forged documents about President George W. Bush’s time in the Texas Air National Guard that his all of his prideful and left-wing flaws finally came home to roost,” John Nolte from Breitbart News wrote of Rather.

“And they’re still roosting,” Nolte said. “To this day, Rather continues to make an ass of himself defending a disgraced career and the thoroughly discredited story that finally brought him down.”",1
210,"Pollak: Prosecution Falters in George Floyd Murder Trial, but Media Prime Public to Expect Conviction","The prosecution suffered a serious setback on Tuesday in the George Floyd murder trial in Minneapolis, Minnesota, when two experts called against Derek Chauvin provided testimony helpful to the defense — though the media reported otherwise.

CNN sent a news alert on Tuesday evening reporting: “Expert testifies Derek Chauvin’s kneeling on George Floyd’s neck isn’t a trained restraint. Another says the arrest was excessive.” The bulk of CNN’s coverage followed the prosecution line.

However, as noted by attorney Andrew Branca at the Legal Insurrection blog (via Scott Adams), the prosecution’s experts provided potentially exculpatory evidence on cross-examination.

The state’s use-of-force training expert, Johnny Mercil, did indeed say that the neck restraint was not a “trained restraint” by the Minneapolis Police Department — but he also said that the use of such a restraint was not necessarily against policy, given a suspect forcibly resisting arrest and under the influence of drugs.

Mercil also conceded that given the threatening behavior of the crowd that had gathered to watch and record the arrest, it might be reasonable not only to maintain a neck restraint, but to wait until medical personnel arrived before giving a suspect first aid.

Branca noted (original emphasis):

Today was a terrible, horrible no good, very bad day for the prosecution, to a degree that I haven’t seen since the trial of George Zimmerman. … Basing your narrative of guilt on only half the context is a dangerous ploy because we, thank God, enjoy an adversarial legal system, and that means the defense gets to pop right up and expose the jury to the other half of the context, the half consistent with a narrative of innocence—and, in this case, they get to do so with your own witness. And that’s precisely what happened with Mercil, and in a big, big way.

The state’s medical expert, Nicole MacKenzie, also admitted on cross-examination that the threatening nature of the crowd would justify delaying medical treatment for the safety of the officers, and that police might have mistaken Floyd’s “atonal breathing” for regular breathing. The defense used her testimony to argue the crowd played a role in Floyd’s death.

None of that means that Chauvin is certain to be acquitted. But the mainstream media coverage is overwhelmingly favorable to the prosecution. That reinforces doubts about whether Chauvin can receive a fair trial, but also suggests the possibility of more public outrage if the jury returns a verdict of not guilty that the media suggest is impossible.

211,Conservatives Dunk On Asa Hutchison for Defense of Child Sex Change Veto,"An online uproar followed Tuesday’s heated exchange between Fox News host Tucker Carlson and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson (R) as the latter defended his recent veto of legislation that would have made Arkansas the first state to ban puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery — for transgender minors.

While Hutchinson claimed he was exercising his belief in a limited role of government while accusing Carlson of misrepresenting the bill, the Fox News host accused the governor of ignorance surrounding the “emerging field” of such treatments.

“It doesn’t sound like you have studied it very deeply,” Carlson said.

The Fox News host also stated that he was “skeptical” over Hutchinson’s assertion that no one affiliated with corporations such as Walmart spoke to the governor about opposition to the legislation.

Hutchinson, a Republican, created an online storm as a result of the bizarre “limited government” defense of his veto, with many right-wing personalities calling it “career-ending.”

“Arkansas Governor @AsaHutchinson just told Tucker Carlson that if Republicans ‘want to broaden the party’ they have to support the chemical castration of children and that’s why he vetoed a bill on transgenderism that restricts chemical and surgical castration of kids,” columnist and political commentator Mollie Hemingway wrote:

“Ada [sic] Hutchinson more or less admitted last week that there is corporate pressure for him to veto bills like the one he did today,” political commentator Ian Miles Cheong wrote. “Completely contradicts what he told Tucker tonight.”

Subsequently, on Tuesday, the Arkansas legislature voted overwhelmingly to override Hutchinson’s veto in a 25-8 vote.

While Democrats and the broader left regularly frame human sexual dimorphism as an arbitrary social construct, many see the frenzied entertaining of children’s curiosity as a form of abuse.

Earlier this week, National Public Radio (NPR) Boston affiliate WBUR aired an interview with a Massachusetts third-grader and his parents describing their experience since being “startled” by their child’s announcement that he feels like a “boy-girl” at the mere age of six. As a result, many listeners took to Twitter to voice their concerns over what they viewed as “child abuse,” with some calling to defund the taxpayer-funded radio network.

In February, former HUD secretary Dr. Ben Carson, a retired pediatric neurosurgeon, described the pushing of left-wing transgender ideology upon children as “child abuse” on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

“Biology tells us that there are males and there are females, and there’s a reason for that, and we also know that the human brain is an incredibly complex organ and it’s not fully developed until your mid-to late-twenties,” Carson said.

“So why would you be asking a pre-adolescent about these complex issues?” Carson asked.

“Why would we even be complicating their lives? Children are curious by nature, and of course, they’re going to ask questions and explore things. That doesn’t mean that they want to change their sex. And to confuse them in that way, I think, is child abuse. It certainly has nothing to do with science. These radical things are actually going to ruin people’s lives long term,” he said.

President Joe Biden recently made history by nominating Rachel Levine, born Richard Levine, as assistant secretary of health, making Levine the highest-ranking openly transgender official in the United States ever.

In 2017, Levine recommended “accelerating” cross-sex hormones for homeless teens who are suffering from gender dysphoria and estranged from their parents.

During Levine’s Senate confirmation hearing last month, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), in reference to Levine’s 2017 statements, asked if Levine supported government intervention to override parental consent to give a child “puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and or amputation surgery of breasts and genitalia.”

Levine refused to answer Paul’s questions, including one asking if Levine believed that “minors are capable of making such a life-changing decision as changing one’s sex.”

212,Pell Critic Says Cardinal Was Victim of ‘Relentlessly Prejudiced’ Media Campaign,"Cardinal George Pell was unjustly tried for sex abuse as a “necessary big scalp for media delectation,” writes Jesuit Father Frank Brennan, a vocal critic of Pell’s.

Having attended parts of his two criminal trials and having studied all the publicly available transcript, “I am convinced of Cardinal Pell’s innocence of the criminal charges he faced,” Father Brennan writes in his book Observations on the Pell Proceedings, to be released Thursday.

“I am convinced the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse failed to accord him natural justice in its pursuit of a necessary big scalp for media delectation,” states Brennan, Rector of Newman College at the University of Melbourne.

Cardinal Pell endured “404 days of wrongful imprisonment, much of it in solitary confinement,” the author notes. “The time has come to attest that Pell worked tirelessly and to the best of his ability from 1996 to put right the dreadful consequences of institutional child sexual abuse.”

Putting aside his ongoing differences with the Australian cardinal, Brennan declares that people must recognize the unfair and shameful manner in which Pell was treated.

“Pell faced charges that should never have been brought, a prosecution that was malicious, a Victorian appeal court that got it very wrong, and a media campaign that was relentlessly prejudiced,” Brennan states.

Cardinal Pell pleaded not guilty to child sexual assault charges in 2018 but the public knew little of the proceedings because the trial judge imposed a suppression order, prohibiting the media from publicizing the evidence and court proceedings, notes the book’s webpage.

The Australian Catholic bishops asked Father Brennan to follow the proceedings and to offer commentary on the conduct of the proceedings once the suppression orders were lifted, and Cardinal Pell granted Brennan access to the published transcript of the proceedings.

Brennan “identifies the failures of the Victoria police, prosecution authorities, and Victoria’s two most senior judges,” the page states, and Brennan concludes that these failures “did nothing to help the efforts being made to address the trauma of institutional child sexual abuse.”

213,"Media Dismissed Trump’s April Vaccine Goal, Now Announced by Biden","President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he was moving up the deadline for all American adults to be eligible for the coronavirus vaccine to April 19 — a deadline the media suggested was impossible when President Donald Trump set it.

In September 2020, during the most intense period of the presidential election, the Washington Post ran the following headline: “Trump says, without evidence, every American will get coronavirus vaccine by April.”

The story covered the fact that Trump had contradicted the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who said that the public was unlikely to have access to the vaccine until the second and third quarter of 2021. Trump said the CDC director misspoke. The episode was portrayed as an example of Trump politicizing science in the pandemic.

The article read (emphasis added):

When Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said earlier in the week that the general public was unlikely to get access to a vaccine until the second and third quarters of 2021, echoing other scientific leaders in the administration, Trump said he’d misspoken.",1
214,Nolte: Disgraced ’60 Minutes’ Stands by Its Debunked Ron DeSantis Hoax,"Although its political assassination attempt against Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) has been thoroughly debunked as a hoax and conspiracy theory, the long-disgraced 60 Minutes is standing by its smoldering pile of fake news.

Over Easter weekend, the long-disgraced 60 Minutes deliberately and falsely accused DeSantis of accepting a $100,000 super PAC contribution from the Publix supermarket chain in exchange for awarding Publix a China virus vaccine contract.

This did not happen. Two Democrat — Democrat! — state officials said so; as did Publix, a regional chain that gives money to both parties — most especially Florida politicians.

Side Note: In Florida, Publix is like the homeless in New York or human feces on the sidewalks of San Francisco or car-jackings in Detroit or hate crimes in Los Angeles… You can’t throw a rock without hitting one.

On top of its pay-for-play lie, the long-disgraced 60 Minutes was also caught deliberately and maliciously editing video of DeSantis to make it look as though he dodged and bulldozed questions 60 Minutes’ far-left correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi asked. After the full video was uncovered, it not only became clear Alfonsi was heckling and taunting DeSantis, but that he answered her questions in detail and to the satisfaction of any reasonable person. This is what the long-disgraced 60 Minutes edited out.

Nevertheless, because the long-disgraced 60 Minutes is not interested in restoring its long lost integrity and is only interested in retaining its status with a left-wing corporate media cult that will not brook any kind of honesty that might benefits its enemies on the right, in a statement released to Fox News Tuesday, the long-disgraced 60 Minutes stood by its proven lies:

When Florida state data revealed people of color were vaccinated at a much lower rate than their wealthier neighbors, ‘60 Minutes’ reported the facts surrounding the vaccine’s rollout, which is controlled by the governor. We requested and conducted interviews with dozens of sources and authorities involved. We requested an interview with Gov. Ron DeSantis, he declined; we spoke to State Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz twice, but he declined to be interviewed on camera for our story until well after our deadline. The idea we ignored their perspective is untrue. Counter to his statement yesterday, we also spoke on the record with Palm Beach County Mayor David Kerner… Our story Sunday night speaks for itself.

And yet both Moskowitz and Kerner — who are both Democrats — slammed the story as a bald-faced lie.

This statement, of course, is also a lie of omission. The premise of the story is that DeSantis is guilty of pay-for-play with Publix when the facts prove (remember when the media were interested in facts? — yeah, me neither) DeSantis had nothing to do with choosing Publix and that Puiblix throws money at just about everyone.

So what the long-disgraced 60 Minutes did was 1) take a perfectly normal and usual Publix political donation, and 2) a decision DeSantis did not make to give Publix a China virus vaccine contract, to 3) manufacture a steaming pile of fake news.

But even after they have been caught red-handed lying, the long-disgraced 60 Minutes stands by its bald-faced lie, because the corporate media are not about truth and accuracy, the corporate media are only about pushing race-baiting and left-wing propaganda and lying, lying, lying, lying, and then lying some more.

Big kudos to DeSantis for not pulling a Mitt Romney or John McCain (who was a war hero). DeSantis instead refused to sit down with the long-disgraced 60 Minutes, because he knew they were only out to destroy him. This was an excellent piece of judgment and we need more Republican politicians willing to admit the corporate media are the Woke Gestapo and that doing business with them proves you are either a sellout or a moron.

It is long past time that all of us, not just Republican public officials, IGNORE the fake media. Instead of always reacting to these godforsaken liars, we need to concentrate on getting our own message out, pushing our own narratives.

215,"Arkansas Gov. Hutchinson, FNC’s Carlson Clash over Youth Gender Reassignment Bill Veto","Tuesday, Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-AR) and Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson debated Hutchinson’s decision to veto a bill passed by the Arkansas legislature that would prohibit doctors from prescribing puberty-blocking drugs, which Carlson called chemical castration.

Even though the veto was ultimately overridden, Hutchinson insisted his approach was true to the small-government tenets of the Republican Party.

CARLSON: Well, the legislature in Arkansas recently passed a bill that would ban doctors from prescribing so-called puberty blockers, heavy-duty hormones to children who believe they are transgender. The law also bans surgeons from physical castration of children.

But the Governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson vetoed that bill on Monday. Legislatures in Arkansas just voted to override that veto, which brings us to where we are right now. Asa Hutchinson is the Governor of Arkansas, and he joins us to talk about this story.

Governor, thanks so much for coming on. I really appreciate it in the middle of all this. Now, I think of you as a conservative. Here, you’ve come out publicly as pro-choice on the question of chemical castration of children. What changed?

GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): First of all, your teaser as you led into this program did not accurately represent the bill.

If this had been a bill that simply prohibited chemical castration, I would have signed the bill. But Tucker, as you know, this bill was overbroad. It was extreme. It went far beyond what you just said.

And I made it clear that if this was about prohibiting procedures, sex reassignment surgery, absolutely I would have signed that bill. But this again, is the first law in the nation that invokes the state between medical decisions, parents who consent to that, and the decision of the patient and so this goes way too far, and in fact, it does even have a grandfather clause that those young people that are under hormonal treatments, they have to be cut off from it.

CARLSON: If I could just correct you for a second. This is chemical castration, of course, if you stop puberty and suppress the sex hormones, you’re chemically castrating someone. So our description was correct.

But let me just ask you, I mean, there are all kinds of — we’re talking about minors — children here and there are all kinds of things in Arkansas, kids in every state are not allowed to do: get married, drink a beer, get a tattoo.

Why do you think it’s important for conservatives to make certain that children can block their puberty? Be chemically castrated? Why is that a conservative value, if you would tell us?

HUTCHINSON: Well, first of all, you have parents involved in very difficult decisions. You have physicians that are involved in these decisions. And I go back to William Buckley, I go back to Ronald Reagan, to principles of our party, which believes in a limited role of government.

Are we as a party abandoning a limited role of government and saying, we’re going to invoke the government decision making over and above physicians, over and above healthcare, over and above parents — and saying, you can’t do that. You cannot engage in it.

CARLSON: So you believe it is healthcare? How much — how deeply have you studied this topic? With respect — it doesn’t sound like you’ve studied it very deeply. I mean, this is an emerging field, there’s not a lot of research, but the research that exists suggests that depression and the urge to self-harm and suicide is a component, it is a side-effect of taking these hormones.

A study in the U.K. show the overwhelming majority of kids, of children on puberty-blocking hormones had the urge to hurt themselves. Why is that responsible medicine to do that to children? Why would you support something like that?

HUTCHINSON: Well, I actually reviewed some of that study. I reviewed the High Court decision there, and I think they are different than what you’re talking about here.

Sure, there’s a lot of unknowns here. I studied this bill, in contrast to what you just said. I spend a lot of time reviewing cases, meeting with people, listening to the experts, as well as to faith leaders as well.

And I’m a person of faith. But at the same time, I’m a person of limited role of government. I sign pro-life bills. I signed many bills that would be looked at as a very conservative, but this is one that crosses the line. There’s no need for it and it doesn’t justify itself.

CARLSON: Hold on, I am sorry, but hold on. You just said there is no need for it, but you just said — you said that you’ve seen research that shows the mental health of children who receive puberty-blocking drugs improves – – what is that research exactly?

HUTCHINSON: Well, the research that I’ve seen shows that these troubled youth, these ones that have gender dysphoria, that they also have depression, they have suicidal tendencies. It’s a higher suicide rate than others.

CARLSON: Yes.

HUTCHINSON: And they go to their parents, the parents go to doctors, and they try to deal with is very difficult issue.

I don’t think we should deny them healthcare.

CARLSON: But do those symptoms improve — hold on, wait. Hold on. I’m sorry, I’m sorry. You’re the Governor. You just vetoed this bill, you said you’re familiar with the studies. No one disputes that children who were asking for puberty-blocking drugs or have been recommended their parents or doctors, may be depressed. That seems very likely, I think the studies show it.

Cite one specific study that shows puberty-blocking drugs improves the condition. Does it make children less depressed? Does it make them less likely to harm themselves to commit suicide? Just name one study that shows that, please?

HUTCHINSON: Well, I would refer you to the “American Academy of Pediatrics.” I would refer you to the physicians that came out in opposition to this bill because they understood the risk to these young people. And if you prohibit the medical care that this bill prohibits, then you’re going to endanger these young people even further.

So I would cite all of those medical experts —

CARLSON: But how do we know that? Hold on. This field barely existed 10 years ago. Cases of gender dysphoria, so-called, have increased by thousands of percent in the last decade.

So actually, we can’t know the answers to these questions. The research that we have suggest the opposite of what you’re claiming. You clearly aren’t familiar with the research. And so my question is, have you spoken to any of the biggest employers, the big companies in Arkansas about this?

Have you taken any calls from Tyson’s? From Dillard? From Walmart? Has anyone from those companies called you about this bill?

HUTCHINSON: No, but Tucker, you’re saying, first of all, there are no studies —

CARLSON: You haven’t spoken to one corporate interest.

HUTCHINSON: And then you cite the study.

CARLSON: No, no. There is — hey, there is not a single study that I’m aware of, that shows an improvement in the mental health of children who take puberty blockers, who are chemically castrated, and you couldn’t cite one.

You’re not familiar with their research. You were told by doctors that it’s a good idea and you went with it. But I just want to clarify very quickly, have you — and I just want to be clear on this. Have you spoken to any corporate interest in the State of Arkansas about this bill?

HUTCHINSON: Tucker, I answered that. I answered that question. And I said, no, I have not.

CARLSON: Okay.

HUTCHINSON: Do you have another question?

CARLSON: I’m skeptical because we’ve certainly seen across the —

HUTCHINSON: Tucker —

CARLSON: Let me just say, Governor, with respect I’m skeptical that not a single corporation in the State of Arkansas has weighed in with you one way or the other on this bill. I am — I’m skeptical. I suppose, I have —

HUTCHINSON: You asked me if I talked to them. I said, I hadn’t.

Let me emphasize, Tucker, you are a conservative, you have a great background in that. Where are we getting back to the limited role of government that we don’t have to invoke ourselves in every societal position out there? Let’s limit the role of government. Let’s let parents and doctors make decisions.

CARLSON: And then why don’t we allow 18-year-olds to drink beer in Arkansas? Why don’t we allow them to get tattoos? Why don’t we allow 15- year-olds to get married?

You’re allowing — you vetoed a bill that would have protected children, not adults, children, to whom a different standard applies from a life altering permanent procedure that has effects we can only guess that but the early indication is they’re very serious and very negative in some cases.

And now you’re telling me you do that because you’re a friend of limited government? Okay, then why are we preventing kids from drinking? Sincere question — or getting married? Sincere question. Having sex? They’re not old enough to have sex, but they’re old enough to be chemically castrated? How does that work exactly? I’ll listen, as you explain.

HUTCHINSON: Well, thank you, Tucker. And first of all, these are difficult decisions. Do you want to listen to the medical profession? Do you want to listen to professional counselors? Do you want to listen to parents? Or do you want to leave all these decisions to the legislators that come from all different kinds of backgrounds? Yes, they’re elected to represent you. But they do not necessarily make the right judgments for parents and for doctors in the most sensitive issues, and so sure, I signed —

CARLSON: They why are we regulating the behavior of children at all, if we’re allowing children to decide? And by the way, I read a study today that showed the overwhelming majority of kids who do not take life-altering hormones, in the end, decide not to, quote, “transition to a new sex.”

So there’s a lot going on here, but I’m asking, as a conservative you just incited — invoked Ronald Reagan as if he were for chemical castration of children. What other behaviors should we not use the power of the state to regulate among kids? Seriously. Why can’t they have sex at 15?

HUTCHINSON: Well, you debate it every time — look, Tucker, you want to keep talking or do you want me to answer a question?

CARLSON: I sincerely want you to answer.

HUTCHINSON: Whenever you — well, thank you. And so whenever you — whether it’s beer for minors, these are all issues that you have to address the legislature. You make judgment calls on it.

But we also try to restrain ourselves as conservatives that we don’t have to be involved in every issue. And if you want to broaden the party, if you want to get back to the principles, then let’s at least think through in a reasoned way as to whether this is the right bill to interfere with parents’ and doctors’ decisions on a healthcare matter, as you pointed out, does not have thorough research in every area.

And so I yield to that. Whatever you look at this bill and my veto of it —

CARLSON: You yield to the lack of research. Really quick, 10 years ago, if somebody had said, Hey, Asa Hutchinson, you’re the Governor of Arkansas, and you’re going to veto a bill that would have protected children from chemical castration. What do you think he would have said?

HUTCHINSON: Well, just like I said, today, if you’re talking about a reassignment surgery, I would have signed that bill in a minute. But whenever you’re talking about maybe less than 200 kids in Arkansas that’s currently on hormone treatment, and they are immediately cut off without having a grandfather clause in his legislation. I don’t think that’s treating those kids or their parents or their healthcare providers fairly or equally.

CARLSON: All right. That’s the conservative position. Governor, thanks. I appreciate coming on.

HUTCHINSON: Thank you.",1
216,FNC’s Carlson: ‘Unequal Treatment Under the Law Is on Stark Display Across the Country Right Now’,"Tuesday, Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson decried the double standard of the law as it was applied to January 6 U.S. Capitol rioters and Black Lives Matter rioters throughout 2020.

Carlson referred to the treatment doled out to individuals who allegedly participated in the Capitol Hill event versus anyone who participated in a BLM protest.

Transcript as follows:

CARLSON: Today is the three-month anniversary of January 6. For those of you who aren’t good at dates or don’t have calendars, this is the day that we pause to remember the white supremacist QAnon insurrection that came so very close to toppling our government and ending this democracy forever.

You saw what happened. It was carried live on television, every gruesome moment, a mob of older people from unfashionable zip codes somehow made it all the way to Washington, D.C., probably by bus.

They wandered freely through the Capitol like it was their building or something. They didn’t have guns, but a lot of them had extremely dangerous ideas. They talked about the Constitution and something called their rights.

Some of them made openly seditious claims. They insisted, for example, that the last election was not entirely fair. The whole thing was terrifying.

And then, as you’ve been told, so very often, they committed unspeakable acts of violence. By the time thousands of soldiers arrived to restore order, an unarmed woman, an Air Force veteran lay dead.

To this day, that woman is the one completely verified casualty of the insurrection, the only person whose death we can say definitively was caused by specific events on January 6. We know how she died.

The funny thing is, you almost never hear that woman’s name. Possibly that’s because she was not a Democratic Member of Congress or even a Joe Biden voter.

She was a protester. Her name was Ashli Babbitt. She was 35.

We still don’t know who shot Ashli Babbitt or why. No one will tell us. But then when you’re fighting insurrectionists, you don’t have to explain yourself, you just hyperventilate about QAnon and then you do whatever you want.

When a group of sad, disenfranchised people who have been left out of the modern economy show up at your office, you don’t have to listen to their complaints.

Not for a second, why would you? You thought listening to people’s complaints was democracy? No. These people threatened democracy.

You can even shoot one of them if you want and get away with it.

Killing people without explaining yourself is an established part of counterinsurgency. And if you don’t believe it, check out what happened in the Second World War.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): President Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 7, 1941 as a day that will live in infamy. Unfortunately, we can now add January 6, 2021 to that very short list of dates in American history that will live forever in infamy.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: January 6 was Pearl Harbor, says Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer has never really gotten appropriate credit for the grandeur of that statement considering the very next day after Pearl Harbor, we entered the Second World War. That war went on for four years, more than 400,000 Americans died, but that was the cost of stopping fascism.

We don’t yet know the cost of stopping white supremacist QAnon insurrection, but you can be certain that Chuck Schumer is prepared to have you pay whatever it costs.

Joe Biden’s Justice Department is on the front lines of this new war, until late last month, a man called Michael Sherwin who worked for the Biden administration as a prosecutor in Washington.

Sherwin bragged that his office had rounded up about 400 people who are in or near the Capitol on January 6. You may be wondering, did 400 people really commit serious crimes that day?

Well, that depends how you define crime. Listen to Michael Sherwin’s definition.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MICHAEL SHERWIN, INTERIM UNITED STATES ATTORNEY FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA: After the sixth, we had an inauguration on the 20th. So I wanted to ensure, and our office wanted to ensure that there was shock and awe that we could charge as many people as possible before the 20th, and it worked, because we saw through media posts that people were afraid to come back to D.C. because they’re like, if we go there, we’re going to get charged.

We wanted to take out those individuals that essentially were thumbing their noses at the public for what they did.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Oh, so now it’s clear. It wasn’t that 400 people broke actual laws. No, their crime says the Federal prosecutor was, quote, “thumbing their noses at the public,” meaning the Democratic Party.

So it wasn’t really an insurrection. The problem was they showed disrespect to Joe Biden and his enforcers like Michael Sherwin and that can’t happen anymore.

And that’s why Michael Sherwin decided to use shock and awe to teach them a very nasty lesson, a permanent lesson about expressing their political opinions in public.

As Michael Sherwin explained, quote, “The scope and scale of this investigation are really unprecedented, not only in FBI history, but probably DOJ history.”

And he may be right. How big, how serious is this investigation to those insurrectionists? So serious that the FBI has stopped investigating other crimes and not minor crimes.

According to “USA Today,” quote, “Investigators who typically work cases involving the trafficking of drugs, child pornography and sex, have taken calls from rioters, angry ex-wives and former girlfriends and employers turned tipsters.”

Oh, so in order to stop people who might express unacceptable political ideas in Washington, D.C., we’re not going after people who sell fentanyl for example, killed over a hundred thousand Americans or child pornographers. They won’t be punished.

So who are these people who are being pursued in lieu of tracking down fentanyl dealers and child pornographers? Who is experiencing the administration shock and awe?

Well, people like Anthony Alfred Griffith of Oklahoma. Griffith didn’t throw fire bombs at police cars. He didn’t loot anything. He didn’t torch a Wendy’s. He did something far worse than that. Here’s what he did.

According to KFOR TV, quote: “Griffith walked into the U.S. Capitol Building through the open doors on January 6, telling the agents he did not see any police officers as he entered the building. He then went to a nearby office where he interacted with some individuals before exiting the building. However, he re-entered the U.S. Capitol Building again a short time later where he meandered through the hallways and took a few photos,” end quote.

“He meandered through the hallways,” if you can imagine. And for that act of terrorism, Anthony Griffith faces seven years in prison.

Prosecutor Michael Sherwin is fine with that. At one point, in a “60 Minutes,” interview, Sherwin was asked about bringing sedition charges against the people he arrests, people who meander.

Well, of course, sure, he said, why not?

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

SCOTT PELLEY, “60 MINUTES” CORRESPONDENT: Sedition occurs when anyone opposes by force the authority of the United States or by force, hinders or delays the execution of any law of the United States.

Do you anticipate sedition charges against some of these suspects?

SHERWIN: I believe the facts do support those charges, and I think that as we go forward, more facts will support that, Scott.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Yes, “meandering is sedition,” says Michael Sherwin.

Now just for reference, federal prosecutors typically aren’t supposed to reveal their partisan lunatics on television. Sherwin’s comments were so grotesquely out of line that a Federal Judge appointed by Barack Obama, Amit Mehta said he was considering issuing a gag order to make Michael Sherwin be quiet and stop saying the quiet part out loud.

The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the most powerful Appellate Court in the country just ordered the DOJ to start distinguishing between actual criminals and people who walk through open doors inside the Capitol Building. That ruling came after the DOJ tried to convince the Judge that two defendants, Lisa Eisenhart, and her son, Eric Munchel, should face indefinite detention.

Now, neither Lisa Eisenhart nor her son damaged any property at the Capitol or committed any violence. They just walked in to what we used to refer to as the People’s House. And yet somehow, Joe Biden’s Department of Justice convinced a trial judge that Lisa Eisenhart was a quote, “threat to our Republic,” and that her son was a quote, “would-be martyr.”

Keep in mind, these are people whose crime was trespassing in the Capitol. We’re not endorsing that, but some perspective, please.

It took a ruling from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to bring that perspective, quote: “Two individuals who did not engage in any violence and were not involved in planning or coordinating the activities seemingly would pose little threat.” The Appellate panel wrote. Yes, seemingly.

But the judges still didn’t release Eric Munchel or his mother, Lisa Eisenhart. That’s how much power federal prosecutors have. They can keep you in prison even when a three-judge Appellate panel concludes there is no reason for you to be in prison, and that’s probably why prosecutors still have not, as of tonight, released a man called Jacob Chansley, otherwise known as the Chewbacca guy. You may remember him.

Like Eric Munchel and his mother, Lisa Eisenhart, Jacob Chansley is not accused of committing any act of violence. He is not accused of breaking any property. So what exactly did he do?

Well, we can actually answer that question because it’s on video.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

JACOB CHANSLEY, SELF-STYLED QANON SHAMAN: Hey. Hey [bleep], man, glad to see you guys. You guys are [bleep] patriots. Look at this guy, he has got – – you’re covered in blood. God bless you.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You hurt, sir? Do you need medical attention?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I’m good. Thank you.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All right.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I got shot in the face — I got shot in the face with some kind of plastic bullet.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Any chance I could get you guys to leave the Senate wing?

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We will. I’ve been making sure they ain’t disrespecting the place.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, just wanted to let you guys know, this is like the sacredest place.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I know.

CHANSLEY: I know.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Yes, he’s a threat to the Republic — got an American flag and all. Chewbacca guy is still in jail. He’ll be there indefinitely.

Before you shrug that off, think about what that’s actually like. You don’t want to think about it.

Tonight, we learned that a number of people arrested on January 6 are still rotting in the D.C. jail, municipal lockup. That’s one of the foulest places in this country. It’s a truly repulsive and mismanaged place. Ask anyone from Washington, D.C.

What would you do not to be thrown into the D.C. jail? It’s that bad.

Some of the people held from January 6, they’ve been beaten not surprisingly, by guards. They are beaten badly.

Lawyers for one man, a man called Ryan Samsel say he was beaten by guards so badly he has a skull fracture and he is now blind in one eye.

How many Antifa rioters or BLM vandals can say that? Do they lose their eyesight from being beaten in jail? Well, as a group, they didn’t spend much time in jail actually. Most were sprung on bail immediately when politicians like Kamala Harris helped them pay to get out.

Last summer for example, authorities released a terrorism suspect in Oklahoma called Eric Christopher Ruffin, after Black Lives Matter posted his $750,000.00 bond. According to authorities, Ruffin, quote: “Encouraged others to burn an Oklahoma County Sheriff’s van and Oklahoma City Bail Bonds business, May 30th.” The van was destroyed. The bail bondsman had $8,850.00 in damage from broken windows.

But Eric Christopher Ruffin went home and he went home for one reason. Unlike the Chewbacca guy, he did not upset the people in charge. He didn’t walk in their Sacred Chamber, talk about liberty and rights. He just tried to vaporize some police vehicles, and that’s exactly what our political class wanted him to do. So he’s a hero. He’s fine tonight.

He hasn’t lost his eyesight getting a beating in the D.C. jail.

This kind of thing: unequal treatment under the law is on stark display across the country right now. We could spend an hour giving you examples. Here are a couple.

On Saturday, police say a criminal released on emergency coronavirus bail stabbed an elderly Asian woman to death in Riverside, California. The suspect is called Darlene Montoya. She was in jail for a very serious crime. She’d been accused of assault with a deadly weapon. But is that really as serious as meandering through the Capitol Building? No, come on. It’s not insurrection.

So Darlene Montoya got to walk out of jail and find someone else to hurt.

In December, a New York judge released a murder suspect called Jordan Benjamin just in time for Benjamin to go out and allegedly stab a woman in the stomach. Jordan Benjamin then got out of jail again — again.

Meanwhile, in the City of Detroit, a judge decided to release four felons who have been convicted of criminal sexual assault and another 14 people who’ve committed assault. The judge said that coronavirus justified their release.

Well, according to prosecutors, one of those felons went out and raped three women at knifepoint.

Why haven’t you read this? Nobody covers it. It happens too often to notice.

But in March, one of those murders were caught on video. And so you may have seen this. It was impossible to ignore. It happened in Washington, D.C. Two teenage girls, one 15 and one, 13, carjacked and then killed a Pakistani immigrant driver called Mohammad Anwar. You had a bunch of kids just trying to work, trying to make a buck.

As Anwar lay dying on the sidewalk– and this gives you a sense of where these girls are coming from — one of them complained that the real crisis was she couldn’t find her cell phone.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God. She’s still their car.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: She’s stealing the car.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, we called the cops. We called the cops.

[CRASH]

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They stole the car. These girls stole the car.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh my God. Oh my God.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Come out. Come out.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, they stole the car. They stole the car. These girls.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those girls.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That’s it. That’s it. That’s it. That’s it.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: My phone.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody step back. I am going to need everybody to step back from the car.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please. My phone is in there. My phone. My phone.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: So you kill a guy, who is just trying to work, and then you can’t even be bothered to notice as he dies in the sidewalk because you’re worried about your phone. There’s a big problem with these girls. They’re young, for sure. But they did something awful. They’re not being treated that way. They got a plea deal.

According to news accounts, they will be released as soon as they turn 21, maybe earlier.

There’s a good chance that Chewbacca guy will spend more time in jail for trespassing with an American flag than the people who killed Mohammad Anwar will spend for murder.

And that’s not an accident, actually, this disproportionate treatment of crimes. If you’re an autocrat, the biggest threat isn’t people who commit actual violence, you can use them as your shock troops and people who run our country certainly have.

The biggest threat to you if you’re an autocrat is people who mock you and don’t take you seriously and sneer at you. You want them in prison and they’re putting them up in prison.",1
217,CNN’s Lemon: ‘King of Cancel Culture’ Trump Was ‘Cancelled’ by the Voters,"CNN anchor Don Lemon said Tuesday on his show “Tonight” that former President Donald Trump was the “king of cancel culture” because the voters canceled him.

Discussing the new Georgia voting law, Lemon said, “The former president, you know, you knew he would get in the middle of this, didn’t you? Putting out a statement complaining about woke cancel culture in all caps. In case you might have missed it, and our sacred elections, and another calling for a boycott of baseball and what he calls all of the woke companies that are interfering with free and fair elections. Are you listening, Coke, Delta, and all? Boohoo cancel culture.”

He continued, “Okay. Again, you’ve got to watch this because this is from the king, as we say, the ‘kang’ where I’m from, of cancel culture. Calling for Democrats calling for boycotts of companies that offend them. I give you the king of cancel culture who got it in another dig at Major League Baseball today. Here it is.”

In a Newsmax video, Trump said, “You know, look, I’m just not very interested in baseball for the last number of years. I think it’s not appropriate. You know, you look — you want to find a game, it’s on every channel, and yet you can’t find anything. The weirdest thing. It used to be a nice, easy thing to follow. You know what I mean by that. It was on one network, and it was nice and good and beautiful. Today you don’t even know what the hell you are watching. So I would say boycott baseball. Why not?”

Lemon said, “The king of cancel culture can add that to his list, okay? Because there is Coke, there’s Delta. There is Major League Baseball. There is more from the king of cancel culture. There is Rolling Stone. There is — I mean, there is too much. I can’t even fit it on the screen. There is HBO. There is Apple. There’s Macy’s, Univision, Fox News, AT&T, the NFL, there is Harley-Davidson, there is Nike, Starbucks, Goodyear, Comcast, T-Mobile, Geico, Oreo, Mexico, The Wall Street Journal editorial board, NBC, even Glenfiddich Whisky.”

He added, “Who was canceled? Not by cancel culture, but by what? The voters. The hypocrisy and the double-speak and the shiny objects and the lying continues.”

218,MSNBC’s Melber: Biden Increasingly Liberal — He Sounds Like ‘The New Bernie’,"MSNBC anchor Ari Melber said Tuesday on “The Beat” that President Joe Biden was governing to the left and “at times, can sound a bit like” progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).

Melber said, “Joe Biden has begun his presidency on a more liberal footing than the last two Democratic presidents, which makes this the most progressive start to any presidency in the past 40 years. Biden is now pushing for a cumulative $4 trillion in total spending in his first 100 days. Getting a liberal boost from the news Senate Democrats can bypass McConnell’s obstruction for party-line votes on the new infrastructure bill. Liberals are encouraged. Conservatives are aghast. Many Democrats who know Joe Biden are struck by how he’s evolving in this role and in this tough time for the nation, a contrast to a Senate career where he was, by his own words, a centrist or even conservative Democrat on many different issues.”

He continued, “Biden is governing from the core and base of the Democratic Party, the progressive base, pushing the liberal plans I just mentioned, spending that outstrips anything from the early days of the Obama-Biden administration, higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Joe Biden taking sides with labor more than he did in past decades, or then past Democratic presidents. He’s pushing the new multi-trillion plan with major planks for jobs, racial justice, and addressing climate change. Now whether it’s correlation or causation, Biden at times can sound a bit like the new Bernie.”

He added, “Is Biden simply revealing his own values now that he has this power? Or is he channeling Sanders?”

219,"CNN Admits Crime Wave, Highlights Violence in Democrat-Run Cities","CNN admits a crime wave which was evident in 2020 is continuing in 2021 in Democrat-run cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, and others.

According to CNN, Chicago “homicides are up 33 percent in the first three months of the year compared to 2020.” Homicides in NYC were “jumped by nearly 14 percent through March 28” of this year and L.A. homicides rose almost 36 percent through March 30, 2021.

Moreover, the death and mayhem currently afoot in Chicago, N.Y.C., and L.A., comes on the heels of a 2020 in which all three cities “saw significant increases” in homicides over 2019.

For example, on December 29, 2020, New York Magazine noted the city had witnessed 447 homicides to that point in 2020. That was a “41 percent increase over 2019.” And the Los Angeles Daily News noted that L.A. hit 297 homicides by November 20, 2020, “up from 237 by that date in 2019.”

On November 23, 2020, the Chicago Sun-Times pointed out that the city “[had] seen a 53% increase in shootings and murders this year compared to the same period in 2019.”

CNN indicates that the killing continues even now.

220,MSNBC’s Wallace: Alien Who Landed in America Would Think GOP Most ‘Destructive Force on Our Planet’,"MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace said on Tuesday on her show “Deadline” that if an alien landed in America seeking the most destructive force on the planet, they would look to the Republican Party.

Wallace brought up vaccine hesitancy after President Joe Biden’s address on Tuesday, noting there are people hesitant about getting the vaccination for different reasons.

On coronavirus vaccination hesitancy, Dr. Kavita Patel said, “We need to get into parts of Florida, Michigan, Massachusetts, with people who are saying no way,”

Wallace said, “When is someone in the Republican Party going to rise up against those in the Republican Party whose speech and language and selection of debates are still killing people? I mean, choosing to have a debate about vaccine passports in all states where they are aggressively advocating for voter IDs for laws that require IDs is such flagrant hypocrisy. It would be funny if it didn’t have such deadly consequences.”

RealClearPolitics editor A.B. Stoddard said, “I think they’re looking for a new boogeyman, which is definitely Dr. Fauci, and then leaning into the fights over lockdowns and freedoms, which will help Ron DeSantis run for president in 2024. It’s also part of the culture war that the government is out to oppress people, and they’re going to lock you down. You’ll be forced to have a vaccine and have a passport, and that’s just the first step of taking over your whole life.”

Wallace said, “The war against science. I think if someone were to parachute down here and wonder what the most sort of destructive force on our planet is, and they landed in this country, they might look at the Republicans. To me, it feels arbitrary. I’m sure it has long roots in their wars against climate science and their wars against reproductive freedom.”

221,Ron DeSantis: ’60 Minutes’ Report was a ‘Piece of Horse Manure’,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Tuesday ripped CBS News’ 60 Minutes report accusing him of wrongdoing regarding his state’s vaccine rollout, calling it a “piece of horse manure.”

Governor @RonDeSantisFL Blasts 60 Minutes & Corporate Media ""They cut out everything that showed that their narrative was a piece of horse manure."" ""I know corporate media thinks that they can just run over people, you ain't running over this Governor. I'm punching back."" pic.twitter.com/EpZYW3PwYU — The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle) April 6, 2021

A transcript is as follows:

GOV. RON DESANTIS: They cut out everything that showed that their narrative was a piece of horse manure. And it shows you how dishonest — These are smear merchants. That’s why nobody trusts corporate media. They are a disaster in what they are doing. They knew what they were doing was a lie. I knew what they were doing was a lie. Everybody here knows what they were doing was a lie. They know that we know that they’re lying and yet they continue to lie. And they lied, and they lied, and they lied.

We offered them the information and they declined to interview the key people because they didn’t want to let go of the narrative. Well, guess what? There’s going to be consequences for that. I know corporation media thinks they can run over people, you ain’t running over this governor. I’m punching back and I’m going to continue to do it until this smear merchants are held accountable.",1
222,Nolte: Disgraced ’60 Minutes’ ‘Goes Dark’ with Debunked Ron DeSantis Hoax,"60 Minutes, the long-disgraced television news magazine at far-left CBS, has “gone dark” with a now-debunked hoax it launched to smear Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), per Fox News.

The story falsely claimed DeSantis was involved in a pay-for-play scheme with Publix supermarkets involving a contract to distribute the China Virus vaccine.

Within hours, however, the hit piece had been exposed as hoax. Not only did Publix push back against the long-disgraced 60 Minutes, so did two Florida Democrats. On top of that, full video of DeSantis answering a question from a 60 Minutes correspondent proved the long-disgraced outlet had indeed disgraced itself yet again by editing the video in a way that was not only malicious, but meant to misinform anyone still stupid enough to watch the long-disgraced fake news show.

This is likely why, as reported by Fox News, the far-left CBS News entirely ignored the story Monday:

CBS appears to be distancing itself from a “60 Minutes” report that has been widely criticized as a “hit piece” against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, by members of both parties. … The next day, however, there was no mention of the “60 Minutes” report on “CBS This Morning” or the “CBS Evening News,” according to Grabien transcripts.

This development is actually a surprise that suggests after decades of deliberately misleading the American people by way of fake news, fake political polls, and outright disinformation, CBS might be embarrassed by just how red-handed it got caught manufacturing this audacious lie.

Shame is not something we’ve come to expect from outlets such as CBS News. The corporate media usually doubles and triples down on its hoaxes and lies.

But it may be too soon to suggest CBS News is feeling some sort of shame or embarrassment. The long-disgraced 60 Minutes could double and triple down in the coming days.

Regardless, it is highly unlikely that what should happen at CBS News will happen, which is this… A news outlet interested in regaining some of its long lost credibility would retract the story entirely. Then, Gov. DeSantis would receive a full-throated apology from the fake news outlet. Then, everyone involved in the story, most especially 60 Minutes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi, would be named and face serious disciplinary consequences for their deliberate effort to spread disinformation.

As far as those of us with an IQ above room temperature, we all knew this story was a hoax just as soon as it aired. We knew it because all the corporate media do is lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, and then lie some more and then lie some more.

The corporate media are lying liars who no one should be paying any attention to anymore.

223,Shannon Sharpe: ‘I’m So Proud of the MLB’ for Punishing Georgia — Other Red States ‘off the List’,"Fox Sports 1 “Undisputed” co-host Shannon Sharpe on Monday commended Major League Baseball’s decision to move its All-Star Game and Draft out of Atlanta over Georgia’s new election law. The game has since been moved to Colorado.

Sharpe said he is “so proud of the MLB” for punishing Georgia economically for passing the new law to shore up election integrity and pushed other organizations to pull their events out of Georgia until something gets changed. He said other conservative states with similar laws should be “off the list.”

“I like the move by MLB. I like they’re taking a stand,” Sharpe stated. “And Skip, at some point in time, you’re going to have to put action to your words. You say you’re about inclusion; you say you’re about doing the right thing — at some point in time, you have to … put those words into action. And that’s what they’re doing, Skip. Now, you’re going to be relegated to where you can take this game to because there’s a lot of other states that are doing the exact same thing as Georgia — Texas, Florida. So, Florida, you’re off the list. Texas, you’re off the list. There’s a lot of states that are doing the exact same thing that Georgia did.”

He later added after arguing Republicans want it easier to own a gun than vote, “I’m glad MLB did it. I wish — look, the Masters is next weekend. It’s too hard to pull that out. But I wish the SEC Championship says as long as y’all got this, we’re not coming back to Georgia.”

224,Recently Captured Gulf Cartel Boss Was a Mexican Border City Cop,"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas – The recent capture of a top leader within the Gulf Cartel sparked controversy after a collection of documents revealed he was either a current or a former local police officer. The revelation has led to finger-pointing weeks before Mexico’s federal elections this coming summer.

This week, Breitbart Texas broke the story and published an exclusive photograph of Evaristo “Vaquero” Cruz Sanchez’s after his arrest in Nuevo Leon. Vaquero was the elusive leader of the Matamoros faction of the Gulf Cartel. Breitbart Texas also published information provided from U.S. law enforcement sources that revealed officials targeted Vaquero for his role in using cartel funds to finance political campaigns. Authorities also arrested Raul Cantu de La Garza, a candidate with the Movimiento Ciudadano Party, in Nuevo Leon. Authorities also detained a drug lord tied to Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion named Santiago “El Chago” Villarreal. It remains unclear if authorities released him or if he was able to bribe his way to freedom.

In the aftermath, news outlets in Mexico published documents revealing that El Vaquero was a police officer in Matamoros. Outlets reported that Vaquero was hired by current Matamoros Mayor Mario “La Borrega” Lopez, who hails from the MORENA party, the one founded by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.

In response to the documents, the City of Matamoros held a news conference and released a statement noting that El Vaquero was in fact a police officer but had been hired during the previous administration of Jesus de la Garza Dias del Guante from the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI). According to the statement, Vaquero did not work as a cop under the current administration.

Editor’s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used. Breitbart Texas’ Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish. This article was written by “J.A. Espinoza” and “J.C. Sanchez” from Tamaulipas.",1
225,EXCLUSIVE: Gulf Cartel Boss Arrested for Allegedly Funding Mexican Border State Political Candidates,"Though Mexico’s government remains tight-lipped about the arrest of a top leader with the Gulf Cartel, Breitbart Texas exclusively confirmed the elusive figure’s downfall was due in part to his suspected involvement in political campaign financing.

Breitbart Texas broke the news and published an exclusive photograph on Tuesday after Mexico’s military arrested Evaristo “El Vaquero” Cruz Sanchez, the leader of the Matamoros faction of the Gulf Cartel and responsible for much of the violence in northeastern Tamaulipas and sections of San Luis Potosi. The arrest took place in Nuevo Leon, where Vaquero kept a low profile away from the authorities hunting him in Matamoros.

Breitbart Texas learned that Mexico’s government targeted El Vaquero over his alleged use of proceeds from fuel theft schemes to fund political campaigns. Mexico is expected to hold congressional and gubernatorial elections this summer.

A U.S. law enforcement official operating in Mexico told Breitbart Texas that several weeks before the arrest, there was to be a meeting between a top leader with the Gulf Cartel and a figure from the Movimiento Ciudadano Party in Monterrey. Mexican federal agents and the military were expected to raid the rendezvous point, however, the meeting was canceled at the last minute. Mexican authorities are also believed to be documenting other cases where the Gulf Cartel funds local candidates in border cities, the law enforcement source revealed.

Mexican officials then learned of another meeting that would take place this week and sent a group of agents with the organized crime unit SEIDO to Nuevo Leon, where they worked with the Mexican Army to carry out the raid in Salinas Victoria. After getting a positive ID on El Vaquero, military forces stormed the location where the crime boss was meeting with Santiago “El Chago” Villarreal, a former member of Los Zetas who was arrested in 2009 and is currently connected to both the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas and the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion. Authorities have not revealed any information about Villarreal’s status.

Authorities did confirm the detention of Raul Cantu de la Garza from the Movimiento Ciudadano, who is listed as a mayoral candidate for Salinas Victoria. Authorities have not charged Cantu de la Garza, but they raided his home.

226,Migrant Apprehensions Jump 72 Percent in One Month — Up 450 Percent from Last March,"Border Patrol agents apprehended nearly 170,000 migrants in March who illegally crossed the border into the United States. This represents an increase of nearly 72 percent in one month.

During the month of March, Border Patrol agents took 168,195 migrants after they illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico according to the Southwest Land Border Encounters report released on Thursday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

“CBP has experienced an increase in encounters and arrests. This is not new. Encounters have continued to increase since April 2020, and our past experiences have helped us be better prepared for the challenges we face this year,” said CBP Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner Troy Miller in a written statement. “We are committed to balancing the need to maintain border security, care for those in our custody, and keep the American people and our workforce safe.”

While Miller says this is “not new,” it is exponential unprecedented growth as indicated by the blue line in the following CBP chart.

During the first two full months of the Biden Administration (Feb-Mar), agents apprehended nearly 210,000 migrants. This compares to just over 280,000 during the last four months of the Trump administration combined.

CBP reports apprehending 30,389 migrants in March 2020. The March 2021 apprehension of 168,195 represents an increase of more than 450 percent over last year. Compared to the 2019 migrant border crisis, the apprehensions sat at 92,833.

Last month, agents apprehended 18,663 Unaccompanied Alien Children (up from 9,271 in February), 52,904 Family Unit Aliens (up from 19,286), and 96,628 Single Adults (up from 68,992).

The Rio Grande Valley Sector continues to lead the nine southwest border sectors with 159,470 apprehensions so far this fiscal year (which began on October 1, 2020). This represents an increase of 243 percent compared to FY2020 year-to-date statistics.

227,EXCLUSIVE: Gulf Cartel Boss Arrested in Mexican Border State Raid,"Mexican military forces arrested a top leader within the Gulf Cartel. The collar comes as the organization works to provide financial support to political candidates in the northern border region, U.S. law enforcement sources tell Breitbart Texas.

Known as “El Vaquero,” Evaristo Cruz Sanchez is the current leader of the Matamoros faction of the Gulf Cartel and is linked to violence throughout northeastern Tamaulipas.

The raid took place on Tuesday at noon in Salinas Victoria, a short distance from the Monterrey Metropolitan area in Nuevo Leon, a U.S. law enforcement source tells Breitbart Texas. Mexican intelligence forces were tracking Vaquero after he surfaced in Nuevo Leon. The crime boss was trying to keep a low profile and switched safe houses regularly. El Vaquero sought refuge in Monterrey after military forces and the National Guard started hunting him in Tamaulipas, the law enforcement source revealed.

Mexican military forces arrested El Vaquero as he was meeting with a man known only as “El Chago” Villarreal, a local crime boss and former member of Los Zetas. He now supports Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion. According to the U.S. law enforcement source, the two drug figures met to discuss the financing of political campaigns in northern Mexico.

228,Drones Lead to Arrests of 450 Hiding Migrants near Border in Texas,"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents utilizing Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) drones apprehended more than 450 migrants in the past two weeks.

A video tweeted by Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero shows a group of migrants running through the brush. The group appears to hunker down to avoid detection by Border Patrol agents.

The integration of #technology into border security continues to yield impressive results. Our sUAS pilots routinely assist fellow agents to quickly and safely apprehend groups hiding in the brush. These ‘drones’ have assisted in over 450 apprehensions in the past two weeks. pic.twitter.com/EtXv8wadeL — Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero (@USBPChiefDRT) April 7, 2021

With the use of the sUAS drones, monitoring agents are able to clearly see the location of the hiding migrants and direct ground teams to make the arrest.

Skero stated the sUAS teams led agents to apprehend more than 450 migrants during a two-week period.

In February, Breitbart Texas reported agents in the neighboring Laredo Sector were also utilizing the sUAS technology to apprehend migrants on expansive ranchlands. In one incident, agents observed a group of 70 migrants crossing the Rio Grande in an area where no physical barrier exists. Horseback-mounted agents tracked down the migrants and placed them under arrest.

The operation of sUAS vehicles is not unique to South Texas Border Patrol operations. Earlier in February, sUAS pilots in the Yuma Sector utilized the drone’s technology to locate three migrants hiding in the thick brush along the roadway, Chief Patrol Agent Chris Clem tweeted. The pilot directed the Border Patrol agent directly to the migrants’ hiding spot where he was able to place them in custody.

229,276 Migrants Apprehended in Two Groups Crossing Border into Texas,"Rio Grande Valley Sector agents apprehended two large groups of migrants at separate locations along the Texas-Mexico border. The near-simultaneous crossings resulted in the apprehension of 276 migrants, including family units and unaccompanied minors.

Rio Grande City Station Border Patrol agents working the Rio Grande near Roma, Texas, on Tuesday received information about a large group crossing the border, according to information obtained from Border Patrol officials. As the agents arrived on the scene, they observed a group of 145 migrants who had just crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico.

Rio Grande City Border Patrol agents apprehended 2 groups totaling 276 illegal aliens. The groups crossed the Rio Grande almost simultaneously, over 30 miles apart. The majority consisting of family members and unaccompanied children. Read more about it: https://t.co/IClsWQRCoC pic.twitter.com/Y2ATVTzBbH — Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings (@USBPChiefRGV) April 7, 2021

During processing, agents categorized the group as containing 121 family members and 24 unaccompanied minors.

At nearly the same time, another group of Rio Grande City agents encountered a group of 131 migrants. Officials reported this group consisted of 99 family units, 28 Unaccompanied Alien Children, and four single adults.

The 276 migrants in total were transported to Border Patrol facilities for processing, background investigations, and medical screenings. In some cases, migrant families and single adults can be expelled under Title 42 coronavirus protection protocols put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“The groups crossed the Rio Grande almost simultaneously, over 30 miles apart,” Rio Grande Valley Sector Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings said in a Twitter post. “The majority consisting of family members and unaccompanied children.”

Border Patrol officials in the Rio Grande Valley Sector reported the apprehension of 35 large migrant groups so far this year. Border Patrol defines “large groups” as 100 or more migrants.

“Even with the spread of the COVID-19 virus, human smugglers continue to try these brazen attempts with zero regard for the lives they endanger nor to the health of the citizens of our great nation,” Border Patrol officials said in a written statement.",1
230,Clark: Inside the Lost Migrant Recovery Program at the Texas Border,"As South Texas weather climbs to triple digits, the Border Patrol is preparing for a sweltering summer that may bring record deaths and rescues amid the migrant surge.

The Border Patrol is experiencing apprehensions of unaccompanied children, family units, and single adults at levels not seen in more than 15 years.

The Border Patrol’s Missing Migrant Program (MMP) has been under development for more than a decade. Despite the efforts, which have resulted in many success stories, the environment is still perilous. The messaging campaign associated with the program often goes unheeded: the border is not safe, smugglers do not care about your safety, and the risks of crossing rivers and deserts are not worthwhile. The messages have been broadcast in Mexico and Central America for years.

In the vast areas of the Unites States southern border, finding migrants in distress is a daunting task. Border Patrol embarked on an effort to place emergency placards on major trails and landmarks. They are numbered and registered in a database so that a migrant’s location can be quickly ascertained if called in. Thousands of coordinates for power line poles are recorded as well.

On March 17, 2021, a 911 call received in Del Rio, Texas, concerning a lost migrant was resolved when the person happened upon one of the placards. Agents were dispatched and managed to save countless hours of searching—meaning the difference between a rescue and a corpse recovery.

Rescue beacons are also used and feature a push-button notifications to Border Patrol. Many, located on private lands, require consent for installation.

Despite the messaging campaigns, the efforts do not always end in success. The number of rescues and deaths along the border are staggering. Migrants do not have a say in where they cross. Many lack the provisions to make the journey or suffer from health problems that make their trip even more arduous.

Last year, CBP reported more than 5,000 rescues involving migrants along the border. The remains of 248 were recovered during the same time frame. The recovery of a deceased migrant does not signal an end for Border Patrol. The final aspect of the program is to provide closure to families across the globe who have lost loved ones through the identification process.

Identity documents may be found at a recovery location but cannot be trusted as the sole source. Border Patrol trains agents who specialize in macro photography to gather fingerprints when available. Databases are searched domestically and abroad. When remains are badly decomposed, the Missing Migrant Team searches missing person reports and assists local coroners in obtaining DNA from relatives.

When the effort to identify the remains meets with success, foreign consul officers are contacted to assist in returning them to the relatives abroad. In other cases, the results are much grimmer. The remains are handed over to the local authorities for burial in unmarked “pauper” graves, leaving relatives to wonder what exactly happened to their family member.

In Eagle Pass, Texas, the county cemetery has reached capacity. The only available gravesites are reserved for unidentified migrants who perish attempting to cross the border. Their sites bear only a simple wooden cross left to weather and fall over in time.

231,"Two-Year-Old Migrant Child, Parents Rescued from Swift Currents in Texas Border River","Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents rescued a two-year-old child and two parents from the swiftly moving currents of the Rio Grande. Agents found an additional 20 migrants trapped on a small island in the river.

Del Rio Station marine unit agents patrolling the Rio Grande received a call for assistance regarding a group of migrants trapped on an island in the river that separates Texas and Mexico, according to information obtained from Del Rio Sector Border Patrol officials. While en route to the distressed migrants, the agents observed three people in the water.

In back-to-back incidents, a Del Rio Station boat crew rescued a family of 3 struggling in swift water and assisted a group of 20 stranded on a small island. Fortunately, our highly trained agents were on alert, ready to assist those in danger.

Agents stated the three people were struggling to stay afloat in the swiftly moving waters and high winds. The agents moved their boat into position and pulled a man, woman, and small child from the river.

After receiving the group from the river, agents turned the father, mother, and a two-year-old child to the riverbank where ground-based agents took custody of the family. EMS technicians evaluated the migrant family and transported them to the Del Rio Station for processing. The family did not require any medical attention, officials stated.

The marine agents continued to the original group of distressed migrants. The agents found a group of 20 migrants stranded on a small island in the middle of the river. The agents moved the group to the riverbank where agents turned them over to ground-based agents for further evaluation and processing.

“Great work by our agents, who saved three lives and assisted 20 others in a matter of minutes,” said Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Austin L. Skero II. “No matter the situations they may face, our agents are able to quickly adapt, and overcome any challenge as they protect America.”",1
232,Two Migrant Children Abandoned by Smugglers Found in California Wilderness near Border,"San Diego Sector Border Patrol agents found two small children after human smugglers abandoned them near Jacumba, California. The children were alone and crying when agents found them.

Agents patrolling the border near Jacumba observed a man and woman walking along the Mexican side of the border. The agents continued watching the couple who also had two small children with them, according to information obtained from San Diego Sector Border Patrol officials.

Yesterday afternoon, #BorderPatrol agents rescued 2 siblings, ages 5 & 6, who were abandoned by smugglers in a remote area along the U.S./Mexico Border. Their mother’s phone number was written on the children’s forearms.

The agents observed the couple hoisting two children over large boulders in an area where the border wall ends. The side of the mountain abuts the large boulders.

Agents moved in and found the two children alone and crying. The agents determined the boy to be six years old and the girl to be five years old. The children could not communicate except to provide their names.

Agents transported the children to the station for care and processing. While examining the children, the agents found a handwritten note containing the mother’s name and phone number. The children also had the mother’s phone number and name written on their forearms with a marker.

Following the examination, the agents contacted the mother and obtained additional information about the children. When space becomes available, the children will be turned over to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services officials for temporary housing.

“It is unconscionable that anyone would abandon these small children and those responsible for smuggling events like this will be aggressively prosecuted,” San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Aaron Heitke said in a written statement. “Thankfully, our agents were able to quickly rescue these siblings.”",1
233,"EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Tentacles of Mexican Cartels Reach into U.S., Says Rep. Chip Roy","The tentacles of criminal organizations like the Gulf Cartel or the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas do not end at the Texas border, said U.S. Congressman Chip Roy.

Congressman Roy made those statements during a series of exclusive interviews with Breitbart Texas as he traveled the Texas border in a fact-finding effort amid the current border crisis, which he attributed to the policies of the Biden Administration. Roy stepped away from the formal congressional delegations to border hotspots like McAllen, Laredo, Carrizo Springs, Eagle Pass, and others.

One of the largest takeaways of those visits is that Mexican cartels have real operational control of the border as Mexico’s government remains unable to do anything about it, Roy said.

“That’s something that the American people don’t fully understand,” he said. “The Mexican government–they can’t have their force mean anything in that area. The cartels have control there.”

However, according to Congressman Roy, the power of the cartels does not end at the border. In some cases, U.S. agencies in San Antonio and others have turned a blind eye to the presence and power of cartels, he said.

In the Rio Grande Valley, the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel has been benefiting from the lack of enforcement at the border, while in Laredo the CDN-Los Zetas are the ones reaping the benefits, Roy said.

“They are the ones making a lot of money moving human beings for profit,” he said.

During those visits, Roy has encountered several groups of migrants, some of those who had been trying to run away from authorities such as in Laredo, while in the Rio Grande Valley, migrants became lost in the brush after crossing the river after not being able to find any agents.

“The word has gotten out that Border Patrol is now distracted,” Roy said, explaining that agents from other sectors have been moved to the Rio Grande Valley to man detention and processing facilities. “What does that mean? You don’t have patrols going out and stopping the flow between the ports of entry. So now we have fentanyl up, pounds of marijuana up, human smuggling between ports of entry up, and that is kind of where your bad guys are generally coming. This is the state of our border.”",1
234,Feds Open Two More Unaccompanied Migrant Child Detention Centers in West Texas,"Continuing a recent trend, Health and Human Services (HHS) announced the opening of two more Emergency Intake Sites (EIS) to hold unaccompanied children out of Customs and Border Protection custody.

The move mirrors recent announcements by HHS to address the surge in unaccompanied child migrants (UACs) at the southern border.

New EIS facilities will be located at two existing sites in Dimmit and Pecos Counties, Texas. The sites add capacity to receive another 2,440 minors from Border Patrol facilities. The first UACs began arriving April 5.

According to HHS, the EIS shelters will provide required standards of care for children, such as clean sleeping quarters, meals, toiletries, laundry, and access to medical services. A COVID-19 health screening protocol for all children will reportedly be implemented to follow CDC guidelines. Services will be provided by a combination of contractors and federal staff – including teams from the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response and the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps.

The Dimmit County EIS near Carrizo Springs will provide shelter for 13–17-year-old males and females with a 400-bed capacity. The Pecos EIS houses 2,000 beds for the same age groups.

The number of unaccompanied minors in United States custody has steadily climbed over the last several months. There are nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children being held by HHS and CBP. The number has risen nearly 1 percent per day over the last two weeks, according to HHS.

According to a law enforcement source within CBP, nearly 19,000 unaccompanied children were apprehended in March, an all-time monthly record. HHS is scrambling to keep up by opening facilities and increasing capacity at an unprecedented pace.

In March alone, HHS opened nine facilities. Although current protocols dictate the children may only be in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody for 72 hours, many last 10 days, according to law enforcement sources. A number of Border Patrol facilities are facing issues with overcrowding.

HHS reports they accepted transfers of 754 unaccompanied children from CBP on April 4. The Border Patrol apprehended 414 children the same day. According to HHS, 242 unaccompanied children were discharged from custody to sponsors within the United States.

The potential detention capacity for unaccompanied children added by the Biden Administration since March 1 is more than 17,000 beds.

235,EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Smugglers Direct Two Unaccompanied Migrant Children to West Texas,"EAGLE PASS, Texas — Smugglers are bringing a steady flow of migrants. The two children in the video were brought across the Rio Grande by foot guides in Piedras Negras, less than a mile from the Eagle Pass Port of Entry on March 30. As the girls were being interviewed, smugglers could be heard whistling and telling them to leave the area.

A few days before Breitbart Texas conducted the interview, a 9-year-old Guatemalan child drowned in the same area despite efforts by Border Patrol to provide lifesaving care. The Rio Grande changes depth dramatically in various locations but the current is swift most of the year. Although Breitbart Texas journalists witnessed the smugglers bringing the children across the river before the interview, the older girl adamantly denies they were smuggled.

The sheer number of migrant crossings is a cash cow for cartels who control access to the Rio Grande. They collect fees from relatives in the United States using wire services and hold the migrants as collateral. Most migrants will not speak of the smuggling arrangements for fear of the cartels.

The Del Rio Sector, which covers Eagle Pass, apprehended more than 800 illegal immigrants the same day the girls were filmed. The daily average for March 2020 arrests within the Del Rio Sector was 85, an 800 percent increase this year.

On the same day these two children entered illegally, Health and Human Services (HHS) reported more than 18,000 unaccompanied migrant children were already in federal custody. They were just two of the 579 unaccompanied migrant children arrested by the Border Patrol that day.

The humanitarian needs of thousands of unaccompanied children crossing the border has impacted the Border Patrol’s ability to conduct routine duties. Migrant family units and unaccompanied children usually cross the border illegally and wait for agents to take them into custody. Single adults, who do not qualify for immediate release into the United States, cross in a more surreptitious fashion to avoid detection.

236,EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: 7-Year-Old Migrant Traveled Across Mexico with Only a Phone Number on Her Arm,"A 7-year-old girl from Honduras who made the journey to Texas had a phone number written on her arm as the only way to find her mother in South Carolina.

The girl crossed into Texas west of McAllen last week with a group of teens from Central America who became lost and were wandering dirt roads to find Border Patrol.

U.S. Congressman Chip Roy was traveling the border region unannounced to learn the true scope of the current crisis. During his most recent trip, Roy encountered several groups of lost migrants.

While speaking with the teens, Roy asked about a 7-year-old girl in the group who was clinging to another. The teens told him that she was not their sister and she joined them in Monterrey. Breitbart Texas is withholding the name of the girl and other identifying information.

The young girl told Roy that she was looking for her mother.

“And where does your mother live?” the congressman asked. The girl said South Carolina–and then after a brief exchange mentioned phone numbers written on her arm.

“Here I have my mom’s and here I also have an aunt’s.”

237,Human Smugglers Abandon Two Small Children in Texas near Border,"Del Rio Sector Border Patrol agents found two small children walking alone near the Rio Grande border. Officials say human smugglers abandoned the children in a remote area south of Del Rio, Texas.

Del Rio Sector Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero tweeted photos of two small children agents discovered walking by themselves after being abandoned by their human smugglers.

These two children were abandoned along the border and were found walking alone along the Rio Grande a mile south of Del Rio. They only had papers with contact information for relatives in the US and a few articles of spare clothing. A dangerous trend that continues. pic.twitter.com/wLcpgoJ643 — Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero (@USBPChiefDRT) April 5, 2021

Surveillance cameras picked up a video showing the two children walking by themselves on a dirt road near the Rio Grande and about a mile south of Del Rio. Border Patrol agents responded and found the two children with no supplies.

The children carried papers with contact numbers for alleged relatives in the United States and a few articles of spare clothing. They carried no food or water.

A few days prior, El Paso Sector Border Patrol agents captured video of human smugglers dropping two small girls (ages three and five) from a 14-foot border wall into an isolated area of a New Mexico landfill, Breitbart Texas first reported.

Shortly before that, a Texas Ranger, working with Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol agents rescued a six-month-old baby who human smugglers tossed into the Rio Grande.

Breitbart’s Randy Clark reported the rescue of five unaccompanied minors abandoned on the banks of the Rio Grande five miles from the nearest town. Del Rio Sector agents found the children in a remote area between Del Rio and Eagle Pass, Texas.

They were otherwise completely unprepared for the dangers ahead. pic.twitter.com/c24ayg2zgL — Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero (@USBPChiefDRT) March 29, 2021

Not far from this rescue, Del Rio Sector agents attempted to save the life of a nine-year-old girl who drowned while attempting to cross the Rio Grande with her mother and three-year-old sibling.

238,Feds Charge Alleged Human Smuggler with Deaths of 13 Migrants in California Vehicle Crash,"Federal prosecutors in California filed charges against an alleged human smuggler they say is responsible for the deaths of 13 migrants. The 13 Mexican and Guatemalan migrants died in a crash after the driver crossed the SUV illegally into the United States through a breached border wall barrier.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California filed charges related to Conspiracy to Bring Aliens to the United States Outside a Port of Entry Causing Serious Bodily Injury/Placing a Life in Jeopardy against 47-year-old Jose Cruz Noguez, a Mexican national. He is also charged with Bringing in Aliens Without Presentation for Financial Gain.

Officials say Cruz is a Mexican national with Legal Permanent Resident status. Law enforcement officials arrested him as he attempted to cross from the United States into Mexico on March 29. The court ordered Cruz be held over for a detention hearing on April 5.

Prosecutors say a suspected smuggler identified Cruz as an organizer of the smuggling attempt that resulted in the deaths of 13 migrants on March 2. The migrants died when the driver allegedly ran a stop sign while driving an SUV loaded with 25 people near Holtville, California, Breitbart Texas reported. The SUV pulled in front of a tractor-trailer that could not stop and broadsided the overloaded SUV.

In a secretly recorded conversation between Cruz and an associate, Cruz allegedly confirmed his role in the March 2 crash. He reportedly confirmed his associates cut the border wall fencing and that the two vehicles that passed through the border breach were “fully loaded.” He reportedly said he collected money for the smuggling attempt and that the driver would be paid $28,000 for bringing in the 60 “Pollos” (Spanish for chickens) into the United States.

Twelve people, including the driver, died at the scene of the crash. A 13th migrant died on the way to the hospital, prosecutors stated.

Cruz’s alleged co-conspirator said he began working for the reported human smuggler six months earlier after he illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico. He described Cruz as a “coordinator” and that Cruz paid him to drive migrants who had illegally crossed the border from El Centro, California to Los Angeles, the DOJ statement revealed. He said he also worked as a scout for Cruz as people were being crossed illegally into the U.S. near El Centro.

Cruz reportedly operated stash houses and collected smuggling payments from family members. He also is said to have recruited drivers and other scouts to detect the presence of law enforcement during smuggling operations.

Federal officials reported:

At approximately 5:56 a.m., Border Patrol Agents from the El Centro Border Patrol Station received a report from the California Highway Patrol of more than a dozen individuals running away from a burning GMC Yukon SUV and into the desert in Holtville, California. Border Patrol Agents were asked to respond to this suspected human smuggling event. At approximately 6:10 a.m., Border Patrol Agents responded to the area and extinguished the fire. Border Patrol Agents also followed foot tracks into the desert and apprehended 19 individuals hiding in the surrounding brush. Separately, at approximately 6:05 a.m., a Remote Video Surveillance System (RVSS) operator at the Calexico Border Patrol Station spotted multiple vehicles and approximately 20 individuals gathered in a remote area just south of the United States/Mexico border. He also noticed that the border fence in the area had been breached and an approximately 10-foot section of it had been removed and was laying on the ground in Mexico. Border Patrol Agents then reviewed video footage from the area and discovered that two vehicles had crossed through the fence at approximately 5:23 a.m.: the GMC Yukon SUV and a Ford Expedition. At 7:05 a.m., Border Patrol Agents at the Calexico Border Patrol Station received a request from the Calexico Police Department to assist with a mass-casualty vehicle crash in Holtville, California. Border Patrol Agents responding to the crash identified one of the vehicles involved as the Ford Expedition that recently had breached the border fence. A total of 25 individuals had been in the Ford Expedition at the time of the crash. Subsequent inspection of the Ford Expedition revealed that all but the driver and front passenger seats had been removed, presumably to fit that large number of people. Despite the best efforts of law enforcement and medical personnel, 12 individuals – including the suspected driver – died at the scene of the crash. Another individual died on the way to the hospital. The surviving 12 individuals were transported to various hospitals far and wide, including in San Diego. Many of the survivors were diagnosed with serious injuries.

Statements from federal law enforcement officials:

“These smuggling networks seek maximum profit by moving as many people as possible across the border with zero regard for their safety and well-being,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Randy Grossman. “Cramming dozens of people into eight-passenger vehicles and driving recklessly to avoid detection shows an utter disregard for human life. We will find and prosecute smugglers who use these methods and cause such tragic and avoidable deaths.” Grossman commended Assistant U. S. Attorneys Timothy Coughlin, Victor White, Shauna Prewitt, Patrick Swan and Blair Perez and agents from Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Border Patrol, El Centro Sector Intelligence Unit, for their excellent work on this case. “Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) remains steadfast in our commitment to pursue members of human smuggling networks such as the network that caused the tragic deaths in the March 2 smuggling incident,” said Cardell T. Morant, special agent in charge for HSI San Diego. “Our investigative efforts have led to the arrest of an individual who allegedly put those lives in danger, and this brings us another step closer to providing closure for the families. We will continue to work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to bring the perpetrators of this heinous crime to justice.” HSI’s tip line in the Calexico area is (760) 335-5343. “Thirteen individuals lost their lives on March 2nd due to unscrupulous human smugglers,” said El Centro Sector Border Patrol Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Border Patrol will stop at nothing to find, arrest, and prosecute smuggling organizations and this case is evidence of that.”

If convicted, Cruz faces up to 20 years in federal prison for the Conspiracy to Bring Aliens to the United States Outside a Port of Entry Causing Serious Bodily Injury/Placing a Life in Jeopardy charge. He also faces between three and ten years in prison if convicted for Bringing in Aliens Without Presentation for Financial Gain.

Cruz is scheduled for a preliminary hearing on April 13 and arraignment on April 27.

A copy of the criminal complaint remains restricted in online federal court records, Breitbart Texas learned.

The second shooting incident reportedly occurred in Grimes County, Texas, due east of the original shooting at an office park in Bryan, according to KBTX. Initial reports indicate that the shooter is the same suspect involved in the prior incident at Kent Moore Cabinets, according to KIRO. The unnamed suspect is reported to be an employee of the company, according to Bryan Police Chief Eric Buske.

At the original scene, one person died and four were rushed to a local hospital and are now listed in critical condition. Another victim is listed in non-critical condition due to an asthma attack, according to local reports.

Nearby Iola Independent School District has now lifted its lockdown in response to the shooting.

243,Texas Governor Bans Vaccine Passports with Executive Order,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued an executive order Tuesday morning banning the creation or use of a “vaccine passport.” It prohibits state agencies or political subdivisions in Texas from creating a “vaccine passport” or conditioning services on a person’s COVID-19 vaccination status.

“Everyday, Texans are returning to normal life as more people get the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. But, as I’ve said all along, these vaccines are always voluntary and never forced,” Governor Abbott said in a video announcing the order. “Government should not require any Texan to show proof of vaccination and reveal private health information just to go about their daily lives.”

“That is why I have issued an Executive Order that prohibits government-mandated vaccine passports in Texas,” the Texas governor continued. “We will continue to vaccinate more Texans and protect public health — and we will do so without treading on Texans’ personal freedoms.”

Abbott stressed the importance of vaccines in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and the reduction of serious illness resulting in hospitalizations and fatalities.

The Lone Star State is on pace to have administered more than 13 million vaccine doses by the end of this week, the governor explained.

“We will continue to vaccinate more Texans and protect public health,” Abbott concluded, “and we will do so without treading on Texans’ personal freedoms.”

In addition to impacting state agencies and local governments, the executive order also applies to any public or private entity that is receiving or will receive public funds through any means from requiring the presentation of vaccination status from consumers before rendering services.

Nursing homes, state-supported living centers, assisted living facilities, and long-term care facilities are allowed to continue requiring documentation of vaccination status.

244,Two Yemenis on FBI Terrorism Watch List Apprehended at Border in California,"El Centro Sector Border Patrol agents arrested two Yemeni nationals who illegally crossed the border into the U.S. in separate incidents during the past two months. Agents identified both men as being on the FBI’s Terrorism Watch List and the No-Fly list.

Agents assigned to the El Centro Border Patrol Station on March 30 arrested a migrant for illegally entering the United States approximately two miles west of the Calexico Port of Entry. The agents transported the man to the El Centro Processing Center where all migrants undergo a biometric background investigation and criminal background check, according to information obtained from CBP officials.

Agents identified the man as a 26-year-old illegal alien from Yemen. A records check found the man is listed on the FBI’s Terrorism Watch List and on the No-Fly list.

Officials said the man is being held in federal custody pending removal proceedings.

On January 29, El Centro Station agents arrested another migrant in nearly the same location west of the Calexico Port of Entry. The agents transported him to the station for processing and a background investigation.

The agents identified the man at a 33-year-old illegal alien from Yemen. Records revealed the Yemeni man is on the FBI’s Terrorism Watch List and the No-Fly list.

During a physical search, the agents also found a cell phone sim card hidden underneath the insole of his shoe, officials stated.

The agents processed the man and turned him over to ICE Homeland Security Investigations.

“Part of the Border Patrol’s mission states we will protect the country from terrorists,” Chief Patrol Agent Gregory K. Bovino said in a written statement. “Today, like every other day, our agents did that. These apprehensions at our border illustrate the importance of our mission and how we can never stop being vigilant in our everyday mission to protect this great country.”",1
245,Human Smugglers Use Facebook to Advertise ‘100 Percent Safe’ U.S. Border Crossings,"Facebook appears to allow human smugglers to advertise their services with false promises of “100 percent safety” and easy travel.

NBC News reported multiple Facebook posts reportedly found on the social media platform offering “Travel to Mexico to the United States. Costs $8,000. 100 percent safe.” The article states human smugglers are openly advertising their services and are making false claims about the journey.

“Cross through Matamoros. You walk one hour, after in automobile until you arrive to your relative,” one of the posts cited by NBC News states. NBC does not offer links to or screenshots of the alleged advertisements.

Breitbart Texas also found posts on Facebook offering “guide” services claiming to be safe.

Account Cruzo gente para los estados unidos posts multiple offers on Facebook promising safe passage from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, to McAllen, Texas, and beyond.

Another post offers safe, no scams travel at a “fair price.”

Gabriel Angel offices a “100 percent safe” passage with no walking, no river, and no wall jumping.

The posts cited by NBC News go into more specifics about the money connected to the passage to the United States.

“It’s ready. 3,000 to arrive at the line/ 6000 to jump to your destination. Whatever state. Pay when your relatives receive you,” an apparent smuggler post quoted by NBC News.

Facebook told NBC News it does not allow posts that promote human exploitation and trafficking. They say they remove all such posts when they are flagged by users. NBC said Facebook removed all of the posts they flagged.

This is not the first time human smugglers utilized Facebook to promote their criminal activities. In August 2020, Breitbart’s Chris Tomlinson reported smugglers in the Middle East were using Facebook to promote fake “cruises” to smuggle people to Europe. Similar Facebook posts occurred in August 2017.

In 2018, then-CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said the human smugglers in Central America act like travel agencies, Breitbart’s Penny Starr reported.

McAleenan said the smuggling services are “actually being advertised by smugglers who start this at the retail level — almost like a travel agency in communities in Central America, saying ‘If you bring a child with you, you will be released if you cross the border illegally and you’ll be allowed to stay in the United States.’”

The smugglers do not appear to warn the migrants of the very real dangers of being packed into tractor-trailers, locked in human smuggling stash houses, drownings in the various border rivers and waterways, death by dehydration, hypothermia, or heat stroke, or of the rapes, beatings and extortion incidents that are regular occurrences for migrants traveling the journey to and into the United States.",1
246,PHOTOS: Feds Debut New Migrant Detention Center in West Texas,"The Border Patrol showcased a new temporary processing and detention center in Eagle Pass, Texas, late last week.

The processing center was constructed to address the recent surge of migrants in the area. It is a soft-sided structure consisting of 96,000 square feet of detention, processing, dining, and recreation space.

The Border Patrol invited members of the media and general public to tour the new facility which was not yet occupied by migrants. According to a Border Patrol source, the facility will cost taxpayers roughly $6 million per month to operate.

The facility provides intake, medical screening, processing, detention, and food service areas. The facility is also equipped with a recreational area to serve large numbers of unaccompanied children.

The facility will be staffed by contract employees for medical and food service. Department of Homeland Security volunteers and Customs and Border Protection Office of Field Operations employees will assist in providing care for the detainees at the facilities while Border Patrol performs migrant intake processing.

The opening comes as many Border Patrol stations face capacity issues. There are roughly 5,000 unaccompanied children in custody nationally.

Del Rio Border Patrol Chief Patrol Agent Austin Skero and Patrol Agent in Charge Hugo Sanchez of the Eagle Pass South Station spoke to visitors about the benefits of a new facility.

Chief Skero told the crowd, “This facility will allow us to accommodate the increased flow of traffic in our area in a safer, more efficient manner and assist us to provide that same environment for our workforce.”

The facility is one of many the Biden Administration has constructed, re-opened, or leased for the purpose of addressing the surge of migrants who crossed the border in record numbers since January.

Health and Human Services (HHS) opened nine facilities during the month of March to accommodate the surge of unaccompanied children. Some of the facilities are hastily repurposed oil field man-camps and convention centers. The move to increase detention capacity has drawn criticism for issues related to COVID-19 and sanitation.

247,EXCLUSIVE: Criminal Alien Arrests near U.S. Border Exceed 4500 in 2021,"As the Border Patrol struggles to deal with the surge of migrants this fiscal year, one law enforcement source, speaking on a condition of anonymity, informs Breitbart Texas that more than 4,500 criminal aliens with serious records have been apprehended since October 1, 2020–the beginning of Fiscal Year 2021.

The term criminal alien is not used by the Border Patrol to refer to migrants with standalone immigration violations. It is reserved for those with convictions for state and federal crimes like murder, rape, sexual assault, burglary, robbery, narcotics, and others.

On March 19, 2021, Border Patrol agents arrested eight subjects near Mission, Texas. Agents discovered one Honduran in the group had a prior arrest by the Suffolk County Police Department in New York in 2007.

The Honduran was charged with rape and forcible compulsion and course of sexual conduct against a child. He was sentenced to nine years in prison.

Two days earlier, Border Patrol agents working near Falfurrias, Texas, arrested a Mexican national with a prior arrest in 2015 for rape by the Sandy Springs Police Department in Georgia. In that case, the man was convicted and sentenced to 20 years confinement, of which he served five.

CBP reports demonstrate that Fiscal Year 2021 is on pace to double the number of sex offenders apprehended, compared to the year prior in southern California. The San Diego Sector began tracking the annual apprehension of sex offenders in 2019.

Although only a small percentage of the migrants illegally entering the country have extensive criminal backgrounds, the source is concerned that many are eluding apprehension. As Border Patrol struggles to process and provide humanitarian care for the latest surge, fewer agents are on normal duty.

The number of migrants avoiding apprehension by Border Patrol exceeded 130,000 during the last six months.

The migrants appear to hide in a gully until a truck pulling a horse trailer arrives. The migrants load into the trailer and the driver speeds away.

One person remains behind and appears to return to the border wall.

The drone appears to follow the truck and trailer as they speed away.

Modlin tweeted that agents eventually stopped the vehicle. They arrested three U.S. citizens on charges relating to human smuggling. Inside the trailer, agents found 20 illegal immigrants, Modlin stated.

A search of the vehicle led to the discovery of a loaded firearm and five grams of methamphetamine, the chief said.

This section of Arizona is served by agents assigned to the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station. The station is named in memory of murdered Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.

249,Mexican Border State Cops Raid Hotel with Migrants — Release Them,"Mexican authorities raided a hotel in the border city of Reynosa and discovered a group of 13 Central American migrants. After the raid, Mexican immigration officials released the migrants who were able to prove they had legal permission to be in Mexico.

The raid took place on Friday evening after Tamaulipas State Police responded to an anonymous call about kidnapping victims at a hotel in the Puerta Del Sol neighborhood, the local newspaper El Manana reported. The migrants claimed that they had not been kidnapped and were simply staying at the hotel. Authorities identified the migrants as seven adults and three underage teens and children from Honduras and Nicaragua.

The state police officers turned the migrants over to agents from Mexico’s National Migration Institute who interviewed them and confirmed that they all had legal documents that allowed them to be in Mexico. They then released the group.

The raid and subsequent release come at a time when Mexican authorities experienced a dramatic spike in the number of migrants being moved by human smugglers to the border states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon trying to reach the Texas border. As Breitbart Texas reported, that practice has led to a rise in the number of stash houses being raided by state authorities.

250,86 Migrants Arrested in Five Failed Human Smuggling Attempts in Texas near Border,"Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector disrupted five human smuggling attempts. The interdictions led to the arrest of 86 migrants attempting to make their way into the U.S. interior.

Rio Grande City Station agents observed a group of migrants making landfall along the Rio Grande border river on April 2. The agents, along with a K-9 team and Texas Department of Public Safety troopers tracked the group to a residence in Rio Grande City, Texas, according to information obtained from Rio Grande Valley Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents observed fresh mud on the walls of the house near a window ledge. They called for support from Rio Grande City police officers to obtain entry into the house. Inside, agents found eight illegal aliens, officials stated.

Two days earlier, McAllen Statio agents received a call from the Mission Police Department about a possible human smuggling stash house in their city. Agents responded to the mobile home where they found a group of 13 migrants. Officials identified the migrants as foreign nationals from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua.

Later that night, agents attempted to stop a Ford F-350 pickup truck near Linn/San Manuel, Texas. The driver refused to yield leading the agents on a short pursuit. The pursuit ended when the truck crashed into a fence.

The agents observed a group of migrants bailing out of the truck and fleeing into the brush. A search of the area led to the apprehension of two Honduran nationals illegally present in the United States.

In two additional incidents on Thursday, Rio Grande Valley Sector agents apprehended 63 more migrants.

251,"Hollywood Celebrities Double Down On Pushing Democrat-Backed H.R.1, Which Would Gut Voter ID Requirements","Hollywood celebrities are doubling down on pushing the Democrat-backed H.R. 1 — the so-called “For the People Act” — which would gut voter identification requirements, protect illegal immigrants, and seize power from states to oversee their own elections.

As part of the hard sell, stars are spinning the legislation as a necessary antidote to — you guessed it — “voter suppression,” arguing the federal bill will counterbalance the “anti-voter” laws being passed by states like Georgia. Actors promoting H.R. 1 include Paul Bettany, Jane Lynch, Josh Gad, and Chelsea Handler.

Republican leaders in Congress have condemned H.R.1, saying it will create chaos and badly damage the electoral system if it passes the Senate. They have pointed to the bill’s provision that would essentially prevent states from enforcing their own voter identification laws, opening the door for voter fraud on a massive scale.

The law would also protect illegal aliens from prosecution if they are registered to vote automatically and never made an affirmative declaration that they were U.S. citizens.

As Breitbart News reported, a slew of Hollywood stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks has already voiced their support for the bill via an initiative from former first lady Michelle Obama. Other stars promoting the bill include Amy Schumer, George Takei, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Eva Longoria.

The Hollywood offensive continues with aggressive social media campaigning by a new slew of stars. Paul Bettany — who has appeared in The Da Vinci Code, Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, and A Beautiful Mind — urged his fans to help “build momentum” for the bill.

Like many stars, Bettany promoted an effort from the left-wing Declaration for American Democracy Coalition, which is sponsoring a “Week of Action” around the bill that ends Friday.

The West Wing star Bradley Whitford called H.R. 1 “the most consequential piece of legislation in decades.” Comedian-actress Jane Lynch seconded his call, urging her fans to “join the fight for voting rights.”

252,Directors Guild Leaders Deem Georgia Election Integrity Act a ‘Voter Suppression Law’,"Leaders of the Directors Guild of America (DGA) sent a letter to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (R), urging him to withdraw his support for the state’s new election integrity legislation, which they refer to as a “voter suppression law.”

“We write to condemn the voter suppression law Senate Bill 202, which threatens to undermine the pillar of our democracy — the right to vote,” reads the letter, obtained by Deadline, written by DGA president Thomas Schlamme and national executive director Russell Hollander. “President Biden has referred to the law both as an ‘atrocity’ and as a modern-day version of Jim Crow.”

Last month, Governor Kemp signed a bill aimed at improving state election integrity. The bill seeks to strengthen voting rules in the Peach State by limiting the number of ballot drop boxes and establishing photo ID requirements for absentee voters, among other things. Kemp blasted Biden and essentially said voters in Georgia have more voting access than do voters in Biden’s home state of Delaware.

“If you look at these comparisons, the state of Delaware has no in-person early voting. We have 17 days. In Georgia, you don’t have to have an excuse to get an absentee ballot by mail. In Delaware, you do. We have drop boxes. Delaware does not,” Kemp said last week. And if you want to get a bottle of water while you are standing in line in Georgia, you can absolutely do that. The elections officials can help you with that, but you can’t do that in Delaware because they don’t have early voting.”

The move has sparked outrage among left-wing activists, who consider the legislation an attack on minorities, suggesting that members of the black community cannot figure out how to acquire a photo ID, among other bizarre assumptions.

The DGA’s letter to Governor Kemp claims SB 202 will also “suppress the voice of black people and other people of color,” as well as “racially profile intimidate voters of color” by “allowing for unlimited challenges to a voter’s registration.”

“In the racially diverse Atlanta metro area where many of our members of color live, the number of registered voters far exceeds the availability of polling places,” the DGA elaborates. “Voting lines have been particularly long in nine Atlanta area counties with large black populations.”

The DGA also claims the law will “disenfranchise” its own members within the entertainment industry, mentioning “arduous work schedules,” “long hours,” and “weekend work” allegedly making it more difficult for DGA members to vote in person.

“Our jobs involve long hours (often 12 hours or more a day) and frequent weekend work. They take us to sound stages and shooting locations across county lines as well as international borders, on assignments that may last up to a year or more,” the DGA explains. “Because of our arduous work schedules, our members have a particular need to avail themselves of early and absentee voting.”

“And they will be particularly at risk of the new law’s limitations on ballot drop boxes, early voting in run-offs, and absentee voting,” the letter adds.

Hollywood elites have become particularly invested in Georgia politics in recent years, due to tax incentives that have brought the entertainment industry to the Peach State and relocated swarms of its left-wing members to Georgia.

“As a leading voice representing creative workers in the industry, we are compelled to denounce SB 202, which will disenfranchise our members, and disproportionately impact our members of color, and millions of other hardworking Georgians,” the DGA affirms.

The letter adds that it was written “on behalf of the more than 18,000 members” of the DGA, “including more than 400 who make their home in Georgia, and hundreds more who choose Georgia as the location for their film and television projects.”

“We urge you to reconsider your support for this misguided law and to make every effort to unwind its restrictions before it takes full effect on July 1st,” the DGA concludes in its letter.

253,"‘Supergirl’ Cast Explodes over Arkansas Banning Transgender Drugs, Surgery for Minors: ‘This Will Hurt Kids’","The cast of the CW network series Supergirl are outraged over the Arkansas legislature overriding Gov. Asa Hutchinson’s (R) veto of a measure banning transgender drugs and surgery for minors, describing it as “sickening” and concluding the move will “hurt kids.”

“This will hurt kids. You all should be ashamed,” Nicole Maines, who plays the transgender superhero Nia Nal/Dreamer, told her 70k Twitter followers.

This will hurt kids. You should all be ashamed. https://t.co/awnkw0tpoa — Nicole Maines (@NicoleAMaines) April 7, 2021

Chyler Leigh, Maines’ Supergirl castmate, said the debate is one of “LIFE & DEATH” for transgender youth.

This a matter of LIFE & DEATH for transgender youth!!!#TransRightsAreHumanRights https://t.co/JTcv2KvVk8 — Chyler Leigh (@chy_leigh) April 7, 2021

Supergirl writer Eric Carrasco called the legislature’s move “sickening,” while Jon Cryer, who plays Lex Luther, described the it as “truly disgusting.”

“Elected Republicans think that they can win politically by denying the basic humanity of trans people,” Cryer said.

Elected Republicans think that they can win politically by denying the basic humanity of trans people. Truly disgusting. #TransRightsAreHumanRights https://t.co/UmvkwCcUDV — Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) April 7, 2021

Their remarks follow the Arkansas legislature’s decision to override the governor’s veto of a bill, the Arkansas Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act (HB 1570), that prevents minors from having gender transition surgeries or receiving transgender drugs. Defending his veto, Hutchinson called the measure “well-intended, but off course.”

“If House Bill 1570 becomes law, then we are creating new standards of legislative interference with physicians and parents as they deal with some of the most complex and sensitive matters involving young people,” he said, contending the measure would “put the state as the definitive oracle of medical care, overriding parents, patients and healthcare experts.”

“While in some instances, the state must act to protect life, the state should not presume to jump into the middle of every medical, human, and ethical issue,” he said, describing it as a “vast government overreach.”

Arkansas Rep. Robin Lundstrum (R) defended the legislation, explaining the bill “simply protects minors from being preyed upon and pressured into making adult decisions before they are ready.”

“Those who claim otherwise are not being honest, and either haven’t read the bill or are placing fundraising above the best interest of children,” the Republican added.

The state’s action follows the greater move nationally to diminish the legal meaning of sex as Democrats in Congress continue to push forward the Equality Act, which effectively favors gender identity over traditional, legal recognition of biological sex and strips protections from biological women, allowing individuals to use sex-specific areas based on gender identity.

Health professionals continue to warn about the severe mental and physical harm caused as a result of puberty-blocking drugs be administered to and sex surgeries being performed on minors.",1
254,"Rose McGowan Rips Producer Scott Rudin: Hollywood, ‘Your Value System Is Sick’","Actress Rose McGowan has added her voice to the growing tide of accusations against Scott Rudin, saying the powerful Hollywood producer “must be stopped.” She also called out Tom Cruise and South Park‘s Trey Parker, implying they know about Rudin’s behavior.

In a tweet early Thursday, Rose McGowan called the entertainment industry “sick” and said Hollywood is “poisoning” the culture. She noted Scott Rudin is credited as a producer on The Firm, the 1993 Tom Cruise movie, and on Team America: World Police, the 2004 animated comedy directed by Trey Parker.

“They all know,” she wrote.

Tom Cruise to Trey Parker. They all know. Super producer Scott Rudin must be stopped. Enough. What is wrong with you Hollywood? You are putting your values in our minds. Your value system is sick. Stop poisoning us. End power abuse now. pic.twitter.com/OYFhZGC8qp — Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) April 8, 2021

On Wednesday, the Hollywood Reporter published a scathing article about Rudin detailing anew his pattern of workplace abuse and bullying.

The accusations include a previously unreported incident in which Rudin allegedly smashed a computer monitor on an assistant’s hand, causing the assistant to go to the emergency room, and another in which he allegedly threw a stapler at an assistant and called him a “retard.”

For years, Rudin has faced accusations of abusive managerial behavior but Hollywood looked the other way as his movies and Broadway productions raked in money and awards. Now the tide is turning against Rudin as the entertainment industry continues its reckoning with workplace abuse.

Annapurna producer Megan Ellison added her voice to the denunciations on Wednesdy, accusing Rudin of “abusive, racist, and sexist behavior.”

255,Report: Oscar-Winning Hollywood Producer Scott Rudin Engaged in Years of Abusive Workplace Behavior,"As Hollywood continues its reckoning with bad managerial behavior, former assistants to Oscar-winning movie producer Scott Rudin are once again coming forward to spill the beans on his pattern of abusive workplace practices, including an incident in which he allegedly smashed a computer monitor on an assistant’s hand and another in which he allegedly threw a stapler at an assistant and called him a “retard.”

In a lurid new report, The Hollywood Reporter details several previously unreported instances of workplace abuse and bullying allegedly committed by Rudin, the celebrated and feared producer behind such critically acclaimed movies as No Country for Old Men, The Social Network, Lady Bird, and The Grand Budapest Hotel.

For years, Rudin, 62, has faced accusations of mistreating his assistants, with media reports dating back more than a decade detailing his volcanic temper that could boil over, allegedly, to physical violence. But Hollywood continues to look the other way as Rudin’s movies and Broadway productions — including The Book of Mormon musical — generate big profits and awards galore.

The new report comes as the entertainment industry attempts to deal with its pervasive culture of workplace bullying in which assistants have borne the brunt of bad managerial behavior. The Ellen DeGeneres Show was the most recent target, with employees claiming a toxic work environment and abusive practices by senior management.

The Reporter‘s story includes an incident in 2012 when Rudin became so enraged that one of his assistants failed to book him a seat on a sold-out flight that he allegedly smashed an Apple computer monitor on the assistant’s hand. The screen reportedly shattered, leaving the young man bleeding. The assistant went to the emergency room while Rudin dialed his lawyer.

The victim ultimately received three associate producing credits and a monetary settlement, anonymous sources told the Reporter. Most bullying claims against Rudin are settled quietly, a legal source told the trade journal.

Rudin’s company is small by Hollywood standards, with an estimated two dozen or fewer full-time staffers. Rudin, who is gay, tends to hire young male assistants who are eager to get their start in the movie or theater industries.

The producer is infamous for frequently firing, and then re-hiring, his assistants based on perceived incompetencies.

In another incident from 2018, Rudin allegedly threw a baked potato at an assistant for not knowing why people from indie distributor A24 were waiting in the lobby. “He threw it at me, and I dodged a big potato. He was like, ‘Well, find out, and get me a new potato,'” the former assistant told the Reporter.

In the end, Rudin reportedly fired the assistant, who had dropped out of college to join Rudin’s company.

A man who was Rudin’s executive assistant from 2018 to 2019 claims to have experienced and witnessed so much mistreatment — including Rudin allegedly throwing a stapler at a theater assistant and calling him a “retard” — that he quit the industry altogether.

“Every day was exhausting and horrific,” Ryan Nelson told the Reporter.

Despite his reputation, Rudin continues to work regularly with some of the best Hollywood filmmakers, including Wes Anderson, Aaron Sorkin, and the Coen brothers.

Rudin is also a prolific Broadway producer, recently backing Sorkin’s adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird, which was a box-office hit. His other stage productions include The Book of Mormon as well as acclaimed revivals of Fences, A Raisin in the Sun, and The Iceman Cometh, all of which starred Denzel Washington.

256,"Hollywood Producer Megan Ellison Accuses Scott Rudin of ‘Abusive, Racist, and Sexist Behavior’","In a rare public accusation between powerful Hollywood producers, Megan Ellison has accused Scott Rudin of “abusive, racist, and sexist behavior,” saying the recent Hollywood Reporter article detailing anew his pattern of workplace bullying “barely scratches the surface.”

Megan Ellison, who heads Annapurna Pictures and is the daughter of Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, tweeted her accusation against Rudin on Wednesday. She compared the Oscar-winning Rudin to Harvey Weinstein, saying people are still afraid to speak out because of his ruthless behavior.

This piece barely scratches the surface of Scott Rudin’s abusive, racist, and sexist behavior. Similarly to Harvey, too many are afraid to speak out. I support and applaud those who did. There’s good reason to be afraid because he’s vindictive and has no qualms about lying. https://t.co/0iFSgzJx9T — Megan Ellison (@meganeellison) April 7, 2021

Ellison didn’t elaborate on her accusations against Rudin. Her Annapurna Pictures is a competitor to Rudin’s company, both specializing in prestige movies that tend to garner Academy Award attention.

Ellison also reportedly feuded with Harvey Weinstein over business matters, including the 2012 Paul Thomas Anderson movie The Master, which Ellison produced and Weinstein distributed. Though it garnered rave reviews and multiple Oscar nominations, the movie was a financial disappointment.

As Breitbart News reported, Rudin faces fresh accusations of workplace abuse and bullying from a Hollywood Reporter article containing several accounts of his alleged behavior. They include an incident in which he allegedly smashed a computer monitor on an assistant’s hand, causing the assistant to go to the emergency room, and another in which he allegedly threw a stapler at an assistant and called him a “retard.”

Hollywood is rife with tales of Rudin’s tyrannical behavior toward his staff. A 2005 Wall Street Journal article about Rudin titled “Boss-Zilla!” has become essential reading for anyone entering the movie business.

257,"Video: Jimmy Kimmel Gushes over Hunter Biden Beating Crack Addiction, Skips Foreign Investments Scandals","Hunter Biden took his reputation rehabilitation-book tour to ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday, where he spoke about his crack addiction but was spared serious questions about his laptop scandal or how he secured lucrative foreign deals while his father Joe Biden was vice president of the United States.

Left-wing host Jimmy Kimmel avoided asking Hunter Biden questions about the contents of his laptop or the murky foreign deals he allegedly made on behalf of the Biden family and his father. Instead, Kimmel lobbed mostly softball queries and gave the younger Biden a platform to talk about his triumph over crack addiction.

“Yeah, it was a journey, but thank God I made it through,” Biden said. “For me it was important to be completely honest about the entire experience.” He added crack “had brought me to a place I had never been to before… It was an absolutely awful experience at the end. And it was an awful experience throughout.”

Watch below:

Hunter Biden also praised his father, saying the president has a “genuine desire to take some of that toxicity” out of politics. Kimmel didn’t push back on the claim, failing to bring up instances when President Biden has insulted conservatives and Republicans.

We found Hunter! pic.twitter.com/S9qw3Up2BX — Jimmy Kimmel Live (@JimmyKimmelLive) April 9, 2021

Kimmel also asked Hunter Biden if it makes him “crazy” when he hears someone like Donald Trump Jr. saying that the only reason he’s had any success is because he’s “a Biden.”

Biden appeared uneasy with the question, awkwardly agreeing with Kimmel that “it is wildly comical. That is putting it lightly.”

Kimmel egged him on, asking if he had ever met Donald Trump Jr. Biden replied, “Not that I know of,” adding, “but I’ve been in some pretty rough places.”

The mainstream media refused to cover the Hunter Biden scandal in the months prior to the November election, though some outlets are belatedly acknowledging that the laptop contents are authentic.

Watch below:

Breitbart News senior contributor Peter Schweizer said Joe Biden is a “direct beneficiary” of Hunter Biden’s dealings, and detailed — in his bombshell investigatory blockbuster Profiles in Corruption: Abuse of Power by America’s Progressive Elite — and elsewhere how the lucrative deals Hunter executed “happened while Joe Biden was vice president of the United States. … and “once he became a central player in American foreign policy.”

258,China to Hollywood: Stop ‘Randomly Mixing Chinese Elements’ into Movies,"China’s state-run Global Times on Thursday told Hollywood it needs to do more than just throw a few “Chinese elements” into big-budget films if it wants to succeed at the Chinese box office, which surpassed the American box office during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.

The Global Times editorial offered few concrete suggestions for how American films could compete more effectively in China, whose film industry has begun producing “homegrown” big-budget features that frequently outperform even recent Hollywood successes like Godzilla vs. Kong.

“The top ten most anticipated films during China’s May Labor Day holiday are all domestic films, including Zhang Yimou’s first spy thriller Impasse, video game-based fantasy Dynasty Warriors, and adventure suspense film Schemes in Antiques,” the article reported.

On the other hand, Chinese audiences are supposedly somewhat tepid about most high-profile upcoming American releases, although they are apparently keeping their fingers crossed for Fast and Furious 9, suggesting exploding cars may have become a universal cinematic language that crosses all cultural barriers.

“Maybe it is because of the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] epidemic that Chinese people are turning their eyes more toward their own stories,” the Global Times warned. “If Hollywood still cannot really respect and understand Chinese culture and just randomly mixes some Chinese elements into their films, it will lose a large amount of its fans in China.”

Many Americans are worried the Chinese Communist Party already has too much influence over Hollywood, and the problem could grow worse if the crippled American theater industry does not swiftly recover from the pandemic, since — as the Global Times unsubtly hinted — Chinese box office receipts will become increasingly important to the profitability of American studios.

Sometimes American filmmakers throw in the sort of little gestures to Chinese culture or politics the Global Times derided, adding scenes to the Chinese release of movies — or, increasingly, planting them right in the middle of the cut American audiences see — that show extremely efficient and professional Chinese scientists or military officials popping in to help deal with the aliens, giant robots, or other movie menaces of a Hollywood production.

In other cases, Hollywood films are rewritten to make them more palatable to Chinese government censors, which is how the ageless Tibetan sorcerer who should have taught magic to Doctor Strange absurdly became Tilda Swinton, without a peep of concern from the hypersensitive film industry about the loss of a plum opportunity for an Asian actor.

In an especially weird recent example, the goofy video game-fantasy film Monster Hunter — which went out of its way to include roles for Asian actors — was yanked out of Chinese theaters and hastily edited because ten seconds of dialogue supposedly offended “patriotic Chinese audiences.”

Chinese audiences were so offended they proceeded to review-bomb the game the movie was based on, even though the supposedly offensive joke from the movie has absolutely nothing to do with the game, and further demanded “punishment” for everyone involved in producing the film.

Some of the Monster Hunter critics lambasted the film’s Chinese partners and distributors for thinking they could douse the flames of patriotic anger merely by clipping the objectionable dialogue out instead of banning the film altogether, which sounds a bit like the Global Times telling Hollywood it cannot compete in the increasingly important Chinese market by adding a few “Chinese elements” to its productions.

The expectation seems to be that American studios will cater more fervently to China and take even more steps to ensure their biggest movies actively please Chinese audiences, while studiously avoid giving the smallest hint of cultural or political offense. Given the current state of the U.S. box office, this might not be an unreasonable expectation.",1
259,Meghan McCain: Andrew Breitbart Was the Pioneer on Conservatives Embracing Culture War Fight,"Meghan McCain told her co-hosts Thursday on ABC’s “The View” that Andrew Breitbart was a pioneer in knowing conservatives and Republicans “have to fight the culture war.”

McCain said, “Andrew Breitbart is a figure on the right who passed away about ten ago.”

Citing no examples or evidence, she asserted, “He’s nothing like the way his website is now. The name Breitbart has been turned into this sort of extreme Trump organization.”

McCain continued, “He was really compelling on what his message was when he was alive, which was that conservatives and Republicans have to also fight the culture war on the ground up. We have quite frankly done a piss poor job of explaining why we’re conservative, why we believe in small government, why the ideals of William F. Buckley and Ronald Reagan are a better way to run the government, explaining our successes. Unfortunately, the more radical elements of the party get the most attention. The most psychotic and crazy, the Matt Gaetz of the party end up sucking up the oxygen.”

She added, “All of us have to do a better job. I say this as a conservative on mainstream media we have to start fighting these battles on in uncomfortable spaces. It can’t only be on Newsmax and Fox News. We have to go into spaces people don’t like us and explain and proselytize and get people to understand why we believe what we believe because right now all of you are right — we are losing the culture war, and it’s a big problem.”

Whoopi Goldberg said, “A new Gallup poll shows the largest increase in Democratic Party affiliation in nearly ten years. So people are seeming to be quite surprised by this. So Sunny, why do you think this swing to the left seems to be happening?”

Hostin said, “You know, I think, Whoopi, this is a direct result of what happened with the, you know, former disgraced, twice impeached one-term president. I’ve said it before that you have a Republican Party that I think is unrecognizable to those that are centrist Republicans, those that are just sort of these conservative Republicans that we knew before like the John McCain, Republicans, the Republicans I think that Meghan grew up with. I’ve been reading John Boehner’s book. And he says in his book, the crazies have taken over. And I think the Republican Party is sort of this extremist, anti-scientist, nativist, embracing white supremacists insurrectionist party at this point.”

She added, “Kevin McCarthy really needs to rethink that strategy that this is an open, big-tent party and all are welcome. Really are the Marjorie Taylor Greenes welcome? Are the Boeberts welcome? Are the Matt Gaetzs welcome in this party? That is what has lead to the alienation of mainstream Republicans. They don’t want to be extremists.”

261,"Diddy Demands Big Biz 'Reinvest an Equitable Percentage' in Black Communities: 'If You Love Us, Pay Us'","Rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs is demanding woke corporations step up and reinvest an “equitable percentage” into black communities, blasting “Corporate America” for manipulating the black community into “believing that incremental progress is acceptable action.”

In an April 8 op-ed, the “I’ll Be Missing You” artist sharply criticized big business– specifically companies such as General Motors (GM) — for what he described as exploiting black culture, undermining its power, and excluding black entrepreneurs.

We’re done letting corporations manipulate our culture into believing incremental progress is acceptable action. IF YOU LOVE US, PAY US. Here’s my letter to corporate America.https://t.co/zm0zNtaX7p — Diddy (@Diddy) April 8, 2021

GM, he said, listed his network, REVOLT, as “an example of the black-owned media it supports.” While he recognized that it does, in fact, receive advertising revenue from the corporation, Diddy said it is flawed to point to the relationship as an “example of success.”

“Instead, REVOLT, just like other black-owned media companies, fights for crumbs while GM makes billions of dollars every year from the black community,” he said. “Exposing GM’s historic refusal to fairly invest in black-owned media is not an assassination of character, it’s exposing the way GM and many other advertisers have always treated us.”

In 2019, brands spent $239 billion on advertising. Less than 1% of that was invested in Black-owned media companies. Out of the roughly $3 billion General Motors spent on advertising, we estimate only $10 million was invested in Black-owned media. Only $10 million out of $3 billion! Like the rest of Corporate America, General Motors is telling us to sit down, shut up and be happy with what we get.

Diddy said it is “disrespectful” that black-owned media companies represent one percent of the total advertising market and that distributors “refuse to carry black-owned media brands in an era where our impact and influence is undeniable.”

“It’s disrespectful that the same community that represents 14% of the population and spends over $1.4 trillion annually is still the most economically undervalued and underserved at every level,” he said, calling on Corporate America to “reinvest an equitable percentage of what you take from our community back into our community.”

As an example, he declared that if the black community represents 15 percent of a company’s revenue, black-owned media should receive that proportion of the company’s advertising expenditures.

“The same way you understand the power of our dollars, we understand our power to take them away from any corporation that doesn’t give us the economic inclusion we deserve,” he wrote, warning black Americans are “prepared to weaponize” their money.

Diddy left Corporate America with an ultimatum, warning there is no middle ground. His message comes as corporations continue to become increasingly more “woke,” prioritizing social justice issues championed by the left. In February, for example, Quaker Oats announced it would change the name of its famous Aunt Jemima syrup brand to Pearl Milling Company over concerns of “negative stereotypes.” Uncle Ben’s rice received a similar makeover, altering its “brand identity” to “end racial biases and injustices.”

More recently, corporate leaders have inserted themselves in the debate over legislation seeking to protect minors from receiving life-altering transgender surgery and drugs, as the battle continues to heat up across the U.S.",1
262,"CBS Station Executives Leave the Company Amid Probe Into Racist, Abusive Behavior","CBS Television Stations executives Peter Dunn and David Friend “will not return to their positions, and will be leaving the company” following allegations of racist and abusive behavior.

“Peter Dunn, President of the CBS Television Stations, and David Friend, Senior Vice President of News for the Stations group, will not return to their positions and will be leaving the Company,” CBS said in a statement, according to a report by The Wrap. The company added that “on an interim basis, Bryon Rubin will continue to run the Stations group while Kim Godwin will continue her oversight of Stations’ news operations until new leadership is in place.”

Both Dunn and Friend were accused of fostering a workplace environment in which female employees were intimidated, and black journalists were blocked from being hired. The pair were placed on leave after the Los Angeles Times first reported the accusations.

In January, CBS hired the law firm Proskauer Rose to investigate allegations of racism, sexism, and abusive workplace behavior. “The external investigation into CBS Television Stations management that is being conducted by Keisha-Ann Gray at Proskauer Rose remains ongoing,” CBS continued in its statement.

“We are thankful to those who have shared their experiences and knowledge with the investigators thus far,” the company said. “CBS is committed to a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace where all voices are heard, claims are investigated and appropriate action is taken when necessary.”

The executives’ exit come a little more than a year after CBS merged with Viacom, which followed a difficult time for CBS, as the company had just undergone its longtime CEO Les Moonves destroying scores of evidence and lying to investigators conducting a probe into multiple allegations against him, ranging from sexual harassment to rape.

“This entire process, while sometimes painful and emotional, is an important step forward in living up to our promise of a safe, inclusive, respectful and equitable workplace for all of us,” CBS boss George Cheeks wrote in an email to staff.

CBS Studios has recently entered an overall deal with Black Lives Matter, gender equity activist, and “Me Too” founder Tarana Burke, and her producing partner Mervyn Marcano. Burke and Marcano will be developing scripted, unscripted, and documentary content in partnership with CBS Studios.

Donovon W. Lynch was shot by a police officer on March 26 when officers arrived at a street party in response to a call about shots fired. Officers and witnesses said Lynch came on the scene with a gun in his hand, prompting an officer to fire at him.

That same night, eight people were shot, and one other was killed in shootings around the area where Lynch was shot after the confrontation with the police.

The police arrested three suspects, including Ahmon Jahree Adams, 22, Nyquez Tyyon Baker, 18, and Devon Maurice Dorsey Jr., 20. The other fatality that night was 29-year-old Bad Girls Club star Deshayla Harris. Harris is known for her appearance on Season 17 of Oxygen Network’s Bad Girls Club, which was dubbed “East Meets West.”

It does not appear that the Virginia Beach Police Department has any suspects in the Harris shooting.

264,Feds Charge Actor Zach Avery in Alleged $227 Million Hollywood Ponzi Scheme,"An actor, known as Zach Avery, who has had minor roles in a handful of films and shorts has been accused of running a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme involving phony movie distribution deals.

Zachary Joseph Horwitz, who has acted under the name is Zach Avery, was charged with fraud by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles after allegedly defrauding investors out of more than $227 million, according to the Hollywood Reporter.

Horwitz, who has fifteen acting credits to his name going back to 2009, could face 20 years in prison if convicted on all charges.

The 34-year-old actor reportedly told investors that their money would be invested to purchase film rights that he said would be sold to HBO, Netflix, and other services, studios, and producers. Horwitz launched 1inMM Capital LLC in 2013, claiming that the company would distribute British films to Latin American markets through distributing deals with HBO and Netflix.

However, instead of investing in film projects, prosecutors say that Horwitz used the cash from succeeding investors to pay off earlier investors and to fund personal expenses, including a $6 million home. Prosecutors also said that none of the streaming services and distributors have ever had any dealings with Horwitz.

“Horwitz provided investors with fake license agreements, as well as fake distribution agreements with Netflix and HBO, all of which contained forged or fictional signatures,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Horwitz allegedly sent investors bottles of Johnny Walker Blue Label scotch and claimed in 2015 that his company had “acquired and successfully distributed 49 films through the 1inMM Capital banner without incurring a single loss in the process.”

There is no evidence that any of the “49 films” exist. And as the promised return on investment time came and went, Horwitz supposedly began fabricating email exchanges he claimed were sent by HBO and Netflix executives to convince investors that the deals were pending.

“In reality, neither Horwitz [Avery] nor 1inMM Capital ever engaged in email correspondence with Netflix or HBO, nor did Horwitz [Avery] or 1inMM Capital ever have any business relationship with Netflix or HBO at all,” said FBI agent John Verrastro.

Horwitz’s acting credits include You Are Not Alone, The White Crow, and Farming. He also had an uncredited part in Brad Pit’s war film Fury.

265,Morgan Freeman Rips People Who Don’t Get Coronavirus Vaccine: ‘I Will Avoid You’,"Actor Morgan Freeman slammed people “refusing” to get the coronavirus vaccine, stating, “I will avoid you.” The actor’s comments arrive just days after the release of a PSA urging people to get the vaccine.

Morgan Freeman told Daily Show host Trevor Noah that he hopes “those people who are refusing to take these doggone shots would change their minds and realize that this is one of the things we really have to do.”

“I don’t understand, to tell you the truth, anyone who has some issues with the idea of being vaccinated against this scourge,” Freeman continued. “The facts are in. We know that all of those dead people are dead, and why they’re dead. They didn’t get hit by trucks or anything. It was this pandemic.”

Therefore, Freeman added that he would “recommend highly” for people to “go get the freaking shots.”

“But if you don’t, it’s really up to you. Except that now I have to avoid you. And I will,” Freeman affirmed.

Watch Below:

The actor also addressed reluctance to get the vaccine within the black community due to the Tuskegee experiments once conducted by the U.S. government, working with the Tuskegee Institute, using black men as guinea pigs in a study to record the natural history of syphilis.

“I heard yesterday of people saying that there are a lot of black people who just don’t trust it because of the Tuskegee experiment. That’s horse-puckey. I don’t believe that. That’s ridiculous,” Freeman said. “This is a whole new world, a whole new society, a whole new group of people, and this thing here is for real. It’s not something somebody made up as a test to see how we’ll react to it.”

And in response to anyone criticizing him for getting involved in the debate surrounding the coronavirus vaccine, Freeman said, “I’m trying to keep my peace, stay above the ground. You do what you gotta do, I’ll do what I gotta do.”

“And I suppose one of the things that I have to do is say to you, those, ‘Get the shot. Help protect me,'” Freeman added.

On Monday, Freeman released a PSA encouraging people to get the coronavirus vaccine, saying it will help make the world a safer place.

“I’m not a doctor, but I trust science. And I’m told that, for some reason, people trust me,” Freeman said. “So here I am to say, I trust science, and I got the vaccine. If you trust me, you’ll get the vaccine.”

266,"Joy Behar: Abortion Is a Privacy Issue, Not Coronavirus Vaccines","Joy Behar told her co-hosts Wednesday on ABC’s “The View” that abortion is a privacy issue, not businesses such as restaurants, amusement parks, concert venues, cruise ships, and airlines requiring proof of a coronavirus vaccine for entry.

Behar said, “If I have to get a vaccine on my passport, so be it. You know, I mean, if you’re so scared or so intent or you’re a Republican male with wants to screw around with the libs or something, then don’t come on the cruise with me. Leave the buffet to me. Get a rowboat. Don’t even go there with me.”

She added, “Also, this idea that it’s a privacy issue, why is this a privacy issue? The same people who say it is overreach are anti-choice. Roe v. Wade was settled on a privacy issue. It’s the law. This is an invasion of my privacy when you are sick in the same building as I am in. I’m against that. I am totally against you coming anywhere near me without a vaccine. I would like you to prove it. Don’t the kids have to get vaccines to get into school? Don’t you have to get a malaria vaccine to go to certain countries? Come on!”

267,Spotify Has Censored 42 Episodes of ‘The Joe Rogan Experience’ Podcast,"Music streaming service Spotify has reportedly continued to censors episodes of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast from its platform as part of its $100 million exclusive deal with the show. 42 episodes have now been censored by the platform, with reports indicating more episodes are likely to disappear. Some censored episodes appear to have been targeted based on jokes.

DigitalMusicNews reports that the music and podcast streaming service Spotify has continued to remove episodes of The Joe Rogan Experience podcast as part of its $100 million deal with the show. Spotify has more reportedly removed 42 episodes of the podcast, with more shows still at risk of being deleted.

Digital Music News reports:

Among the newly-missing is an episode (#411) with Bulletproof Coffee founder Dave Asprey, a frequent guest on The Joe Rogan Experience. Strangely, Spotify has deleted three total episodes with Asprey for reasons that aren’t entirely clear. One explanation for the removals is that Asprey frequently backs controversial anti-aging and scientific theories, including claims that Bulletproof Coffee is extremely healthy while other coffee brands are not. Asprey has designed the ‘Bulletproof Diet,’ and frequently criticizes coffee manufacturers for leaving high levels of damaging mycotoxins in their blends. Asprey — who has predicted that he will live to the age of 180 — is certainly unconventional in his theories, though it appears that Spotify has decided to debunk his claims by removing his episodes entirely.

Other removed episodes include episode #149, “Live from the Icehouse,” which featured host Joe Rogan, Little Esther, Al Madrigal, Josh McDermitt, Brendon Walsh, Felicia Michaels, and Brian Redban. What caused the deletion of the episode is unknown although many raunchy jokes were made during the recording.

Spotify also recently deleted episode #276 also featuring Little Esther, Al Madrigal, Josh McDermitt, Brendon Walsh, Felicia Michaels, and Brian Redban. A total of seven different episodes featuring guest David Seaman have been nixed, as have seven episodes featuring Brian Redban.

Four episodes featuring the comedian Chris D’Elia who was recently accused of sexual misconduct by a number of women. Other guests who have had episodes removed include Owen Benjamin, Joey Diaz, Gavin McInnes, and Eddie Bravo. Breitbart News previously reported on the removal of episodes featuring Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos.

Spotify has not provided a full explanation for the removal of the episodes or even addressed complaints from fans of the podcast. Joe Rogan himself confirmed that Spotify removed certain episodes as a condition of their $100 million agreement with him. “There were a few episodes they didn’t want on their platform, and I was like ‘okay, I don’t care’,” Rogan stated in an interview with Fahim Anwar.

268,Nolte: Woketard Screen Actors Guild Award Ratings Collapse 64% from 2019,"The 65-year-old Ten Commandments drew more than four times as many viewers as Sunday’s woketard Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Dear Hollywood: Guess what? Nobody wants to watch members of Hollywood’s Woketard Gestapo celebrate other members of Hollywood’s Woketard Gestapo with golden idols as you shame normal people for believing in things like election integrity, not chemically castrating five-year-olds, keeping grown men out of our daughter’s bathroom, owning guns, and personal liberty.

Isn’t that the only blatantly obvious reason for the ratings annihilation of all these woketard award shows, including Sunday night’s Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Award show?

How humiliating were Sunday night’s Woke Gestapo SAG Award ratings…?

Tee hee.

So humiliating, the Woke Gestapo SAG ratings hit an all-new low.

So humiliating, the Woke Gestapo SAG ratings were down about 50 percent over last year’s record low.

So humiliating, the Woke Gestapo SAG ratings collapsed a whopping 64 percent from 2019.

So humiliating, the Woke Gestapo SAG Awards aired on two major cable networks (TNT and TBS) and still only managed to draw 957,000 total viewers.

Yep, so humiliating fewer than a million people tuned in.

And now we get to my favorite part.

You’re going to love this part…

While fewer than a million people turned in to the Woke Gestapo SAG Awards on Sunday night — the night prior, on Saturday night, more than four times as many people tuned in to watch a 65-year-old Bible movie.

LOL.

While modern-day Hollywood couldn’t draw even a million viewers on two major cable networks, on Saturday night, Cecil B. DeMille’s 65-year-old Biblical epic, The Ten Commandments (1956), drew 4.07 million total viewers.

In other words, more than four times as many people would prefer to watch a 65-year-old movie that’s been available on home video for four decades, a 65-year-old movie that comes with more than an hour of commercials, than watch members of Hollywood’s Woketard Gestapo give shiny idols to other members of Hollywood’s Woketard Gestapo.

This is no fluke. These sexless, hideous, anti-art, anti-fun, anti-freedom, anti-joy Hollywood award shows are dying all over the place, as are movies that don’t put grown men in spandex.

Last month, the Woketard Golden Globe Gestapo Awards got wiped out by a 62 percent ratings crash. Only 6.03 million tuned in, just a little more than those who tuned in to watch Saturday’s 65-year-old Bible movie.

Last month, the Woketard Grammy Gestapo Awards got wiped out by a 53 percent ratings crash. Only 8.8 million tuned in.

Back in September, the Woketard Emmy Gestapo Awards got wiped out when only 5.1 million tuned in.

And coming up…?

The Big Daddy of Woketard Gestapo Awards arrives later this month — the Oscars, an award show that has been collapsing to new rating lows almost every year for the better part of a decade.

Naturally, Hollywood’s Woke Gestapo Propagandists are already writing blatantly dishonest pre-excuses for why this year’s Oscar ratings are going to hit an all-new bottom, and of course these little Himmlers are ignoring all the real reasons for this crash — like how the show is all lectures and no fun, all vacuous celebrities and no movie stars, all virtue signaling from The Worst People In The World and no magic.

Hey, Hollywood, we’re just hating you back.

You started it.

We’re all locked down in our homes dying for any kind of new entertainment, and we still prefer a 65-year-old movie over your self-celebrations. LOL. Kiss my ass.

269,CBS Studios Enters Production Deal With ‘Me Too’ Founder Tarana Burke,"CBS Studios has entered an overall deal with Black Lives Matter, gender equity advocate, and “Me Too” founder Tarana Burke, as well as her producing partner Mervyn Marcano. The anti-Trump Burke, and Marcano will partner with CBS Studios to develop scripted, unscripted, and documentary content, according to a report by Deadline.

The duo’s banner, Field/House Productions, is a “development and production home for stories that embrace complexity and highlight underrepresented voices,” and looks to promote narratives driven by storytellers who represent “the rest of us.”

“Creating space for new narratives has always been an integral part of cultural change work,” Burke said. “Field/House is a platform for those new narratives. This partnership gives us the reach and scale to ensure that we build new audiences for new voice.”

Marcano added that he and Burke are “thrilled to be building a powerful vehicle for inclusive stories with CBS Studios. Our goal has always been to create a pipeline of culturally progressive programming with our diverse network of creatives and storytellers.”

The new partnership is CBS’ latest social justice endeavor. CBS Studios recently entered a multi-year agreement with the NAACP to develop content that tells stories of the black American experience.

In the wake of mass rioting over the death of George Floyd, CBS also announced a partnership with a public safety group run by more than a half dozen Obama administration operatives to advise producers of its police dramas — such as NCIS and its spin offs, and Blue Bloods — on better ways to portray “modern policing.”

Moreover, CBS also committed last year to using 25 percent of its production budget to produce TV projects dedicated to “BIPOC” topics — an acronym for “Black, Indigenous, and People of Color” — and will increase the number of minorities in creative roles.

“In our quest to partner with compelling storytellers, Tarana and Mervyn stand out,” said David Stapf, President of CBS Studios, of the new partnership with Burke and Marcano.

“Their drive and leadership as stewards of change brings a powerful and distinct voice to advancing stories of inclusion and impact,” Stapf added. “They are clearly magnets for many whose voices need to be heard and we’re excited to work alongside them in this new venture.”

270,Aaron Sorkin: Americans Who Tolerate Trump Supporters Are Like Apologists for Racists,"Hollywood screenwriter and director Aaron Sorkin has smeared Trump supporters, tens of millions of Americans, as racists and bigots. Now he is attacking Americans who tolerate Trump supporters, claiming that they are akin to apologists for racists.

Aaron Sorkin made the bizarre comparison during a podcast interview with Michael Moore. At one point in the episode, the conversation turned to Sorkin’s recent Broadway play To Kill a Mockingbird, adapted from Harper Lee’s classic novel. In the interview, Sorkin claimed Atticus Finch repeatedly makes excuses for his racist neighbors.

“Atticus is an apologist for racists,” he said. “His whole thing about you have to walk a mile in someone’s else’s shoes. You rreally have to get inside someon’s skin and crawl around before you can really understand them. That was a way of excusing Bob Ewell… he excuses his neighbor Mrs. Henry Dubose… He excuses the whole South.”

Sorkin then compared Atticus Finch to Americans who tolerate Trump supporters. “All you had to do, Mike, was look around. We were all saying the same thing about the tens of millions of people supporting Donald Trump. I don’t get it. Yeah we’ve always disagreed, all of us here in Ameicaa. But we all have eyes and ears, right? We’re looking at the same person. What are you talking about?”

Listen below:

Michael Moore then echoed Sorkin’s point of view, saying Americans shouldn’t reach across the aisle to their political adversaries.

“No actually, I don’t need to understand why they’re racists. They’re racists.”

Aaron Sorkin was promoting his recent Netflix movie The Trial of the Chicago 7, which is nominated for six Academy Awards, including best picture and original screenplay.

In 2016, Sorkin described Trump’s election victory as a win for the Ku Klux Klan, white nationalists, sexists, racists, and “buffoons.”

“Angry young white men who think rap music and Cinco de Mayo are a threat to their way of life (or are the reason for their way of life) have been given cause to celebrate,” he wrote in a letter to his daughter published in Vanity Fair.

271,Jennifer Garner Teams With Jill Biden on Alabama Tour to Tout President’s Trillion Dollar Spending Plan,"Actress Jennifer Garner is slated to visit Alabama alongside First Lady Jilly Biden on Friday, where the pair are expected to tout the president’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan as part of the White House’s “Help is Here” tour, aimed to further detail the recently-passed coronavirus stimulus package to the American people.

The pair were supposed to visit the red state in March but the White House suspended the trip due to severe weather across the South. The original plan had the 13 Going on 30 star slated to visit both Jasper and Birmingham and speak on issues related specifically to childhood poverty alongside the first lady. They are now expected to visit the Birmingham area on Friday, April 9.

Garner has long-fawned over the first lady, gushing over the “dream” of Joe and Jill Biden in the White House during an Instagram live with Jill Biden in October.

“Can you imagine doing all that and having a husband or a spouse who is deployed somewhere else in the world?” Biden said during the discussion. “And all the meanwhile, here are the moms trying to do their jobs, teach online, help their kids online when they’re schooling and doing everything else. I think moms rule, don’t you?”

“Moms are gonna put you in the White House,” the actress said.

The Biden administration has continued to tout the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal, although Republicans have continually repeated that less than nine percent of the massive measure goes toward defeating the virus, specifically.

As House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said on the House floor last month, the measure “showers money on special interests, but spends less than nine percent on actually defeating the virus.”

“But it gives San Francisco $600 million, essentially wiping out 92 percent of their budget deficit. In both the House and Senate, the only bipartisan vote has been against it. And after 5 relief bills, it is on track to be the first passed by strictly party lines,” he said.

“Republicans have said that the bill before us today is costly, corrupt, and liberal. Now, even the Biden White House agrees: it is very liberal. They called it the ‘most progressive piece of legislation in history.’ So let’s be clear: This isn’t a rescue bill. It isn’t a relief bill,” he continued, describing it as a “laundry list of leftwing priorities that predate the pandemic and do not meet the needs of American families.”",1
272,Comedian Jamie Kennedy on His Role in ‘Roe V Wade’ Film: ‘I Got Educated on Certain Things’,"Comedian Jamie Kennedy discussed his role in the upcoming pro-life film Roe v. Wade, in which he mentioned that he “got educated on certain things” regarding the topic of abortion.

“When I started this movie, I was pro-choice. As I did this movie, I am still pro-choice, but I got educated on certain things that I have questions about, and I believe that, ultimately, it’s a woman’s right to choose. But I do have questions,” Kennedy said in a recent interview with Daily Beast.

Kennedy plays Larry Lader, an abortion-rights activist and founder of the NARAL Pro-Choice America organization, in Roe v. Wade. In the pro-life film, Lader is part of a behind-the-scenes cabal of activists pushing abortion to make money.

Kennedy added that the film’s producers, directors, and writers had informed him that everything in the movie was taken from books.

Kennedy also mentioned that some crew members — such as the director, first assistant director, costume designer, and location manager — abandoned the project after becoming uncomfortable with the film’s material.

“People would walk mid fuckin’ stream and say, ‘I didn’t know it was going to be this,’ and that’s not good,” Kennedy recalled during his interview. “And maybe you’re saying, ‘Hey Jamie, why didn’t you follow suit?’ and I guess because I just rode it out and wanted to see what the final product was.”

“I’m a guy who needs to be educated some more about politics. I’m not some guy in Hollywood who acts like they’re an expert about politics, and you can print that. I’m sick of that.”

Kennedy added that while a lot of people in Hollywood “were talking about this movie,” he is an actor, “first and foremost.”

“I act,” Kennedy affirmed, before going on to praise his co-star in the film, Jon Voight, who is known for leaning conservative. “I’ve worked with Jon Voight twice before, and he’s one of the greatest actors ever,” Kennedy said.

“People are gonna say what they’re gonna say,” he added. “I went into the movie as an actor with a very cool part that Hollywood doesn’t normally offer me.”

273,Britons to Be Forced to Pay for Covid Tests to Go on Holiday,"People in England can start thinking about foreign holidays, the transport minister has said. However, there will be mandated covid tests and potentially costly quarantining on return from higher coronavirus-risk nations.

Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC on Friday that international travel for holidays could resume no earlier than May 17th, and that terms for holidaymakers returning — i.e., whether they need to self-isolate at home or quarantine at a hotel — would be dependent on where the nation is classified in the government’s new ‘traffic light’ system.

Mr Shapps told Radio 4’s Today programme: “This is the first time I’m able to come on and say I’m not advising against booking foreign holidays.

“Yes, you’ll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks’ time when that list — the green, amber, red, is produced — you’ll want to know that you’ve got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it.”

In the following weeks, the government will categorise holiday destination nations from green to red, with red countries requiring the harshest restrictions for reentry.

Those arriving from green-list nations may not need to self-isolate on their return to the UK. However, they will need to take a test before departure and a PCR test on their return, and if positive, travellers will have to isolate.

Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, which need to be sent to a laboratory to test for new variants of the Chinese virus, can cost an estimated £120 a person — meaning nearly £500 extra added to the cost of a family holiday for four.

The Telegraph reports that even those who have had both doses of a coronavirus vaccine will still have to be tested on return because the government is reportedly concerned about new variants entering the country.

Boris Says Vaccine Passports for International Travel Will Be ‘Feature of Our Life in the Future’ https://t.co/wqpC8wX5fz — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 10, 2021

Amber country travellers will need to self-isolate at home for ten days on arrival, take the pre-departure test, and two PCR tests on days two and eight.

Red nation visitors will also have to take a pre-departure test, two PCR tests on days two and eight, and spend ten days quarantined in a government-approved hotel, which would substantially add to the cost of the holiday, at an estimated cost of up to £1,750 per person.

Sky News reports that holidaymakers must book their test packages in advance from government-approved suppliers.

Ministers are said to be looking at talking with industry to lower the costs of the tests and possibly later replacing them altogether with cheaper lateral flow swab tests, which can give results in around 30 minutes and do not need to be sent to a lab.

The plans saw backlash from the travel industry and MPs when revealed on Thursday night, with concerns that the costs would be prohibitively expensive.

Approximately 8,000 foreign tourists are arriving in the United Kingdom every day according to Border Force figures, while Britons are banned from taking holidays abroad. https://t.co/mlAYNjyf7O — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 6, 2021

Conservative MP Henry Smith, who represents some 100 cross-party lawmakers in the Commons and Lords from the Future of Aviation Group, said: “I remain concerned that this is unduly burdensome and costly for the average passenger.

“It won’t provide confidence for travellers to book up holidays from May 17. I think this will seriously impinge upon an aviation and travel revival, certainly for this spring and probably into summer.”

Reports from February claimed the government was working on immunity passports for international travel, which The Telegraph said could be used to bypass some of the hurdles to British holidaymakers. Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that vaccine certification for international travel was nothing new and would be “a feature of our life in the future”.

Currently, non-essential foreign travel is forbidden. In early March, the government rolled out rules that demanded those wishing to undertake international travel complete a lockdown exemption form to leave the country. Failure to provide the document when demanded for inspection at airports could result in a £200 fine.

This week, reports revealed that despite Britons currently being banned from non-essential international travel, some 8,000 foreign tourists are arriving in the country every day.",1
274,French Migrant Deportations At ‘Standstill’ Due To Coronavirus Pandemic,"Police in the French Yvelines department say they are overwhelmed with criminal migrants, as deportations have come to a “standstill” during the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.

Police in the department, located just outside of Paris, say they have been facing an influx of migrants, many of them claiming to be minors, for the last several months and said that accommodations for homeless migrants have become overwhelmed due to coronavirus.

“And if by chance, we prove that they are of legal age, it is the same problem. The evictions are at a standstill due to Covid,” one officer told Le Parisien.

In the commune of Mantes-la-Jolie, police have been called to several illegal squats but have found that as soon as they clear them, the area is soon taken over by other homeless young migrants.

In one case, a young migrant had been arrested nine times in just three months but was released every time, with the newspaper reporting that many claim to be underage to avoid criminal prosecution.

94 Per Cent of Foreign ‘Minors’ Identified by Paris Police Are Adults https://t.co/ZtYtLCsOID — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 18, 2021

According to one activist who works with an association helping homeless migrants, the commune has seen an explosion in numbers as many go unnoticed due to the already high proportion of people from migrant backgrounds in the area.

Two homeless migrants, both from Algeria, spoke to Le Parisien about their situation, saying that they had worked for €20 a day in local markets, but the pandemic has made it difficult for them.

“We were asked to sell drugs. They told us that because we are minors, nothing should happen to us if we get caught by the police. But we refused,” one of the migrants said.

Minor migrants, particularly from the North African region known as the Maghreb, have become a major security issue in some parts of France, where they have been disproportionately linked to robberies and violent crime.

In 2019 and 2020, following the easing of lockdown restrictions, asylum seekers from three North African countries made up 75% of the minor migrants arrested in Paris. https://t.co/2ydsPJT0TQ — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 14, 2021

According to a report released by French politicians Jean-François Eliaou and Antoine Savignat, Maghreb migrants make up as much as 75 per cent of the minor migrants arrested in the city of Paris.

The report also noted that many had lied about their age and estimated as many as half of those claiming to be 16 or 17 were actually above the age of 18.

The Directorate of Security of the Paris Metropolitan Area (DSPAP) later revealed that after working with police in North Africa, they had managed to positively identify 229 migrants claiming to be underage and found that 94 per cent of them were adults.",1
275,UK Govt Says Vaccine Certificates Will Be 'Feature of Our Lives',"The British government has claimed that immunity certificates will be a “feature of our lives” until the threat of Chinese coronavirus has passed and admitted that vaccine passports may still be required to go to pubs and restaurants in the future.

On Monday night, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the nation that the country was on track for its phased reopening, but played down the controversial proposal for vaccine passports for domestic use, discussions of which had been widely leaked to the press in recent weeks.

Outdoor hospitality venues will be reopening on Monday, April 12th. Following reports that Johnson had backed down on planned vaccine passports for pubs and restaurants to prevent a party rebellion, he told the nation last night: “There is absolutely no question of people being asked to produce certification, or covid status report, when they go to the shops or to the pub garden, or to the hairdressers or whatever on Monday.

He continued that the government was “not planning that for stage three either”, when indoor hospitality opens on May 17th, and “we’re not planning for anything like that, at that stage.”

However, that does leave the door open for covid certification for pubs and restaurants at ‘stage four’, with the government’s updated Roadmap Review released last night admitting: “It is possible that COVID-status certification could also play a role in reducing social distancing requirements in other settings which people tend to visit more frequently, for example in hospitality settings.”

Vaccine Passports Would Be State Reaching Too Far into Britons’ Lives, Warns Senior Tory MP https://t.co/iN8MGuNKv1 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2021

The document continued that “the Government recognises this has significant implications for businesses and their customers, so this will be further considered in consultation with industry, as part of the review of social distancing rules and taking into account the equalities and other impacts.

“For now, businesses should continue to plan to reopen in a way that follows the latest COVID-Secure guidance, and certification will not be required for reopening as part of step 2 or step 3.”

As reported last weekend, the covid certification app is said to be months away from being ready, possibly until the Autumn.

Further, the government document claimed that “COVID-status certification is likely to become a feature of our lives until the threat from the pandemic recedes”.

The Roadmap Review also said that banning businesses from demanding immunity passports from customers would be “an unjustified intrusion on how businesses choose to make their premises safe”, so “long as they are compliant with equalities legislation”. It added that there would “be exceptions where the Government needs to intervene to ensure equitable access to essential services”.

In appearing to justify the government possibly opening Pandora’s Box on domestic immunity IDs, the Review added: “It is therefore right that the Government provides a means of easily demonstrating COVID-status, in order to ensure UK citizens and residents are not denied opportunities to travel or attend certain venues or events.”

NHS Is Too ‘Incompetent’ to Protect Vaccine Passport Data, Says Brexiteer David Davis https://t.co/flABqC0528 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 5, 2021

It is now clear vaccine passports to do simple things like go to the pub or eat a meal out have been merely delayed, not defeated.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today and Sky News on Tuesday, Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi would not rule out vaccine passports for hospitality beyond June 21st, when all restrictions are supposed to be lifted — despite the prime minister saying on Monday that the Summer would see an “irreversible” return to normalcy.

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who is heading the review on vaccine certification, has allegedly privately promised MPs a vote on the measures if Johnson gives them the go-ahead. Around 41 Tories have already voiced their descent on the matter, but it would take an estimated 60 Conservative MPs and all opposition parties to stop the bill in the House of Commons; however, Labour has so far not settled its position on the scheme.",1
276,Labour Party to Vote Against Domestic Vaccine Passports: Report,"Labour MPs have reportedly been informed that the left-wing party will vote against the use of coronavirus vaccine passports, joining a Tory rebellion of around 40 MPs against Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s papers push.

A leaked internal Labour briefing said that the party would oppose efforts in the House of Commons to pass legislation for vaccine passports as they currently stand, with the party looking to focus on other measures to re-open the British economy.

The briefing, which was seen by the HuffPost, said: “On the basis of what we’ve seen we would oppose domestic vaccine passports.”

“Labour’s focus would be on getting the vaccine out, fixing self-isolation and contact tracing,” it added.

A senior Labour source said: “On the basis of what we’ve seen and discussed with ministers, we oppose the government’s plans for domestic vaccine passports.

“They appear poorly thought-through, will put added burdens on business and run the risk of becoming another expensive Whitehall project that gets outsourced to friends of Tory ministers.”

Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has previously said that to him, vaccine passports go against the “British instinct”; however, he has not publicly come out against the idea full stop.

The HuffPost report did go on to say that the party, which has largely backed the government on strict lockdown restrictions, is still open to backing a form of coronavirus certification, which would be based on testing rather than on vaccination status.

The opposition may ultimately be powerless to stop the vax pass scheme, however, as the leftist separatist Scottish National Party (SNP) has signalled that it would support the Conservative government’s efforts.

The leader of the SNP in the House of Commons, Ian Blackford, told The Telegraph: “Obviously we’re keen to take steps to get back to normality, but in a way that is inclusive. We would look constructively on any proposals that would help us get there, including Covid status checks.

“It is important that people are not excluded. Therefore such checks would have to include people who have had a Covid test as well as those who are vaccinated.”

While Scottish MPs typically refrain from voting on English matters, Blackford defended the move by saying: “When it comes to SNP MPs potentially voting on such matters in Westminster, these measures will affect Scots visiting friends or for work in England.”

Should the SNP join the Tories in the vote, then around 80 Conservative MPs would need to rebel against the government. At present, only 41 Tories have said they would vote against domestic coronavirus passports.

While Prime Minister Boris Johnson played down the idea of introducing health papers during the initial phases of his reopening plan, he did leave the door open to introducing them in the future, with the government even going so far as to say that COVID passes are likely to become a “feature of our lives”.

There has been growing opposition internationally to the draconian measures, with the World Health Organization (WHO) coming out on Tuesday against vaccine passports being used for international travel, as they say it is currently unknown how effective the inoculations will be in slowing the transmission of the Chinese virus.

In the United States, the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, banned the creation of a vaccine passport within the state through an executive order issued on Tuesday. Joe Biden’s Press Secretary Jen Psaki also claimed on Tuesday that the American federal government “is not now, nor will be, supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential”.

277,Majority of Britons Think Woke Royals Should Be Stripped of Titles,"The majority of Britons believe that Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, should be stripped of their titles, following a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey where the woke couple accused a member of the royal family of racism.

A Deltapoll study taken three weeks after the interview found that 58 per cent of Britons believe Meghan and Harry should have their royal titles removed.

At a ratio of less than one to two, just 28 per cent disagree, according to a report in The Mirror on Tuesday.

The findings are largely in line with other polling data. A survey commissioned by the Daily Mail and published in early March found that the majority (51 per cent) think that they should have their titles removed, compared to 28 per cent who disagreed.

A British YouGov poll from mid-March found that public opinion for Meghan and Harry had never been lower.

The Mirror reports that last month, Buckingham Palace officials were holding crisis talks to discuss whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex should lose their titles following the interview in which they made the claim that a member of the royal family had discussed the colour of their then-unborn son Archie and that Meghan had been denied mental health support.

Prince William hit back in defence of his family, telling reporters that “we are very much not a racist family.”

Queen Elizabeth II took the extraordinary move of issuing a statement saying that she was “saddened” by the impression Harry and Meghan had given of their lives in the interview but appeared to suggest that allegations regarding discussions related to Archie’s skin colour were not true, saying that “some recollections may vary”.

Buckingham Palace has hired external investigators to look into claims that Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, had bullied royal staff, with a source telling British media: “There are some harrowing stories to tell.” https://t.co/ejdNkAOBC4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2021

While the newspaper reports that Buckingham Palace courtiers discussed removing their courtesy titles, it would conflict with the Queen’s agreement that the couple could retain them, as they were gifts bestowed by the monarch on their wedding day.

Prince Harry would retain the title ‘prince’ and His Royal Highness (HRH), as he was born with them. If the dukedom were removed, Meghan could still be referred to as Princess Henry of Wales.

The Sun reports that they were stripped of some titles in February, just over a year after they announced they were stepping back from being working royals. Such titles included Prince Harry’s military appointments and other patronages.

Harry is still the sixth in line to the throne, behind his father, brother, and his brother’s three children, and it would take legislation to remove him from the succession.

It was also revealed on Wednesday that Harry and Meghan’s first Netflix series would be on the Invictus Games, an international sporting event for injured or wounded servicemen and veterans. Prince Harry first helped to set up the games in 2014, and the series, produced by the couple’s Archewell Productions, will likely focus on preparations for next year’s events.

Meghan and Harry already have a podcast deal with Spotify.

Last month, it was announced that Prince Harry had taken on two new roles, one as a member of a commission at an American think tank tackling fake news and the other as a chief “impact officer” at a Californian “mental fitness” coaching start-up.

279,Italy Scrambles to Salvage 2021 Tourist Season,"Italian government officials said Thursday tourism could reopen in Italy on June 2 “or even earlier” in an effort to salvage the 2021 tourist season after a year of crippling coronavirus restrictions.

Following a week of sometimes violent protests from restaurateurs and others in the tourist industry, Prime Minister Mario Draghi said in a press conference that although no date has been set in stone, Italy could reopen for business on June 2 or earlier.

“Let’s hope so, maybe even earlier, who knows,” Draghi said in response to a proposal for a June 2 reopening by Minister of Tourism Massimo Garavaglia.

“You can’t plan later. There are businesses that can open overnight and others that cannot, such as big hotels,” Garavaglia said on Italian television earlier on Thursday. “You need to monitor the data and, based on that data, open as soon as possible. We need to plan to be fast, otherwise others will pass us by.”

“They’re talking about July 14 in France and July 4 in the U.S.A.,” he said. “June 2nd is our national holiday and that could be the right time for us.”

“Last year we did not know what we were up against; this time we have experience and a vaccination plan that is moving forward,” he added. “We are working on a ‘Green Pass’ for those who have been vaccinated, have had COVID, or who test negative.”

The European Union has approved the use of a “Green Pass” for vaccinated citizens, a measure already in place on the Italian island of Sardinia.

Tourism makes up over 13 percent of Italy’s GDP and a year without visitors has left the industry and the many who depend on it languishing.

The ruling coalition and the opposition have discussed April 22 as a possible date for reopening of cafés, restaurants, and gyms, but no official announcement has yet been made.

Regional Affairs Minister Mariastella Gelmini told a wedding industry conference on Thursday that restrictions in Italy will be eased in a “major way” during May, noting that some limitations may be dropped as early as April 20.

“May should be the month for the reopening of economic activities and returning to life and we hope that on the basis of the data we can reopen some things in April as well,” Gelmini reiterated on Italian radio.

280,Sex Scandal Plagued Oxfam Suspended from Bidding for Taxpayers’ Cash,"The British government has suspended Oxfam from bidding for taxpayers’ cash after the charity confirmed it had suspended two staff amidst an investigation into corruption and sexual misconduct in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Oxfam had been receiving around £30 million a year in British taxpayers’ cash until it was revealed in 2018 that charity workers had engaged in the sexual exploitation of vulnerable women in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. Allegations of rape in South Sudan also surfaced that year.

Last week it was revealed that Oxfam was investigating abuse of power, sexual misconduct, and intimidation in the Congo — a month after the government cleared the charity to bid again for public funds after a three-year suspension.

Sources from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office told The Times on Thursday that Oxfam would again be temporarily blocked from accessing funds, pending the outcome of the investigation into the allegations related to the charity’s Congo mission.

A spokesman for the FCO told the newspaper: “All organisations bidding for UK aid must meet the high standards of safeguarding required to keep the people they work with safe.

“Given the most recent reports which call into question Oxfam’s ability to meet those standards, we will not consider any new funding to Oxfam until the issues have been resolved.”

Scandal-Plagued Oxfam Suspends Two Staff Amidst Misconduct Accusations in Congo https://t.co/47St3biMG5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 2, 2021

Whistleblowers in the Congo had become concerned that while an independent investigation had been opened in November, it has been six months without any findings. Further, the whistleblowers had said they had been raising their concerns over how the charity was operating since 2015.

In a letter sent to senior figures at Oxfam, former and current employees accused senior staff in the Congo mission of engaging in a “culture of bullying”, including the sexual harassment of female employees and managers having sexual relationships with subordinates.

The mission was also accused of corruption regarding the awarding of contracts for accommodation and travel and the hiring of contractors.

Whistleblowers also said that they had been victims of “threats to their lives and their families’ lives”.

Last week, the charity said: “We can confirm we have suspended two members of Oxfam staff in the DRC as part of an ongoing external investigation, which we set up last November, into allegations of abuses of power, including bullying and sexual misconduct.”

Aid Sector ‘Last Safe Haven’ for Sexual Predators, Says Report Following Oxfam Scandal https://t.co/xSlM6KaYSc — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 15, 2021

The Times also reported on Thursday that a British official, working for the UN’s peacekeeping mission in the DRC in 2017, who was accused of raping a minor had avoided prosecution, despite alleged compelling evidence against him.

It is claimed that the man had given a 16-year-old girl money and goods for sex. The girl’s mother told Congolese authorities, but after they appeared disinterested in pursuing the case, she contacted the United Nations’ mission in the DRC.

The UN’s Office of Internal Oversight Services investigated the claims and found them to be credible, and the man was dismissed.

The internal affairs unit report stated: “OIOS investigated a report that a staff member raped a 16-year-old Congolese female and, thereafter, continued to sexually abuse the victim by engaging in transactional sex in exchange for money and goods.

“The investigation substantiated the report and further substantiated a $5,000 settlement agreement between the staff member and the minor’s parent.”

The UK’s Ambassador to the UN Dame Barbara Woodward confirmed her office had referred the case to the National Crime Agency — Britain’s version of the FBI — which in turn consulted the Crown Prosecution Service. However, the NCA and CPS decided not to launch an investigation, with The Times saying it was understood to have been difficult for the case to reach the standard of proof needed by UK law.

A spokesman for the NCA told the newspaper: “The referral and available evidence were fully reviewed and the NCA assessed that there was no realistic likelihood of an investigation for an offence under the Sexual Offences Act (2003) meeting the criteria where it could be brought before the prosecutor for a charging decision.”",1
281,Leaders Call for Calm After Days of Northern Ireland Violence,"BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) – Crowds from Protestant and Catholic communities hurled bricks, fireworks and gasoline bombs at police and each other overnight in Belfast, as a week of street violence escalated. Police and politicians tried Thursday to calm the volatile situation in Northern Ireland, where Britain´s exit from the European Union has unsettled an uneasy political balance.

The focus of the violence, some of it committed by youths in their early teens, was a concrete “peace wall” in west Belfast that separates a British loyalist Protestant neighborhood from an Irish nationalist Catholic area. The two sides clashed across the wall, while nearby a city bus was hijacked and set on fire.

Police Service of Northern Ireland Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said several hundred people gathered on both sides of a gate in the wall, where “crowds … were committing serious criminal offenses, both attacking police and attacking each other.”

Northern Ireland has seen sporadic outbreaks of street violence since the 1998 Good Friday peace accord ended the Troubles – decades of Catholic-Protestant bloodshed over the status of Northern Ireland in which more than 3,000 people died. But Roberts said Wednesday’s mayhem “was at a scale we have not seen in recent years.”

He said a total of 55 police officers had been injured over several nights of disorder and it was lucky no one had been seriously hurt or killed.

The recent violence, largely in loyalist, Protestant areas, has flared amid rising tensions over post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland and worsening relations between the parties in the Protestant-Catholic power-sharing Belfast government. Britain´s split from the EU has renewed tensions over Northern Ireland’s status and disturbed the political balance in region, where some people identify as British and want to stay part of the U.K., while others see themselves as Irish and seek unity with the neighboring Republic of Ireland, an EU member.

U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the unrest, saying “the way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality.”

Northern Ireland´s Belfast-based assembly and government held emergency meetings Thursday and called for an end to the violence.

First Minister Arlene Foster, of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party, warned that “Northern Ireland faces deep political challenges ahead.”

“We should all know that when politics are perceived to fail, those who fill the vacuum cause despair,” said Foster, who heads the Northern Ireland government.

Deputy First Minister Michelle O´Neill, of Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein, called the violence “utterly deplorable.”

The latest disturbances followed unrest over the Easter long weekend in pro-British unionist areas in and around Belfast and Londonderry, also known as Derry, that saw cars set on fire and projectiles and gasoline bombs hurled at police officers.

Authorities have accused outlawed paramilitary groups of inciting young people to cause mayhem.

Roberts, the senior police officer, said some adults stood clapping and cheering while children as young as 12 or 13 rampaged.

The situation in Northern Ireland has been destabilized by Britain’s departure from the EU – after almost 50 years of membership – that became final on Dec. 31.

A post-Brexit U.K.-EU trade deal has imposed customs and border checks on some goods moving between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. The arrangement was designed to avoid checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland because an open Irish border has helped underpin the peace process built on the Good Friday accord.

Unionists says the new checks amount to a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. – something they fear undermines the region’s place in the United Kingdom.

Both Britain and the EU have expressed concerns about how the agreement is working, and the Democratic Unionist Party, which heads the Belfast government, wants it to be scrapped.

Katy Hayward, a politics professor at Queen’s University Belfast and senior fellow of the U.K. in a Changing Europe think tank, said unionists felt that “the union is very much under threat, that Northern Ireland´s place is under threat in the union and they feel betrayed by London.”

Unionists are also angry at a police decision not to prosecute Sinn Fein politicians who attended the funeral of a former Irish Republican Army commander in June. The funeral of Bobby Storey drew a large crowd, despite coronavirus rules barring mass gatherings.

The main unionist parties have demanded the resignation of Northern Ireland´s police chief over the controversy, claiming he has lost the confidence of their community.

“You have a very fizzy political atmosphere in which those who are trying to urge for calm and restraint are sort of undermined,” Hayward said.

“It´s really easy to see how it could get worse,” she added. “There´s many factors, including, obviously, criminal gangs at work who benefit from chaos like this. … So that you could see how things can definitely escalate.”",1
282,Ukraine’s Zelensky Visits Russian Border as Moscow Arms Up,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to his nation’s embattled Donbass region, where Russia-backed separatists have waged a years-long war to break from Kyiv, on Thursday following the death of a 23-year-old Ukrainian soldier.

Zelensky’s visit follows a week of mounting evidence that the Russian government is amassing tanks and other large-scale military hardware on the other side of the Donbass border. That build-up began after Zelensky signed an executive decree putting into motion a campaign to liberate Crimea, another Ukrainian region, from Russian occupation. Moscow “annexed” Crimea into Russia in 2014 after a brief invasion.

Zelensky has also escalated Kyiv’s campaign to join NATO, which would protect Ukraine by requiring all NATO members to engage militarily if it is attacked – potentially deterring a Russian invasion if an American counterattack is possible.

A statement from Zelensky’s office described his appearance on Ukraine’s eastern border as a “working trip” in which he will “visit the advanced positions, where the regime of comprehensive and permanent cease-fire has been systematically violated recently, and where Ukrainian defenders have been killed and wounded as a result of enemy shelling.” Zelensky also reportedly plans to meet soldiers fighting the Donbass separatists personally.

Donbass consists of the territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, both of which are home to separatist groups who claimed to have seceded, creating the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic,” in May 2014. Neither “republic” has gained any widespread recognition of its alleged sovereignty.

A nominal ceasefire had existed, with Russia’s blessing, in the region for a little less than a year until the Russian side refused all proposals to extend it past April 1. Ukraine reported nearly daily violations of that ceasefire and journalist reports from the field suggested it did not prevent significant combat there.

“As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, I want to be with our soldiers in the tough times in #Donbas,” Zelensky wrote on Twitter. “Going to the locations of the escalation. R.I.P. to the 23-year-old soldier who was shot last night. Ukraine needs peace and will do everything for this.”

Zelensky’s visit corresponds with mounting reports of Russian troop movements near the Ukrainian border. The Ukrainian Unian news agency reported on Thursday that evidence suggested some Russian weaponry had crossed into the hands of the Donetsk and Luhansk rebels and that Moscow had deployed “sniper squads” to the border.

“Two Ukrainian soldiers were mortally wounded on April 5 by a Russian sniper near the front line city of Zolote-4 and Avdiyivka, according to a statement by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Dylan Malyasov wrote for Defence Blog,” Unian reported on Thursday. “As UNIAN reported earlier, four Ukrainian servicemen that were part of a demining team were insidiously shot dead by enemy snipers on March 26.”

In addition to the snipers, the Ukrainian news agency reported on Thursday that Moscow appears to have constructed an entirely new field base near the Ukrainian border “completely filled with heavy weaponry.”

Locals and others present in the region have published videos in the past week online allegedly showing tanks and trains full of equipment rolling into the border area from the Russian interior. Moscow has not denied it but condemned the global interest in what it deemed domestic, sovereign matters.

“The Russian Federation transfers the Armed Forces on its soil as it wants to. This should not concern anyone and this is not posing any threat to anyone,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters last week. “The Russian troops have never taking part and are not participating in armed conflicts on Ukraine’s soil.”

On Thursday, Peskov reiterated that Russia’s troop movements were domestic affairs and conducted based on what is “necessary and expedient” for Moscow.

“Russia has never threatened and is not threatening anyone and poses no threat to anyone,” Peskov insisted.

The Russian government has also responded to Kyiv’s moves to restore Crimea to Ukrainian rule by warning that an illegally constructed bridge connecting the Crimean peninsula to Russia is highly fortified and not a weak target for Ukraine’s military. Kyiv vocally protested the bridge when it was completed in 2018, effectively allowing Russia to control ship traffic into key Ukrainian ports.

“The facilities of the Kerch transport link are today comprehensively protected on the ground, from the air and from the water and under the water,” Russian National Guard Chief Viktor Zolotov said in remarks to the Russian news agency Tass on Thursday. “The waters adjacent to this major transport artery are patrolled by National Guard boats while our combat swimmers inspect the bridge supports underwater. This is hard work and huge responsibility.”

The remarks appear to be a response to Zelensky’s executive order in late March initiating a “strategy for de-occupation and reintegration” of Crimea. The details of the strategy remain unclear, but Zelensky spokeswoman Yulia Mendel told reporters last week that it would require international support and that “dozens” of countries have already expressed a willingness to help Ukraine.

“The creation of the Crimean Platform has already been welcomed by such countries as Lithuania, Great Britain, Turkey, and many others — there are over a dozen [countries],” Mendel said.",1
283,Burma Ambassador Locked out of Own Embassy After Criticising Coup,"LONDON (AP) – Myanmar´s ambassador to the United Kingdom, who has criticized the military coup in his country, says he has been locked out of his London office by colleagues.

Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was barred from entering the embassy on Wednesday evening by diplomats loyal to the military regime.

Last month, the ambassador called for the release of Myanmar´s democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained when the military seized power on Feb. 1.

Since the coup, Myanmar security forces have killed at least 581 protesters and bystanders in their crackdown on opposition.

A statement read on Kyaw Zwar Minn´s behalf outside the embassy on Thursday said the embassy had been “seized by the military attache yesterday evening. The ambassador has been locked out since then.”

“There has been a coup in Myanmar in February and now the same situation in central London,” the statement said. “This is unacceptable and disrespectful not only to the people of Myanmar but it is also clearly disrespectful to all of democratic society in the U.K.”

British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab condemned the “bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime,” and praised the ambassador´s “courage.”

But it was unclear what, if anything, the U.K. could do about the move. The British government said it had been notified by Myanmar authorities that Kyaw Zwar Minn had been removed from his post.",1
284,Report: Pandemic Fueled ‘Vicious and Outrageous’ Antisemitic Discourse,"Antisemitic conspiracy theories in which Jews are blamed for the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant economic crisis have “skyrocketed” over the past year, a new report revealed.

The annual report from Tel Aviv University’s Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry said while Jews were more protected from physical assaults as a result of lockdowns and isolation, “new phenomena developed on the internet, such as zoom bombing and the darknet, which are difficult to quantify.”

The report also noted that while violent antisemitic events decreased from 456 (2019) to 371 (2020), a “20 percent increase was observed in desecrations of synagogues, graveyards and Holocaust memorials (which were closed or unguarded due to the lockdown and therefore easy prey for antisemitic vandalism).”

Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, said: “Anti-Jewish hatred online never stays online. We have to be prepared that anti-Semitic conspiracy theories could lead to physical attacks on Jews when lockdowns end.”

Many of the theories involved Jews and Israelis manufacturing and then spreading the virus as part of a plan to later save the world with expensive vaccines.

The report said:

The advent of the vaccines, coupled with Israel’s vast vaccination campaign, assisted by Israelis and Jews who hold prominent positions in the companies that produce these vaccines (such as Tal Zaks, Chief Medical Officer at Moderna, and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla), was used to reinforce these accusations: Israelis and Jews join hands so that Israel may be the first to recover from the pandemic, while the rest of the world stands in line and begs the Jews for help.

While efforts by social media giants like Twitter and Facebook to crack down on antisemitic and racist postings have led to a 50 percent drop since 2018, conspiracy theorists have moved as a result, leading “to a strengthening of undercurrents — namely, the darknet.” the report said.

“The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting reality dictated both the nature and extent of antisemitism in 2020, which was an unusually tense and turbulent year all over the world,” Prof. Dina Porat, the head of the Kantor Center, said in a statement.

“Prejudice, superstition, primordial emotions, and bizarre theories surfaced on the scene, and manifestations of antisemitism, both verbal and visual, were vicious and outrageous. Blaming the Jews and Israelis for developing and spreading the coronavirus (or ‘Judeovirus’), was the main motif in this year’s antisemitic manifestations. This notion is rooted in a deep fear of the Jew/Israeli as a spreader of disease in both the past and present.”

The report is released every year to coincide with Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day.",1
285,‘Sunset Clause’ Could Time Limit Vaccine Passport Mandate: Report,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly offering a time limit on vaccine passports in order to stop a Conservative Party rebellion in the House of Commons.

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove is overseeing a review of immunity passports and will update parliament on the plans by the end of this month.

A source close to the review told The Telegraph on Wednesday that in order to maintain the support of lockdown sceptics in the event of a parliamentary vote, ministers are considering making the vaccine passport legislation “explicitly temporary” through the use of “sunset clauses”.

This is the second time in the past week that government sources have leaked to the press that Johnson was considering a time limit to dissuade Tories voting against their party — suggesting that vaccine passports are certainly being given serious consideration and that the Johnson administration believes rebels can be won over by promising time limits on the extraordinary measures.

Such a vaccine passport, possibly accessed through a mobile phone app, could show whether a person had been vaccinated, had recovered from the Chinese virus and was naturally immune, or had recently tested negative.

The papers could be used to enter so-called non-essential businesses, like sports arenas and theatres, though the government has left open the possibility that they could be used to access hospitality venues — pubs and restaurants — with a Number 10 spokesman unable to state whether they may be needed to go into clothing retailers.

“The Government’s plans seem to be changing on an almost-daily basis. Only a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was saying he was thinking of vaccine passports to go to the pub – now he says isn’t… It’s a complete mess.” https://t.co/ctD0RCsC4o — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 8, 2021

Some 73 MPs have already said that they will oppose the measures, including 41 Conservative MPs. However, without a larger party rebellion and backing from the Opposition parties, the government could still pass vaccine passport laws.

The Liberal Democrats have already pronounced their resistance to the measures, with party leader Ed Davey saying: “Vaccine passports are actually Covid identity cards by the back door. They take away people’s freedoms.”

Opposition is also growing amongst the Labour Party, the House of Commons’ largest opposition party. A report from earlier in the week claimed that Labour MPs had been told that the party would vote against the proposals — though it is believed the left-wing party could support some other kind of certification related to testing rather than vaccination.

Party leader Keir Starmer is also more openly criticising the idea of vaccine passports, branding them as against “British instinct”, and condemning the government’s planning on the matter as a “complete mess”.

Starmer said on Wednesday: “We do not support the Government’s plans in their current form, it’s as simple as that.”

“In fact the Government’s plans seem to be changing on an almost-daily basis. Only a few weeks ago the Prime Minister was saying he was thinking of vaccine passports to go to the pub – now he says isn’t. One day he’s talking about tests – then it’s certificates. It’s a complete mess,” he said.",1
286,Former French Minister Predicts Le Pen Win in 2022 Elections,"Former French minister Arnaud Montebourg has claimed that populist party leader Marine Le Pen could win next year’s presidential elections.

Montebourg, who served as minister of industrial renewal under former President François Hollande from 2012 to 2014, stated that President Emmanuel Macron is “hated because he is arrogant” and added that Macron’s actions would lead to a victory for Ms Le Pen.

“It’s the same as the Trump phenomenon or Brexit,” Montebourg said and added that President Macron represented “the oligarchy”, and the French president merely posed as a “bulwark to the extreme right”, newspaper Le Figaro reports.

The former minister’s comments come after a shock poll released in January revealed that both President Macron and Ms Le Pen were almost neck and neck in polling in the first round of the presidential elections and in a head-to-head second round.

While the first round polling put Le Pen ahead of Macron by 27 per cent to 24 per cent, the French presidential system’s second-round run-off has made it incredibly difficult for outsider candidates in the past.

Poll: Le Pen and Macron Almost Neck and Neck in French Presidential Second Round https://t.co/TgMwEV379o — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 28, 2021

In 2017, when Le Pen made it through to the second round to face Macron for the first time, she lost by a considerable margin after some had predicted a possible win for the populist candidate, including investment bank Goldman Sachs. Two-round voting systems have the effect — either by design or not — of disadvantaging outsider candidates, as establishment voters of all stripes can cast aside their differences to vote in a moderate against an insurgent who may have managed to emerge from round one as the single most popular candidate but short of an overall majority.

Polls between Macron and Le Pen remain close, with an Ifop survey released on March 17th showing that Le Pen would win the first round of the vote with a clear lead of around 28 per cent, four points ahead of Macron at 24 per cent.

The poll also found that Le Pen would likely lose to Macron in a second-round run-off but notes that the share of the vote for Macron has fallen in recent months.

Support for Macron among the far-left supporters of Jean-Luc Mélenchon has also fallen since 2017, though nearly half said they would abstain from voting if Mélenchon did not pass through to the second round.

The poll also revealed that Paris’s left-wing mayor Anne Hidalgo would likely lose to Le Pen in a second-round vote due to many supporters of centre-right candidate Xavier Bertrand abstaining.",1
287,Turkey Denies Snubbing EU Prez Ursula at High-Level Summit,"ANKARA, Turkey (AP) – Turkey on Thursday strongly rejected accusations that it snubbed Ursula von der Leyen – one of the European Union´s most powerful executives – because of her gender, insisting that the EU’s own protocol requests were applied during a meeting at the Turkish presidential palace.

Von der Leyen – the European Commission president – and European Council chief Charles Michel met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for talks on Turkey-EU relations on Tuesday. The guests were led into a large room for discussions with Erdogan, but only two chairs had been set out in front of the EU and Turkish flags for the three leaders.

Von der Leyen stood looking at the men who took the chairs, expressing her astonishment with a “ehm” sound and a gesture of disappointment. She was later seen seated on a large beige sofa, away from her male counterparts.

The images drew intense criticism on social media and accusations of gender discrimination.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey had come under “extremely unfair” criticism over the visit and alleged slight shown to von der Leyen.

“Turkey is a deep-rooted state and this is not the first time that it has hosted a visitor,” Cavusoglu said. “The protocol applied during its (international) meetings is in line with international protocol rules as well as the world-renowned Turkish hospitality traditions.”

Cavusoglu insisted that Turkish and EU officials in charge of protocol had held meetings prior to the visit and that the arrangement was in line with EU requests.

“The protocol that was applied during the narrow-scope meeting that was held at our president´s office met the requests of the EU side. In other words, such a seating arrangement was made in line with the suggestions of the EU side. Period,” he said.

The Turkish minister added that he felt obliged to lay the blame on the EU publicly following accusations against Turkey from even “the highest levels of the EU.”

EU Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer said Wednesday that von der Leyen was surprised by the arrangement and that she should have been seated together with Michel and Erdogan.

“She decided to proceed nevertheless, prioritizing substance over protocol, but nevertheless let me stress that the president expects the institution that she represents to be treated with the required protocol,” Mamer said, adding that von der Leyen had asked her team to make contacts ensure that the incident is not repeated in the future.

Mamer also said Von der Leyen´s protocol team did not travel to Turkey with her due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Michel said late Wednesday that the embarrassment was the result of the “strict interpretation” by Turkish services of protocol rules, and he regretted “the differentiated, even diminished, treatment of the president of the European Commission.”

He said photographs of the meeting gave the impression that he was “indifferent” to the situation. “Nothing could be further from the truth, or from my deeply held feelings – or indeed from the principles of respect which I hold so dear,” he said.

“At the time, while realizing the regrettable nature of the situation, we decided not to make matters worse by creating a scene,” he said.",1
288,Palestinian Authority TV Claims Arabs Helped Jews Escape Nazis,"Ahead of Israel’s Holocaust Memorial Day on Thursday, a series of programs were aired on the Palestinian Authority’s official television network that spread lies about Jews, including the claim European Jews were helped by Arabs to escape the Nazis only to later betray them.

A separate program claimed Israel is “Judaizing” the West Bank town of Hebron and turning it into a Nazi style ghetto for its Arab residents.

“From the Israeli Archive” is a Palestinian program based a 1981 Israeli documentary series called Pillar of Fire. However, as monitoring group Palestinian Media Watch notes, the Palestinian version distorts or even mistranslates the original.

One recently aired episode recounts the mistreatment of Jews in Europe, culminating with the Nazis and their subsequent escape to Palestine.

The Jews “reached the land of Palestine hungry, sick, lacking everything, infected with typhus and malaria. We gave them fresh water to drink and fed them oranges, and they betrayed the hand that was extended to help them,” the host of the show said according to a translation by PMW.

Bizarrely, the same host later claims Jews fleeing Europe were not escaping persecution, but were seeking to “kill Palestinians” as part of a colonialist project.

“In Palestine there were only very few Jews who arrived fleeing diseases, hunger, and fear. The people of Palestine welcomed them… [but] that they were not people escaping who wanted to find refuge among the Palestinian people, but rather they are a colonialist project that wants to kill the Palestinians.”

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, said: “This portrayal of a generous welcome is a complete distortion of history. In fact, while Jews were fleeing Europe following the rise of the Nazi party in 1933, Arabs regularly attacked and killed Jews in British Palestine, climaxing in an intensive Arab terror campaign from 1936-1939.”

The Palestinian Authority often describes Israel as a “Nazi” state. It is part of a decades-old branding campaign in which the Palestinians claim Jews are now oppressing them in the same way that Jews were oppressed by the Nazis.

Another show on PA TV claimed Israel has turned Hebron into a “ghetto… similar to those of the Nazi period.”

“The occupation has significantly succeeded in Judaizing a large part of Hebron and turning Hebron into a ghetto,” a self-proclaimed “human rights defender” said on the program Lovers of the Land.

“We must dismantle this ghetto, which is the settlements, and which is similar to the Nazi period,” he added.

Palestinian Authority officials have in the past claimed Israel is guilty of perpetuating a “second holocaust” against the Palestinians.

Jews occupy less than three percent of Hebron. The rest of the city is exclusively Palestinian. Jews have lived in Hebron almost continuously for over 3,000 years.

The holy town is also the site of the Tomb of the Patriarchs, where the Jewish Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are buried, along with their wives, according to Jewish tradition.

Israel on Thursday morning came to a standstill as sirens blared throughout the country in memory of the six million Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust.",1
289,Salvage Crew Regain Control of Drifting Ship Carrier After Engine Failure,"HELSINKI (AP) – Despite heavy seas, a joint Norwegian-Dutch salvage operation has managed to get an abandoned Dutch cargo ship under control off the coast of Norway and was towing the ship to port on Thursday.

Norwegian officials said the rescue operation of the Eemslift Hendrika, a Netherlands-registered ship designed to carry large boats, was completed early Thursday and the ship is slowly being towed to the western city of Alesund.

The ship’s crew of 12 was rescued by helicopter late Monday after a power outage in its main engine. The Norwegian Coastal Administration, based in Alesund, launched salvage operation late Wednesday as it became clear that churning seas could make the drifting ship crash into the shore.

The vessel has substantial quantities of diesel and fuel in its tanks, which could have caused an environmental disaster. Norwegian maritime authorities issued an emergency alert late Wednesday and started preparations in case of an oil spill.

The Eemslift Hendrika was adrift in the area where the North Sea and Norwegian Sea meet. Salvage experts were lowered onto the sharply listing ship Wednesday to attach towing ropes to waiting tug boats.

One large boat aboard the deck of the 6-year-old cargo ship fell off in heavy seas Tuesday but was found by the Norwegian coast guard and secured to another tug boat.",1
290,Albanian Drug Gangsters Claiming to be Slaves to Skirt Jail Time: Report,"Members of Albanian drug gangs are reportedly claiming to be victims of modern slavery to avoid serving jail time in Britain, as they continue their push to corner the marijuana black market.

Albanian “gardeners” are being brought into the country illegally to staff massive grow houses, equipped with booby-traps in barbed-wire protected compounds. Once in the country, the workers are then provided access to a network of “professional enablers”, including accountants, translators, and solicitors.

A report from the London Times said that the foreign gangsters are increasingly taking advantage of a legal loophole in the National Referal Mechanism for modern slavery, telling officers once caught that they were forced to grow the drug by higher-ups in the organisation.

Through this, the growers are able to avoid jail time and are instead transferred into publicly funded housing meant for victims of human trafficking.

An officer from the National Crime Agency (NCA) task force on Balkan criminality told the paper: “It’s really contentious whether those claims are valid or not… something that’s investigated quite frequently.”

The officer went on to say that the Albanians have also moved into the cocaine trade, with piles of cash in profit being shipped back to their native country.

Assistant Chief Constable Dave Kirby of the Derbyshire constabulary confirmed that Albanian criminals often employ the tactic of claiming to be victims of slavery, saying: “There’s no doubt that it’s a well-known tactic.”

“You’ve got to imagine that these very well-organised criminal groups will be smart enough to say, ‘All right, this is what we do then — everybody, this is what you say,’” the ACC added.

In one example, Armelind Rexha, a 22-year-old who came to the UK on a student visa, successfully convinced a British judge that he was forced into running a £672,000 pot farm, thereby escaping jail time.

Albanian Gangsters Linked to South American Cartels Taking Over British Drug Scene https://t.co/cviZnY1AK4 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 11, 2018

Last year, some 10,613 people were identified as possible victims of human trafficking, modern slavery, or forced labour in the UK, 452 of whom were from Albania, the Home Office revealed.

The Home Office said that they have also seen an “alarming increase” in illegal migrants attempting to claim the status in order to evade deportation or being placed in migrant detention centres.

Breitbart London reported last May, that Albanians have become the number one foreign ethnic group in British prisons, with Conservative MP Philip Hollobone saying at the time: “The importation of Albanian criminals into the UK over the last ten years has been one of the scandals of the decade.”

Over the previous three years, the Albanian drug gangs have used violence, kidnappings, and firearms to take control of the marijuana trade in Britain, which was previously dominated by Vietnamese cartels.

The NCA said that Albanian strongholds in the north of England have grown “exponentially” over the past few years, as well as dominating the weed trade in London and the South East.

Armed Albanian gangs are also said to be running human trafficking operations in migrant camps across the English Channel in Calais, France, facilitating more illegal boat migration to the UK.

A government source said that the latest report justified Home Secretary Priti Patel’s push to reform the modern slavery regulations, saying: “This is proof of how dangerous criminals and gangsters are increasingly abusing our world-leading modern slavery laws.”

The Home Secretary is currently looking to introduce a new “public order” definition, which would empower the British legal system to deny NRM protections to those who pose a national security risk or have committed a serious crime.

291,Just 8% of Brits Felt Comfortable Having Physical Contact with Others,"Fewer than one in ten Britons said they felt comfortable having physical contact with others when the occasion arose during the pandemic.

YouGov asked 4,085 adults in Britain on Wednesday whether they had had “physical contact (e.g. a hug or handshake) with someone in the last year out of politeness, despite not wanting to because of Covid”, with more than one-in-five (21 per cent) saying they had touched another person, despite not wanting to.

Eleven per cent said they avoided physical contact when the situation arose, either explaining why they would not touch someone or simply not reciprocating the gesture.

Just eight per cent had admitted they felt “comfortable having physical contact despite Covid” and did not avoid hugs or handshakes. While 56 per cent said that in a whole year, they had not themselves in that position.

The findings are similar to those in the past year, which point to a fearful population keen for stricter lockdown measures.

In September, after a poll found nearly two-thirds of Britons backed a 10 pm curfew for pubs, an anonymous Conservative MP said that the government’s messages on the Chinese coronavirus had made Britons “fearful”, driving them to support “authoritarian” measures.

More Big Govt, Please: Majority of Britons Don’t Think Vax Passports Infringe Personal Freedoms https://t.co/rEy7CG1XaS — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 1, 2021

Other polls in the past twelve months have shown citizens backing mandatory vaccines in employment contracts, harsher penalties for those deemed to have broken lockdown rules, and tracking people subject to quarantine via their mobile phone.

Last month, lockdown sceptic Conservative MP Desmond Swayne said he found it “unnerving” the enthusiasm with which “people have embraced the diminution of their civil liberties and their ordinary lives”.

A March poll found that a majority of Britons, a combined 55 per cent, said they would miss lockdown, of which 46 per cent said they would “miss some aspects of lockdown”, and nine per cent said they would miss “many” aspects of it.

With the Conservative government travelling in the direction of imposing immunity certificates, otherwise known as vaccine passports, it is down to a few dozen Tory rebels and the opposition of Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and others to stop it.

However, Labour and the Lib Dems are apparently out of step with the public on immunity certificates. According to another YouGov poll from Tuesday, a combined 58 per cent back vaccine passports, with strong majorities amongst Tory, Lib Dem, and Labour voters.",1
292,China Imprisons Uyghur Woman for Crying over Jailed Husband,"The wife of an imprisoned Uyghur taxi driver was herself arrested and sentenced to at least three years in prison for weeping while she told her story to a foreigner during a bus ride.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been working hard to conceal the oppression of the Uyghurs from outsiders.

Radio Free Asia (RFA) reported Wednesday that Munira Memtili’s husband Shireli was arrested in 2018 and sentenced to 200 months in jail in May 2019 because he accepted a “religious figure” as a passenger and allegedly received “illegal religious education” from him. The Uyghurs are predominantly Muslim.

Shireli Memtili’s mother is also reportedly in prison, serving a ten-year sentence for “moving her household” from one county to another, presumably without the necessary official permission.

According to RFA’s sources, Munira Memtili, left alone to care for the couple’s two four-year-old children, drew the attention of officials in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) when she asked the police for permission to hold a video chat with her husband, who is imprisoned in a different city.

When the police refused her request, the heartbroken Munira took a bus ride home and wound up telling her story to her seatmate, a businesswoman from Kyrgyzstan, which borders on the XUAR. Munira burst into tears, drawing a sharp reprimand from the bus driver to avoid upsetting “the mood of foreign guests.”

The bus driver turned Munira in to the police, who reportedly showed up at her home the next day, threw a black bag over her head, dragged her down to the station, and charged her with “revealing state secrets.” The authorities described her as a subversive agent working “masterfully” to undermine the Chinese state.

A month later, the police ominously returned to the Memtili home to collect all of her clothing, and later they sealed the door to the residence. Her neighbors assume she has been taken to one of the XUAR’s infamous concentration camps, but according to RFA, “no one dared to ask about her case lest they themselves be targeted.” Visitors to the XUAR have reported seeing entire residential complexes, and entire towns, sealed in the same manner after the residents were herded into concentration camps.

One local source told RFA he heard rumors Munira could be jailed for up to ten years. Local officials refused to discuss her case, or those of her husband and mother-in-law, with RFA beyond confirming she has been jailed and insisting the sentence is only for three years.

The Memtili children were reportedly placed in the care of Shireli’s father, who was arrested at the same time as his mother but released after spending over a year in the camps.

Uyghurs in Australia were outraged on Wednesday when the Chinese embassy in Canberra held a press conference to debut a series of propaganda films about the XUAR unsubtly entitled Xinjiang Is a Wonderful Land. The films used Uyghurs to deny all of the human rights complaints leveled at China, which Chinese officials said were based on “fake news and misinformation.”

Australian Uyghur residents, some of whom have spent time in the camps or been forcibly separated from their families, like Munira and Shireli Memtili have, reacted with shock and anger to the Chinese embassy presentation.

“I call on the Australian government and the public to be shamed for allowing the Chinese government to have such a big platform in a democratic country to spread its political agenda,” said East Turkistan Australian Association president Nurmuhammad Majid, who said he personally has at least twenty relatives imprisoned in the Xinjiang camps.

Several Uyghur women who fled Xinjiang told the Atlantic on Thursday their imprisoned husbands and other family members are used as leverage against them by the Chinese government, and they feared Beijing’s growing power is making formerly supportive nations such as Turkey more reluctant to grant Uyghurs asylum.",1
293,South Korean Leftists Take Major Hit in Mayoral Elections,"South Korea’s ruling, left-wing Democratic Party (DP) suffered a “crushing” defeat on Wednesday in two mayoral by-elections viewed by political observers as a bellwether for the country’s presidential election next year.

“Oh Se-hoon of the main [right-wing] opposition People Power Party (PPP) defeated his rival from the DP, Park Young-sun, 57.5 percent to 39 percent to claim the Seoul mayoral seat,” according to a final vote tally released by South Korea’s National Election Commission on April 8. “The mayoral seat in Busan, the country’s second-largest city, also went to the PPP, with Park Heong-joon beating DP rival Kim Young-choon 63 percent to 34 percent.”

“The PPP also swept 13 of 19 other local posts up for grabs in the elections,” South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported.

Seoul is home to 10 million people, nearly one-fifth of South Korea’s total population of 52 million, meaning the city’s mayoral elections often serve as a strong indicator for the direction the country’s presidential election may take. South Korea’s next presidential poll is slated for March 2022.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in and his leftist ruling party “have been grappling with public outrage and falling support over spiking housing prices and a scandal involving public housing development officials, which erupted a month before Election Day [April 7],” Yonhap noted Thursday. “The DP’s recent railroading of progressive bills, including those on weakening the power of the state prosecution service, has also drawn heat.”

Seoul and Busan called for Wednesday’s mayoral by-elections after the previous mayors of both cities – Park Won-soon in Seoul and Oh Keo-don in Busan, both members of the DP – vacated their posts in 2020 amid sexual harassment allegations. Oh resigned from his post, and Park was found dead of an apparent suicide.

“Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and considered a potential presidential contender for 2022, died by suicide in July as sexual abuse allegations by his former secretary went public,” UPI recalled on Thursday. “Busan Mayor Oh Keo-don, also a member of the Democratic Party, resigned last April after admitting to sexual assault of a public servant during a meeting in his office.”

The PPP-member mayors elected in Seoul and Busan this week will serve out the remaining 14 months of the previous mayors’ four-year terms.

President Moon said Thursday he had taken his ruling party’s defeat on Wednesday as a “reprimand” from the public. Moon vowed to carry out his presidential duties with a “humbler demeanor and heavier sense of responsibility,” in a statement released by his spokesman. The DP’s top leaders resigned en masse Thursday to “take responsibility” for the party’s resounding loss. “Taking responsibility for the results of the elections, all (members of) the DP leadership are stepping down,” Rep. Kim Tae-nyeon, the Democratic Party’s acting chairman and floor leader, told reporters at a press conference on April 8.",1
294,India Claims to Lead World in Daily Coronavirus Vaccinations,"India is vaccinating more people daily against the Chinese coronavirus than any other nation, the country’s health ministry said on Thursday.

“In terms of the number of daily doses administered globally, India stands at the top with an average of 3,430,502 doses administered per day,” India’s Ministry of Health said in a statement released April 8.

“Cumulatively, 90,198,673 vaccine doses have been given so far through 1,377,304 sessions,” the statement read.

“In its collective and collaborative fight against the global pandemic, India has crossed a landmark milestone under the world’s largest vaccination drive, which was launched on January 16 this year,” the health bureau said. “The cumulative number of COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 9 crore [90 million].”

“Eight states — Maharashtra, Rajastha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala — account for 60 percent of the total doses given so far in the country,” the Press Trust of India reported on Thursday.

India launched what it branded as the world’s largest Chinese coronavirus vaccine drive on January 16 with the goal of vaccinating at least 300 million people, a fraction of the country’s total population of nearly 1.4 billion. Indian health officials vaccinated roughly half a million people within the campaign’s first day, according to the United Nations.

India on January 4 approved for emergency use two coronavirus vaccine candidates — one developed by Oxford University and the U.K.-based drugmaker AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India called “Covishield,” and another produced by the Indian company Bharat Biotech called “Covaxin” — to distribute as part of the campaign.

“Cargo planes flew 16.5 million shots to different Indian cities last week,” the Associated Press reported on January 16.

“We are launching the world’s biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a nationally televised speech to kickstart the inoculations.

Modi received his second dose of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi on April 7 after receiving his first dose of the inoculation on February 28.

Got my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine at AIIMS today. Vaccination is among the few ways we have, to defeat the virus. If you are eligible for the vaccine, get your shot soon. Register on https://t.co/hXdLpmaYSP. pic.twitter.com/XZzv6ULdan — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) April 8, 2021

Indian health regulators approved Covaxin for emergency use on January 4 before the vaccine candidate had completed Phase III clinical trials. Modi publicly endorsed Covaxin before its manufacturer, Bharat Biotech, released final stage clinical data on its efficacy rate and safety on March 3, showing the vaccine to be 81 percent effective against the Chinese coronavirus.",1
295,China Admits to Major Coronavirus Outbreak in South,"A week after news reports began surfacing of a growing Chinese coronavirus outbreak in southern Yunnan province, Chinese state media confirmed Thursday that the Communist Party chief in Ruili, the city where the outbreak began, lost his job for “serious negligence in epidemic control.”

Dictator Xi Jinping declared an official end to the Chinese coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan, central Hubei province, in March 2020, visiting the city months after the worst of the outbreak had ended there. Beijing has repeatedly attempted to project an image of total control over the pandemic since then, evading complete counts of coronavirus cases while occasionally admitting to the reality that widespread infections were ongoing. China most dramatically attempted to claim a complete victory over the epidemic with a mass celebration in Wuhan for New Year’s Eve, covered extensively around the world with more fanfare than the subsequent outbreak that followed the super-spreader event.

The current outbreak is occurring in a province that borders Myanmar, currently rocked by protests and a violent military response after a coup deposed its democratically elected government in February.

The Chinese state-run Global Times publication revealed on Thursday that the head of the Communist Party in Ruili, Gong Yunzun, had lost his job over the health situation there, an embarrassment for Beijing. As of Thursday, the newspaper claimed the city had documented 76 coronavirus cases “and 25 asymptomatic patients;” the newspaper did not clarify if this meant officials had confirmed 100 cases or if the 25 were counted in the 75 total. Ruili has a population of about 300,000 people.

The propaganda outlet claimed that Gong’s dismissal was not just the result of the current outbreak, but of the fact that today’s is the third such incident in the past six months there.

“Gong took the post of Party Committee Secretary of Ruili in April 2018. He has now been demoted to a first-level researcher,” the newspaper reported. The notification did not suggest any further action, such as prosecution, though the Party under Xi has moved routinely to prosecute individuals considered potential threats to Xi on dubious charges of “corruption” following limited investigations.

China Daily, another government propaganda outlet, accused Gong personally of having “seriously impacted and damaged the overall situation of epidemic prevention and control in the whole country,” citing the local Party officials who removed him from office.

Following the local official’s removal, Beijing announced a major deployment of health workers from other parts of the country into Ruili to prevent the outbreak from further embarrassing the regime.

“Thousands of medics have been called in to join the anti-pandemic fight in Ruili, China, where a new cluster of COVID-19 [coronavirus] cases have recently been reported,” the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday. “The city has also been conducting large-scale nucleic acid testing along with home isolation, vaccination and epidemiological survey to curb the epidemic.”

Gong and the mayorship of Ruili had moved to completely lock down the city last week, and shut down border crossings, after doctors began rapidly confirming coronavirus cases, some in a sizeable number of Myamar citizens who appear to have crossed the border in the chaos following February’s military coup. The lockdown banned all businesses from opening other than markets for food and drugs and prevented individuals from leaving their homes, save for a once-a-day trip by one person in each household for food and other necessities. Reports rapidly began surfacing of desperate residents fighting over food in supermarkets.

Local officials also made the outrageous promise that they would vaccinate the entire population of Ruili in five days last week, broadcasting images allegedly of long lines of enthusiastic residents waiting for coronavirus vaccine candidate doses. China has approved five different vaccine candidates for widespread use domestically and focused largely on exporting two of its candidates — “Coronavac,” by the firm Sinovac Biotech, and a competitor from the firm Sinopharm — to allied and underdeveloped nations. Coronavac is notoriously the least effective vaccine currently available on a global scale, testing at only 50.38 percent efficacy; vaccines must pass a 50-percent threshold for most experts to consider them worth approving.

“No detailed efficacy data of Sinopharm’s [Chinese coronavirus] vaccine has been publicly released but its developer, Beijing Biological Products Institute,” Reuters reported in late March, “said the vaccine was 79.34% effective in preventing people from developing the disease based on interim data.”

In comparison, both vaccines developed by American companies Pfizer and Moderna tested at over 94-percent efficacy in preventing infections.

While the Communist Party has successfully convinced dozens of countries to purchase its homemade vaccine candidates, vaccination rates in China have stagnated, in large part due to Chinese citizens’ high levels of distrust in Chinese-made pharmaceutical companies. Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Beijing was contending with a major scandal in which Changsheng Biotechnology, a Chinese company, was caught watering down doses of basic children’s vaccines to make a profit, leaving as many as 1 million children exposed to diseases like whooping cough (pertussis) and rabies. The incident caused widespread outrage at the Communist Party and, in at least one case, a gang beating of a local Communist Party official at the hands of angry parents.

Low interest in China’s coronavirus vaccine candidates is also a product of Beijing repeatedly claiming it had defeated its internal coronavirus outbreak, giving the impression that a vaccine is unnecessary.

To combat vaccine apathy, some local officials have begun either bribing residents with food and other gifts or threatening them with public shamings if they opt out of vaccination.

296,Boxer Manny Pacquiao Urges China China to Stop Philippines Invasion,"Philippine Senator Manny Pacquiao on Thursday urged China to halt its “creeping occupation” of the Philippines’ Juan Felipe Reef in the South China Sea and recall a fleet of Chinese fishing vessels moored near the structure since early March.

“Its [China’s] militia fishing boats that have encroached in areas surrounding the [Julian Felipe Reef]. … As a friend and neighbor, I appeal to the Chinese leadership to stop this creeping occupation and use your authority to disperse these Chinese fishermen,” the senator said in a statement issued April 8.

Pacquiao said he backed Philippine Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana’s formal appeal to Beijing on March 21 to disperse its vessels from Juan Felipe reef.

“We call on the Chinese to stop this incursion and immediately recall these boats violating our maritime rights and encroaching into our sovereign territory,” Lorenzana said in a statement.

The Philippine military believes the 220-strong fishing fleet anchored at Juan Felipe Reef since at least March 7 is manned by Chinese maritime militia members. Juan Felipe Reef is located within the boundaries of the Philippines’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which grants Manila the sole rights to fishing and natural resource gathering in the region. Beijing illegally lays claim to Juan Felipe Reef, as it does to nearly 90 percent of the contested South China Sea.

Sen. Pacquiao said on April 8 that China and the Philippines “must stand together” to find a peaceful resolution to the South China Sea dispute, which is an issue “that concerns the whole of Asia.”

“This matter on territorial claims … affects practically all nations in our continent. China can and will elevate itself as Asia’s unifying force if it starts to heed existing international laws including the UNCLOS,” Pacquiao said, referring to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

China’s claims to nearly all of the South China Sea were ruled illegal by an independent arbitral tribunal established under UNCLOS in 2016. Beijing refected the ruling in the case, brought by the Philippines, and continued to push forward with its belligerent occupation of other nations’ territory in the disputed waterway ever since.

“Instead of expanding and occupying disputed territories, China should sustain building its goodwill and friendship towards its neighboring nations so that our whole region can look up to it as one of the world’s respectable global powers,” Sen. Pacquiao said Thursday.

If China withdraws its ships from Juan Felipe Reef, the action would “show a neighborly gesture of mutual understanding and true friendship,” the senator added.

Manila repeatedly urged Beijing to recall its fishing boats from Juan Felipe Reef since the Philippine Coast Guard first spotted the fleet “moored in line formation” near the structure on March 7. China refused to move the vessels, forcing the Philippine military to order regional “maritime sovereignty patrols” near Juan Felipe Reef in recent weeks. The defensive security measures include daily flyovers by Philippine fighter jets.

297,Myanmar’s Celebrities Become Face of Anti-Coup Protests,"The military junta in Myanmar on Thursday arrested 24-year-old model and actor Paing Takhon, hailed as “the most handsome person in Southeast Asia” by fans, because he criticized the coup.

Two days earlier, Myanmar’s most famous comedian was arrested for similar reasons, joining dozens of celebrities languishing in jail because the junta is desperate to deprive the protest movement of star power.

Takhon was taken into custody by eight truckloads of police and soldiers at his home in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city. His sister asked supporters to pray for him, as he said he was in poor health before he was arrested.

“As he’s seriously ill, they arrested him calmly without violence. We do not know where he’s taken,” Takhon’s sister Thi Thi Lwin wrote on Facebook.

In one of the pictures below, Takhon is making the three-fingered salute of defiance against tyranny from the Hunger Games books and movies, a gesture popular with protesters in Myanmar:

Another actor, May Toe Khine, demanded freedom for Takhon, the popular comedian Zarganar (real name Maung Thura) who was arrested a few days previously, and numerous other entertainers who have been taken into custody.

A total of 120 celebrities have been arrested or placed on a wanted list by the military. State media has published even longer lists of entertainers and social media influencers charged with “spreading news to affect state stability.” All Burmese media outlets have been ordered not to broadcast content featuring the blacklisted celebrities, from songs to movies and TV shows.

“The military wants people to love them, to be afraid of them, to respect them, so it will make arrests, torture, or kill the artists, but most of us will be ready to fight against the evil,” a blacklisted poet told Radio Free Asia (RFA).

International beauty pageant contestant Han Lay told RFA she was afraid to return to Myanmar after competing at a pageant in Thailand, since she spoke out against the coup while she was there.

“If singers and celebrities can get arrested just for writing posts on social media, how can a person like me, who has come to Thailand to represent the country at a pageant and talk to the international media like this, be safe?” she said.

Takhon is regarded as the most famous and influential of the jailed dissidents to date. He represents several local brands, has a television career in Thailand, and has served as a cultural ambassador for Myanmar. Comedian Zarganar, who is 60 years old, has the distinction of getting arrested by both the current and previous military regimes.",1
298,Kim Jong-un Calls for ‘Arduous March’ to Overcome Economic Woes,"North Korean state media on Friday quoted dictator Kim Jong-un telling members of his totalitarian Workers’ Party (WPK) to prepare for an “Arduous March” against economic hardship.

The term “Arduous March” holds ominous significance for North Koreans, as it refers to a period of mass starvation in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

According to some estimates, millions of North Koreans died during the original Arduous March famine — the exact number is difficult to discern, given the paranoid Communist regime’s penchant for secrecy and lies — so Kim’s comments were on par with telling his subjects to prepare for a new Black Plague or Great Leap Forward.

South Korea’s Yonhap News translated North Korean state media reports that portrayed Kim as using the Arduous March as a rather gruesome metaphor for steely collectivist determination against difficult challenges:

“I made up my mind to ask the WPK organizations at all levels, including its Central Committee, and the cell secretaries of the entire party to wage another more difficult ‘Arduous March’ in order to relieve our people of the difficulty,” Kim was quoted as saying in the official Korean Central News Agency. “Our Party never expects that there will be any fortuitous opportunity for us in paving the road for our people and in realizing their great aim and ideals to build socialism and communism. There is nothing we could depend on or look to,” he said. He then laid out 10 major tasks for the party cells, urging the cell secretaries to patiently educate and train their members into “fighters boundlessly faithful” to the party. “Just as mothers always concern themselves with the life and growth of their children and guide them along the right path, party cell secretaries should patiently educate and lead party members with warm affection and devotion,” he said.

South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Cha Deok-Cheol speculated that Kim referenced the 90s famine to “encourage efforts to achieve the tasks put forward” by recent meetings of the WPK, while Yonhap suspected his goal was “intensifying discipline among party officials as the North suffers from economic challenges amid prolonged sanctions.”

Along the latter lines, Kim demanded more “ideological education” for North Korean children, who already receive a great deal of such indoctrination and a more intensive purge of “anti-socialist and non-socialist practices.”

Kim said last week that North Korea faces its “worst-ever situation,” a bold statement in light of that horrendous famine decades ago.

Among North Korea’s many problems is the regime’s stubborn insistence that it has encountered exactly zero cases of coronavirus, even as lockdown measures visibly tightened and North Korea’s all-important trade with China virtually ceased. The North Korean government informed the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) on April First that it performed over 23,000 coronavirus tests, and every single one of the results was negative.

North Korea’s already weak economy slipped by over ten percent last year, while its trade with China shrank by about 80 percent, all because of a disease Pyongyang claims it doesn’t have a single case of.

The UK Guardian cited theories that Kim’s reference to the Arduous March famine was a way of signaling China that he expects Beijing to feed his people, or else suffer the consequences of North Korean refugees streaming across the Chinese border. Chinese President Xi Jinping made comments last month that could be construed as a promise to help Kim avert mass starvation so North Korea can continue pretending it is the only country that went completely untouched by the Wuhan coronavirus.

Former U.S. government analyst Rachel Lee told the Financial Times on Friday that Kim’s remarks were meant as a signal that his regime has no intention of asking the United States for assistance, relenting on his nuclear weapons program, or striking a deal to gain relief from sanctions.

“Internally, Kim is telling the people to brace yourselves for a long period of economic difficulties and hard work to improve the economy, similar to the ‘Arduous March’ in the 1990s,” said Lee. “Externally, he is sending the message that he will not lower the bar for negotiations with the US just to have the sanctions removed, that he views improvement of U.S.-North Korea relations as a long-term issue and he will be braced for it accordingly.”

Lee’s theory could have a Chinese angle as well, since China is very determined to counter and delegitimize the use of sanctions to control rogue nations or enforce Western notions of human rights. Kim has every reason to believe Beijing will help him prop up his faltering economy and resist ongoing U.S. sanctions pressure.",1
299,"Reports: Americans, Foreigners on China’s Secret Watch Lists","Australian cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0 obtained what it claimed to be an official Chinese government “watch list” of American and other foreign nationals, the New York Post reported Thursday.

The secret “watch list” created by the Chinese regime included names, birth dates, and passport numbers of Americans and other foreigners who passed through Pudong International Airport in Shanghai between 2018 and 2020. The Shanghai list was the latest in a series of surveillance databases secretly compiled on foreign citizens by the Chinese government.

One of the names on the list is Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas, a popular American singer who performs under her first name as Ashanti. Others include at least one employee of the U.S. State Department, researchers, university professors, corporate executives, and tourists. Some of the names belonged to children as young as nine.

The purpose of the list, and the reasons why China added these 697 U.S. citizens to it, were unclear. The database also reportedly included 161 Australians and over 100 British nationals. A clue to its purpose could be an additional section that listed thousands of Uyghur Muslims who had evidently been flagged for surveillance or questioning as possible “terrorists.”

Also included with the leaked data was video from “dozens of cameras set up around Shanghai’s harbor, some with facial recognition and license plate readers tracking cars and people, according to the security experts,” according to the NYP.

The Chinese surveillance state includes extensive facial recognition capabilities, including systems that can identify members of targeted ethnic groups like the Uyghurs in crowds.

The database from Shanghai was obtained by Australian cybersecurity firm Internet 2.0, which passed it along to the NYP. In December 2020, Internet 2.0 helped to expose a network of Chinese Communist Party members from Shanghai working at British consulates and defense firms, using a database leaked by Chinese dissidents.

Internet 2.0’s two CEOs, Robert Potter and David Robinson, said the newly uncovered Shanghai watch list “gives us insight into the ambitions of China to collect what it can, to impose its will within its jurisdiction and to violate norms of privacy and accountability.”

“China blurs the boundaries between law and order, counter-terrorism and political crimes. Within this system there is limited restraint as all are collected on,” said a statement released by the company.

Security analysts warn China is aggressively building up its surveillance system and pouring new data into test systems and prototype networks, free of any concerns about privacy rights or legal restraint. Prudent travelers should assume they are under constant observation and could be either randomly flagged for closer scrutiny, or possibly tagged by facial recognition software the Chinese regime uses to monitor certain ethnic groups.

Shanghai has been ranked behind only two other Chinese cities, Chongqing and Shenzhen, as the most intensively monitored metropolis in the world. In September 2020, a database similar to the one obtained by Internet 2.0 — but with much more extensive information, some of it confidential — was uncovered in Shenzhen. This database heavily targeted Australians, a nation under sustained economic and political attack from Beijing because it demanded a thorough and independent investigation of the origins of the coronavirus.",1
300,"Delhi, India, Outlaws Driving Alone Without a Mask","It is illegal to drive in Delhi, India, without a mask during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic even if the driver is alone in his or her personal vehicle, the Delhi High Court ruled Wednesday.

“A vehicle which is moving across the city, even if occupied at a given point in time by one person, would be a public place owing to the immediate risk of exposure to other persons under varying circumstances,” the single-judge bench of Justice Prathiba M. Singh said on April 7.

Justice Singh ruled:

Thus, a vehicle even if occupied by only one person would constitute a “public place” and wearing of a mask therein would be compulsory. The wearing of a mask or a face cover in a vehicle, which may be occupied by either a single person or multiple persons is thus held to be compulsory in the context of the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic.

The Delhi High Court pronounced the verdict while dismissing four petitions challenging the Delhi government’s collection of fines from people found driving alone in their personal vehicles without a mask in recent months.

India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare told the Delhi High Court on Wednesday it “had not issued any direction asking people to wear masks in a car when they are alone. It had further said that health was a state subject and the Delhi government had to take a decision on the question,” the Indian legal news site Live Law reported.

Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is both a city and federal territory of India. It contains India’s national capital, New Delhi.

“The Delhi government had told the court that wearing masks while driving an official or personal vehicle was made compulsory by way of an office order in April last year and it remained in force,” according to Live Law.

Delhi’s government further told the court that a personal vehicle is not a private space, citing a previous ruling by the Indian Supreme Court to assert its position.

India’s Supreme Court ruled in July 2019 that a private car traveling on a public road in India may be deemed a “public place.”

“The court has essentially overruled a 1999 Kerala High Court judgment which had said that a private car on a public road would still constitute a private space,” Indian newspaper the Print reported at the time.

“The verdict can be interpreted to mean that any activity that is not allowed in a public space, such as smoking, will now not be allowed in a private car on a public road either,” the Print noted, predicting that the ruling would have “far-reaching consequences.”",1
301,Pompeo: No American Should Participate in the 2022 'Genocide Olympics',"Former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo urged Americans to boycott the 2022 Winter Olympics to be held in Beijing, China, calling them the “Genocide Olympics,” for the Chinese Communist Party’s treatment of minority Muslim Uyghurs in the country and its repression of free speech.

“I don’t think we should have any American go and participate in the Genocide Olympics,” he said Tuesday during the inaugural session of the Richard Nixon Foundation’s Nixon Seminar that he co-chaired with former National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien.

He also cited the risks to American athletes who may run afoul of Chinese laws and end up in jail. “How you would send your child there to compete when if they said so much as, ‘Boy, is the food is bad here,’ you can end up in a Chinese prison for an awfully long time?”

Pompeo quipped, “I hope we’ll convince the [International Olympics Committee] not to hold them there and find another solution. We figured out how to move an All-Star game pretty quickly. Maybe we can figure out how to move the Olympics.”

The State Department this week backed away from a suggestion that U.S. officials could boycott the games.

Tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who was a guest at the seminar, predicted that Western leaders would refrain from going, even without a boycott.

“Maybe our athletes will go. I don’t think you’re going to have many political leaders from the Western world,” he said. “And it will, you know, like maybe it’s not a full boycott like the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. But I think it will be anti-climactic. It will be, the turnout, the validation for China will be, you know, it will be as bad as Sochi in 2014. That’s even with no boycott at all.”

O’Brien predicted that corporate America would support the Olympics, however, despite criticizing voter ID laws passed in Georgia.

“It’s amazing how quickly the corporate America can justify a move from Atlanta to Denver. But it’s perfectly prepared to continue to support events in China. So it’s an area of real concern,” he said.

He also said during his time as the former hostage envoy in the Trump administration, he saw China’s behavior worsen on detaining foreign nationals similar to Iran.

“I think anyone has to be very concerned and has to think twice about why you’re going to China, what you’re going to do there. If you want to take the risk of having an extended stay as a guest of Mr. Xi Jinping,” he said.

302,Russia Says It Is in Talks to Produce ‘Additional’ Military Equipment in India,"New Delhi agreed to produce “additional” Russian military equipment in India during a Tuesday meeting between Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi.

“We confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation,” Lavrov told reporters after the meeting.

“We also discussed prospective and additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment in India within the concept ‘Made in India,'” Russia’s top diplomat said, referring to a New Delhi campaign promoting domestic manufacturing.

“We have discussed the prospects for defense cooperation, including the joint production of advanced weapons in India,” Lavrov told reporters from Russia’s state-run TASS news agency on April 6.

Though neither minister on Tuesday revealed what types of Russian military equipment India might produce, New Delhi agreed to manufacture 200 Russian-designed Kamov Ka 226T helicopters for India’s army and air force in December 2015. The Indo-Russian helicopter deal has been in the works for the past few years and was progressing toward a “formal go-ahead” as recently as February 2020, with an expected “rollout” date of 2025, according to the Economic Times of India.

“The first batch of helicopters will come out of our production facility at Tumkur in [southwestern India’s] Karnataka [state] by 2025 if everything goes as per plan,” Indo-Russian Helicopters Ltd. CEO N. M. Srinath told the Press Trust of India in February 2020.

“The Kamov Ka-226T helicopter has 72 percent Russian components and 28 percent from various western countries,” Srinath said.

Indian military sources allegedly told India’s WION news site in August 2020 that Moscow and New Delhi had resolved to “fast-track” the Kamov chopper joint venture.

“The parties have resolved and will make all efforts to fast-track the launching of these projects,” the sources said.

“India will be able to receive some crucial helicopter technologies” with “integration of various helicopter systems being possible,” the sources added.

Russia’s foreign minister alluded to this possible information-sharing between New Delhi and Moscow on April 6 when discussing the two parties’ joint military cooperation.

“We are the only country that actually provides India with advanced defense technologies. We are confident that efforts to boost Russian-Indian defense cooperation are in line with the national interests of both countries,” Lavrov told TASS.

“India-Russia ties are characterized by consistent ability to identify and update shared interests,” Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar told reporters on Tuesday.

India plans to acquire five Russian S-400 surface-to-air missile systems under a 2018 agreement with Moscow. The U.S. has voiced opposition to the $5.5 million venture and threatened New Delhi with sanctions if it follows through with the agreement as part of its campaign to discourage foreign countries from inking defense deals with Moscow. India says it needs the Russian anti-aircraft weapons systems to counter an ongoing threat from its belligerent neighbor, China, with which it remains engaged in a nearly year-long border standoff in the Himalayas.",1
303,Chinese Censors Blur Western Brand Logos on TV Programs,"Chinese television shows have recently begun blurring the logos of Western retail brands when they happen to appear on TV stars’ clothing items, the BBC reported on Wednesday.

Recent episodes of the popular Chinese variety show Sisters Who Make Waves “now feature singers and actors who look like they are floating on clouds, thanks to their blurred-out shoes,” according to the BBC. The Chinese reality show Chuang 2021 recently featured some of its stars blurred from their shoulders down to their ankles, as they had worn both Western-branded shirts and pants.

The reality TV contest program Youth With You provided post-production editors with an especially tedious task last month after at least 50 of the show’s contestants wore T-shirts bearing Western logos.

“The production company behind the show, iQiyi, had issued a notice on 25 March saying that an upcoming episode had to be delayed, but did not give a reason,” the BBC reported. “Two days later, however, viewers immediately spotted that brand logos had been blurred on the t-shirts of more than 50 people.”

The United States, Britain, the European Union, and Canada jointly imposed sanctions on Chinese government officials on March 22 over their alleged human rights abuses in the Chinese territory of Xinjiang, which include forcing ethnic Uyghurs – a Sunni Muslim Turkic group – and other regional minorities to harvest cotton under slave labor conditions. Xinjiang serves as a Chinese frontier region along the country’s border with Central Asia.

China responded to the March 22 joint sanctions by imposing retaliatory sanctions on British government officials and institutions on March 26. Several foreign retailers that use Xinjiang cotton reacted to news of the sanctions by denouncing the region’s alleged slave labor conditions. The public outcry against Xinjiang cotton elicited additional responses by China’s ruling Communist Party on March 26, when party officials launched a targeted attack of foreign brands critical of Uyghur slave labor.

The Swedish fast-fashion giant H&M, which announced it would stop buying Xinjiang cotton in 2020, was among the first Western brands targeted by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the aftermath of the March 22 sanctions. CCP officials practically erased H&M from China’s already heavily censored internet starting March 26.

In the nearly two weeks since then, additional Western clothing retailers have had their online shops blocked by CCP internet censors.

“Some of the brands embroiled in the controversy include Nike, Adidas, and Puma – all members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI), a non-profit group promoting sustainable cotton production,” the BBC reported on April 7. “The group said in October it had suspended activities in Xinjiang as well as licensing of the region’s cotton, citing allegations and ‘increasing risks’ of forced labor.”",1
304,China Claims Tourism in Wuhan Booming a Year After Lockdown,"China’s state-run Global Times on Tuesday proclaimed tourism to Wuhan, ground zero for the global coronavirus pandemic, has “rebounded” in the year since heavy lockdown orders were lifted and the city is now witnessing a “travel blowout.”

“The just-passed three-day Qingming Festival holiday saw the city rank among the top 10 domestic tourist destinations, a scene few would have imagined a year ago,” the Global Times reported, rhapsodizing about the cherry blossoms, lake views, architectural landmarks, and local cuisine. Wuhan’s food became famous around the world last year for very different reasons.

According to the report, tourism in Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province reached about 60 percent of its 2019 peak. Tourism and travel workers said their income from the Qingming holiday was nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. The once-desolate city of Wuhan teemed with hundreds of thousands of visitors — crowds so huge and tightly packed that “people could hardly move,” according to a traffic officer.

The Qingming Festival is, perhaps appropriately, China’s annual holiday to honor the dead. It is also known as the Tomb-Sweeping Festival. The ancient legend behind the festival includes a dash of cannibalism.

Another Global Times report Tuesday said domestic travel across all of China would “likely surpass the level of 2019” during the May Day season, marking a “full-fledged recovery” for the tourism industry. However, tourism income was expected to take a 30- to 40-percent hit because “consumer spending remains relatively sluggish” and inflation is running high.

Industry analysts estimated tourism rebounded to 94.5 percent of 2019 levels across China during the Qingming Festival, which ran from Saturday to Monday. Tourism income, as projected, did not recover as much. Total revenues were estimated at $4.15 billion, which is roughly 57 percent of 2019’s take. One expert suggested China’s ongoing restrictions on international travel pumped up domestic tourism, as vacationers had no choice but to visit domestic attractions.

“The figures shed light on the rapid recovery of the tourism market in the post-epidemic era and showed that in terms of trip numbers, the domestic travel market has almost entirely returned to normalcy, another milestone in China’s world-leading recovery from the pandemic,” the Global Times wrote.",1
305,"GOP Rep. Carter: Biden ‘Doing Irreparable Damage’ to Georgia, But Won’t Boycott Olympics in China","On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox Business Network’s “Cavuto: Coast to Coast,” Rep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) criticized President Joe Biden for “doing irreparable damage” to Georgia’s businesspeople and penalizing American states while refusing to call for a boycott of the 2022 Olympics in China.

Carter said Biden is “doing irreparable damage. Let me tell you, he just does not get it. He does not understand that these are people’s livelihoods here. I just want to take the opportunity to thank Joe Biden, to thank Stacey Abrams, and to thank Raphael Warnock for taking this away from the state of Georgia. You should be congratulated. And you have achieved what you set out to achieve, taking money out of the pockets of small businesspeople, many of them minority businesspeople. You should be ashamed of what you’ve done here. And the president of the United States, who sits back and does nothing with Communist China when they are violating human rights over there, but you ask him about Beijing and the 2022 Olympics, no comment whatsoever. Yet, he wants to penalize his own states? That is irresponsible, and it’s just despicable.”

306,China Takes Lead in Pressuring Biden to Remove Sanctions on Iran,"Iranian state media on Wednesday praised Iran’s 25-year, $400 billion cooperation agreement with China as a “geopolitical game-changer” that positioned Beijing as leader of the effort to drag the United States back into the nuclear deal, even as Iran violates the deal in increasingly brazen ways.

Iran’s PressTV quoted “American-Chinese social media activist” Carl Zha scoffing at American media for getting “worked up” about the deal, conservatives portraying it as a failure of the Biden administration’s foreign policy, China hawks worried about a new Axis of Evil taking shape, and Iranian dissidents who see the deal as “somehow Iran selling out to China.”

Zha could not think of any rational reason why any of Iran or China’s critics would be apprehensive about the deal, instead, chalking it up to irrational anti-Iranian and anti-Chinese animus and “U.S. policymakers” worried about losing “the position of the U.S. as a hegemon in the world” to China.

He then laid out how China is now positioned to shield the malevolent Iranian regime from consequences for its human rights abuses and dangerous pursuit of nuclear weapons:

China and Iran Cooperation goes a long way. I mean not just, just, historically, but also in the modern time, you know China has always dealt with Iran and in the latest round of sanctions the US placed on Iran, China continue to do business (with Iran) despite the US sanctions because, you know, the, the US sanctions rely on the premise that the US has dominate the global finance right and because US threatened to sanction, any company, any government that has dealing with Iran, but China is in a position today where you can basically ignore the US sanction and continue to, to work on its traditional relationship, normal relationship, with Iran. And I think that is what has upset people in Washington, because they see the US is losing its grip.

Zha added that Iran and China’s other Belt and Road partners are hoping to “bypass the U.S. Navy’s chokehold on the world shipping trade,” which is thinly-disguised code for Iran and China gaining the ability to threaten global shipping and shut down the oil trade. China constantly complains about U.S. Navy Freedom of Navigation operations through waters Beijing illegally claims to control, while Iran constantly threatens to attack shipping in the Persian Gulf – and sometimes follows through on those threats.

China dove into the argument over the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), on Tuesday by describing the United States as the “offending party” and demanding it make the first move by unilaterally lifting all sanctions against the regime in Tehran.

“The justified request of the injured party, rather than the offending party, should be confirmed and satisfied first. This is a basic right-or-wrong question. The U.S. should lift all sanctions against Tehran and on this basis, Iran can resume full compliance to the nuclear deal,” declared Chinese envoy to the United Nations Wang Qun after meeting with representatives from Iran and the European signatories to the JCPOA.

“The U.S. should return to the deal unconditionally, and lift all illegal sanctions against Iran and long-arm jurisdiction over a third party,” demanded Cheng Hua, China’s ambassador to Iran.

Europeans, and the Biden State Department, largely ignored these demands and blandly praised the Vienna meeting as “constructive.” The Biden State Department was not invited to the Vienna meeting and has had no known interactions with the Iranian regime.

European representatives pushed for the formation of two “working groups” that would handle U.S. sanctions and Iran’s flagrant violations of the JCPOA as separate issues. A senior Iranian official told PressTV his government would flatly refuse that approach – with China’s heavyweight support, Tehran demands complete and unilateral elimination of all U.S. sanctions before it will consider slowing its rush to nuclear weapons.

“From Iran’s viewpoint, all American sanctions – including the Obama-era sanctions, the sanctions restored by Trump, and the additional sanctions in the Trump-era labeled as non-nuclear – must be terminated,” the official said. “Iran’s condition for returning to its JCPOA commitments is the lasting removal of all the entire sanctions.”

Iran continued merrily enriching uranium far beyond any plausible need, and far beyond the limits set by the JCPOA, even as Tehran and China demanded unconditional American submission.

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) reported on Wednesday that Iran has now stockpiled 55 kilograms of uranium enriched to 20 percent, demonstrating an even greater capacity for enrichment than Iran possessed before the nuclear deal, which should be a rather embarrassing revelation for defenders of the JCPOA.

According to the AEOI, the new advanced centrifuges Iran isn’t supposed to be spinning, at the Fordow site it’s not supposed to be using, have helped it to enrich at least 40 percent more uranium than the regime commanded in January. Experts consider 20 percent enrichment the last practical step before reaching weapons-grade production.

There is little doubt that President Joe Biden desperately wants to return to the JCPOA, reaping praise from left-wing media for correcting his predecessor Donald Trump’s “mistake” in withdrawing from it, but Iran’s flagrant violations and China’s demands for abject submission are making the job more difficult than Biden expected.

A group of over 300 Iranian-American activists on Wednesday wrote a letter to Biden urging him to make human rights reforms in Iran a condition of lifting sanctions – a demand Tehran and its patrons in Beijing will reject out of hand, especially since the Chinese are making a very big deal about resisting America’s use of sanctions to impose its supposedly narrow vision of human rights on other nations.",1
307,Tufts U. to Shut Down Confucius Institute After Student Protests,"Tufts University in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, has announced that it will shut down its Confucius Institute in the wake of student protests. The university, however, said it is ending the Confucius Institute to “focus more on our strong and growing direct relationship” with Beijing Normal University. Student protesters attacked the school’s “shameful collaboration between the university administration and the Chinese Communist Party.”

“In 2015, Tufts University launched the Confucius Institute at Tufts University (CITU), a program within the School of Arts and Sciences, to provide support for supplemental, not-for-credit Chinese language and culture instruction and programming, and to facilitate educational and cultural exchange and cooperation between Tufts and Beijing Normal University (BNU),” Tufts said in its announcement.

While the university paints its Confucius Institute in a positive light, U.S. lawmakers increasingly characterize the institutes as outposts for Chinese government propaganda.

Moreover, under the Trump administration, the Confucius Institute U.S. Center was designated as a foreign mission, and being a part of the Chinese Communist Party’s propaganda machine.

Tufts University went on to say that while the school announced a two-year renewal of the CITU in 2019, it will now allow that agreement to expire in September, so that the university can focus on “expanding and deepening” its “strong and growing direct relationship with BNU.”

“The CITU has made a valuable contribution to Chinese language and culture learning at Tufts and helped to facilitate Tufts’ important relationship with BNU,” Tufts said. “We appreciate all who have supported and contributed to its operation. We are particularly grateful to BNU, our partner in China, for its support for and role in developing the CITU’s programming from 2015 to 2021.”

The university continued:

The decision to move on from the CITU will enable the university to focus on expanding and deepening its relationship with BNU, whose College of Chinese Language and Culture is regarded as a leading center for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. Tufts already has established successful programs with BNU, including the “Tufts in Beijing” study abroad program and, over the past year, an in-person learning option for Tufts students in China, the “Tufts@BNU” program. Our successful and collaborative experience has affirmed our interest in growing our relationship with BNU and exploring potential additional options for both virtual and in-person exchange in Chinese language, culture and other areas.

While the university did not acknowledge its students’ concerns in its announcement, students previously held protests demanding the school shut down its Confucius Institute, which they referred to as a “shameful collaboration between the university administration and the Chinese Communist Party.”

“In solidarity with Uyghurs, Hongkongers, Tibetans, and all peoples who have suffered at the hands of the CCP, we will protest each Saturday until our voices are hear,” the student said in an Instagram post.

Another Instagram caption read:

“The Confucius Institute wants less people to know what [China is] actually doing in Hong Kong, Uyghur and Taiwan in today’s culture. They are basically trying to do the same thing that they did to the Tibetans. I attend these protest to show that even the younger generation can get involved because it is for the better of our future. As an Asian American or better yet a Tibetan American born in America, it’s harder for me to know about the past, so when I go to these events, I learned so much more and it makes me understand why it is so important to be proud of my own culture. To have the knowledge of what has happened to others and what is happening now is very important to me.” -Tendol, 17

In another Instagram post, an apparent Tibetan-American student wrote, “When the CCP is literally at Tufts University after my family fled Tibet.”

“We showed up to [Tufts University President Anthony Monaco]’s doorsteps and sent a very clear message,” the students said in another Instagram caption, which included an image of a sign, which read, “Confucius Institute = Chinese Communist Party’s Soft Power.”

Weekly protests at Tufts University were jointly organized by Students for a Free Tibet Boston, the Tibetan Association of Boston, the Boston Uyghur Association, Hong Kong Social Action Movements Boston, and the Formosan Association for Public Affairs MA, according to Students for a Free Tibet.

An increasing number of universities across the country have shut down their Confucius Institutes in recent years.

Last year, the University of Missouri (Mizzou) announced it was closing its Confucius Institute after the U.S. Department of State notified the school that it is no longer allowed to have Chinese instructors teaching Mandarin without the supervision of a Chinese-speaking American.

The year prior, the University of Delaware announced its plan to end its ten-year partnership with the Confucius Institute. And in 2018, Texas A&M University terminated its agreement to host two Confucius Institutes.

308,Kim Jong-un Says North Korea Is in Its ‘Worst-Ever Situation’,"Kim Jong-un appeared to state North Korea is currently enduring the worst period of its history in a speech to members of his ruling Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) on Wednesday.

Kim did not elaborate on what he was referring to when he said North Korea was in its “worst-ever” situation and, other than urging party leaders to address unspecified “shortcomings,” spoke much more optimistically than in other recent public statements, most notably in a tearful apology speech to the Korean people in October. The context of his remark was urging local Workers’ Party leaders to improve “people’s living standards,” suggesting that the situation which he lamented as historically poor was the nation’s economic one.

North Korea is currently under a strict sanctions regime imposed by the U.N. Security Council in 2017, following the nation’s latest illegal nuclear weapons test. Then-President Donald Trump convinced the Council — which includes North Korea’s closest ally, China — to impose the sanctions despite China and other members having veto power. While reports indicate China has regularly violated the sanctions, North Korea’s Chinese coronavirus lockdown appears to have kept much of China’s trade with the country on the other side of the border in 2020.

The speech followed Pyongyang announcing Tuesday that it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, citing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic and a desire to protect its athletes from infection. North Korea currently claims to have documented zero cases of coronavirus in the country despite bordering some of the most severely affected states in the world, including China, where the pandemic originated.

In addition to the withdrawal from the athletic event, North Korea has sent other signals suggesting its claim of not having any documented coronavirus cases is masking a significant health crisis, including the abrupt announcement of the construction of a new hospital in Pyongyang, rolling lockdowns nationwide, the closure of its financially important border with China, and North Korea’s participation in Covax, the World Health Organization (W.H.O.)’s program to help poorer nations access coronavirus vaccines.

“Really heavy are the duties you have assumed in this pivotal period, an important phase in the strengthening of our Party and the development of our revolution,” Kim told cell secretaries of his communist party during remarks on Wednesday, according to Pyongyang’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). He urged party members to choose policies “at advancing our style of the socialist cause on a higher stage by achieving a tangible change and development in the economic work.” The economic work, he continued, required “improving the people’s living standards and in all other fields even in the worst-ever situation.”

“Although some successes have been achieved in the work of strengthening the Party cells and increasing their role since the Fifth Conference of the Cell Chairpersons of the Workers’ Party of Korea, there are quite a few shortcomings as well,” Kim acknowledged. “To immediately correct the shortcomings latent in the work of Party cells is an inevitable process that should be followed by our Party for its healthy and sustainable development; and only then can our Party creditably carry out its mission as the militant General Staff that leads the revolution and construction with its roots struck deep among the masses of the people. Even though the shortcomings may be partial and small, they should never be neglected.”

Despite addressing these unspecified “shortcomings,” Kim said he was “fully convinced that this conference will mark a significant occasion” and encouraged attendees by claiming, “the whole country is in a remarkably high spirit in the efforts for implementing the decisions adopted at the Eighth Congress of the WPK and the Second Plenary Meeting of its Eighth Central Committee,” which occurred at the beginning of the year.

Kim’s remarks at the opening of that Eighth Party Congress in January similarly described North Korea as going through “worst-ever trials” in its history, without quite specifying what challenges Kim estimated to be worse than anything since his grandfather founded the country in 1945.

“In this period the unprecedented, worst-ever trials put great obstacles on the road of advance of our revolution, but our Party achieved great successes through tenacious and accurate practical activities aimed at implementing its fighting programmes,” Kim said at the time. “During the period under review our internal force further expanded and strengthened, and the external prestige of the country was raised remarkably.”

In the same speech, Kim stated North Korea had failed its five-year plan in “almost all sectors” and needed to reconfigure its goals. Those remarks appeared to be a continuation of his apologetic remarks in October about his government’s failure to build a stable economy under communism.

“Our people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily. I am really sorry for that,” Kim said at the time during a televised speech that showed him crying as he apologized. “Although I am entrusted with the important responsibility to lead this country upholding the cause of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il thanks to the trust of all the people, my efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life.”

Many observers last year suggested that Kim was making veiled references to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the country, which his regime has consistently affirmed has not affected a single person. Pyongyang has belied significant concern over the pandemic in the past week, first by withdrawing from the Olympics, then by once again announcing a new public health program and demanding the W.H.O. take bigger actions against the pandemic.

“The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has decided not to participate in the 32nd Olympic Games during the general assembly to protect our athletes from the global health crisis situation related to the coronavirus as proposed by committee members,” a statement from the North Korean government published Tuesday read. Despite Pyongyang regularly insulting the Olympics host nation, Japan, and typically using its media platforms to accuse the Japanese of rampant human rights abuses, it did not appear to link its withdrawal from the Olympics to the fact that Tokyo will be hosting.

Minju Joson, a North Korean state newspaper, urged the W.H.O. on Wednesday to take a more authoritative role in combatting the pandemic.

“As the [Chinese coronavirus] swept across the world recently, a number of lives were lost and it has had a serious negative impact on the development of our society and economy,” the newspaper asserted. “We will strengthen cooperation with W.H.O. and actively push ahead with projects to improve public health.”

Minju Joson did not specify exactly how North Korea would “strengthen cooperation” on the matter or why it would have to, given that it has documented no cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began.

309,China Warns Washington Not to Boycott Winter Olympics,"BEIJING (AP) — China’s government warned Washington on Wednesday not to boycott next year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing after the Biden administration said it was talking with allies about a joint approach to complaints of human rights abuses.

A Foreign Ministry spokesperson rejected accusations of abuses against ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region. He warned of an unspecified “robust Chinese response” to a potential Olympics boycott.

“The politicization of sports will damage the spirit of the Olympic Charter and the interests of athletes from all countries,” said the spokesperson, Zhao Lijian. “The international community including the U.S. Olympic Committee will not accept it.”

Human rights groups are protesting China’s hosting of the games, due to start in February 2022. They have urged a boycott or other measures to call attention to accusations of Chinese abuses against Uyghurs, Tibetans and residents of Hong Kong.

The U.S. State Department suggested an Olympic boycott was among the possibilities but a senior official said later a boycott has not been discussed. The International Olympic Committee and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee have said in the past they oppose boycotts.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that the White House is not looking at a boycott of the 2022 Olympics.

“We have not discussed, and are not discussing, any joint boycott with allies and partners,” she said.

When asked if the U.S. government would discourage Americans from traveling to China, Psaki said the Biden administration hopes that by the time of the event, “we are at a point where enough people across the country, and hopefully around the world have been vaccinated” against COVID-19.",1
310,China Compares Uyghur Genocide to Alleged ‘White Mobs’ Attacking American Muslims,"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian defended his regime’s ongoing genocide of the Uyghur Muslim people on Wednesday by claiming that roving “white mobs” terrorized Muslim communities in America in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

Zhao (pictured) claimed America also has a history of “genocide” and “horrific systemic ethnic cleansing and slaughter” against Native Americans.

Extensive evidence, including eyewitness testimony and satellite imaging, shows that the Chinese Communist Party has imprisoned as many as 3 million ethnic Uyghurs, as well as other Muslim minority members like Kazakhs and Kyrgyz people, in a network of over 1,000 concentration camps throughout Xinjiang, China’s largest and westernmost province. Survivors say guards at the camps submit prisoners to indoctrination, torture, “nightly” rape, and medical testing consistent with live organ harvesting. Outside of the camps, China has demolished thousands of mosques, installed a sophisticated surveillance system, and enslaved hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in its cotton fields.

Zhao Lijian rose to prominence in his role as a Chinese government mouthpiece for accusing the American government, without evidence, of unleashing the Chinese coronavirus pandemic on the world through the U.S. Army. The Chinese government has yet to publish any evidence supporting the conspiracy theory; all evidence collected presently indicates the pandemic originated in Hubei province, China, in late 2019.

Both the administrations of Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden have described the campaign against the Uyghur people as a “genocide.” State Department spokesman Ned Price again used the word regarding the Chinese government’s behavior there on Tuesday, prompting a question of Zhao soliciting a response.

“As we’ve said repeatedly, the so-called allegation of ‘genocide’ in Xinjiang is the most preposterous lie of the century,” Zhao asserted. “The more diligently the U.S. works to fabricate lies on China’s human rights conditions and disguise itself as human rights defender, the more it exposes its guilty conscience burdened by its grave human rights problems at home.”

“US history has recorded the horrific systemic ethnic cleansing and slaughter of native Indians, which constitute genocide and crimes against humanity,” Zhao continued, later referring to American racism as “comprehensive, systematic and persistent” and equating sanctions on repressive regimes with the allegations of genocide against China.

Zhao later claimed that Muslims in China – subject to imprisonment in concentration camps, forced sterilization, disappearances, torture, slavery, and killing – live more freely than Muslims in America.

“After 9/11, some American cities witnessed radical behaviors including smashing and looting of mosques in Muslim communities. The Muslim group were [sic] targeted by white mobs,” Zhao claimed. The spokesman did not name a single incident of “white mobs” attacking Muslims or any American city where this occurred.

“A U.S. poll showed that over 80 percent of those surveyed believe Muslims face discrimination in the U.S.,” Zhao added, without citing a polling firm or research institute.

After the September 11 attacks, the FBI did document an increase in the number of incidents against Muslim people in the country, though these were individual crimes and the evidence did not indicate what percentage of the crimes were attributable to white Americans, much less “white mobs.” Pivotally, these attacks were prosecuted and not part of a state-sponsored campaign against Muslims like the one China is currently implementing in Xinjiang. One of President George W. Bush’s first public appearances following the Al Qaeda attacks in 2001 was to the mosque at the Islamic Center of Washington, where he urged peace and understanding for American Muslims.

“The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,” Bush said at the event. “Islam is peace.”

In contrast, China has effectively outlawed the practice of Islam outside of the control of the state. Under dictator Xi Jinping, the Chinese communist regime has launched a campaign to “sinicize,” or make more “Chinese,” all five legal religions in the country: Islam, Christianity, Catholicism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The campaign requires mosques to display large banners praising Xi and imams to heavily promote communist propaganda. Many banners replace key Islamic iconography such as inscriptions of the shahada, or Islamic profession of faith: “there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is his prophet.”

While some mosques remain intact in Xinjiang behind the red banners, tens of thousands have disappeared. In a report published in September, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) revealed it had documented the destruction of 16,000 Uyghur mosques since 2017. The Chinese government replaced some of these mosques with features apparently meant as insults to Muslims, such as public toilets.

Zhao has made his claims of out-of-control racism in the United States a staple of his daily briefings. On Tuesday, he told reporters, “in the U.S., racism is a systemic and persistent existence covering every aspect.”

“White supremacists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members openly used racist slogans to preach white supremacy, incite racial discrimination and hatred. U.S. history has recorded the horrific systemic ethnic cleansing and slaughter of Native Indians, which constitute genocide and crimes against humanity,” Zhao claimed. “U.S. law enforcement brutality has led frequently to death of African Americans. In the workplace, racism is a deep-seated problem. Discrimination against ethnic minorities is a prevalent presence across the whole society.”

311,Myanmar Protesters Set Another Chinese-Owned Factory on Fire,"Security forces loyal to the Myanmar junta opened fire in several locations Wednesday, killing 13 protesters. The incident resulted in the burning of a Chinese-owned factory in the city of Yangon.

Coup leader Gen. Min Aung Hlaing blamed the protesters for all of the violence and destruction, accusing them of “destroying” the country.

“Although protests are staged in neighboring countries and the international community, they do not destroy businesses. CDM is an activity to destroy the country,” the general said Wednesday, striving to make Myanmar’s pro-democracy activists look more dangerous and illegitimate than comparable movements in other nations.

CDM stands for Civil Disobedience Movement, the blanket term that has become common for the Myanmar protesters, who demand the restoration of civilian rule under the country’s elected leadership.

The civilian government of Aung San Suu Kyi was overthrown on February 1. The junta arrested Suu Kyi and charged her with corruption. Her supporters, and many Burmese legal experts, say the charges against her were fabricated and the military’s actions violate the national constitution.

Many of the protesters believe, with good reason, that China supports the junta and is willing to do business with its leaders, so there have been several attacks on Chinese-owned factories. Another evidently occurred Wednesday at the JOC Garment factory in Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city and commercial hub. No casualties were reported, and there have been no official statements on the extent of the damage.

Witnesses heard a series of seven small explosions in Yangon on Wednesday. The U.S. Embassy heard reports that these were “sound bombs,” essentially fireworks meant to make noise rather than cause significant damage. There were also reports of protesters in Yangon burning Chinese flags.

China’s state-run Global Times declared the JOC Garment factory fire was “likely the work of arson as tools were found on the site” and said Burmese police were reviewing security camera footage to hunt for suspects. The “arson tools” were not described in detail.

The owner of the factory told the Global Times that the fire burned for about an hour on the first floor of the building, destroying “finished and semi-finished products, as well as machines.”

Myanmar’s special envoy to the United Nations, an opponent of the coup known simply as Dr. Sasa, said Wednesday that his country could be heading toward “genocide.” The U.N. envoy to Myanmar, Christine Shraner Burgener, warns that “a bloodbath is imminent” as the protests and junta crackdown threaten to escalate into civil war on “an unprecedented scale.”

The Washington Post agreed Wednesday that civil war is a real possibility, especially as the increasingly frustrated junta has been unable to shut down protests by shutting down the Internet. Not only have the protesters found analog methods of organizing with paper and word of mouth, but they are even developing a “pop-up economy” to work around the junta’s control over the economy.

The Internet shutdown has cost Myanmar a billion dollars so far, and the junta appears much more willing to pay that price than the public. The U.N. warns of growing food insecurity as the prices of food and fuel skyrocket.

As analysts told the Washington Post, the junta is very unlikely to give up power, scale back its repressive tactics, or make any concessions to the protest movement. Demonstrators tired of getting shot in the streets are reportedly arming themselves, forging alliances with ethnic militia groups, and receiving paramilitary training in border camps.

“Increasing levels of violence are hardening opposition and broadening a popular consensus that a return to military rule must be prevented at all costs. The banking system is hardly functioning, transport and logistics are crippled, and ports paralyzed, sending the country spiralling into economic crisis,” warned the International Crisis Group.

Nikkei Asia on Wednesday suggested the junta has underestimated the generational shift in Myanmar, as younger people filling the ranks of the protest movement are more tuned into international news and have studied protests like the ones in Hong Kong.

Some of these younger people have little memory of Myanmar’s decades under military rule, having grown up under the civilian government instituted in 2011, so they were shocked and horrified to see their elected government overthrown by military leaders.

Young residents who spoke to Nikkei Asia said they had given their military considerable benefit of the doubt before the coup, but now they are more willing to believe reports of atrocities such as the ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya Muslims and more inclined to hold top military officers accountable for brutality. As Nikkei Asia pointed out, most young and educated Burmese live in big cities in the geographical center of the country, so until now they have largely taken the army’s word for what happens in the hinterlands and border regions — a trust destroyed by the coup.",1
312,Trade Deficit Widened to Record $71.1 Billion in Biden’s First Full Month,"The U.S.’s trade deficit widened 4.8 percent to a record $71.1 billion in February, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.

Economists had forecast a trade gap of $70.4 billion. The January gap was revised down from $68.2 billion to $67.8 billion.

Both imports and exports fell in the month but the pace of the decline of exports was much swifter, enlarging the deficit. Imports fell seven-tenths of a percentage point but remain near record highs. Exports fell 2.6 percent.

The trade in goods deficit rose by $2.8 billion to $88 billion. The services surplus shrank $500,000 million to $16.9 billion.

U.S. exports have been hurt by the return off lockdowns and slumping economies across the globe, particularly in Europe. American spending has been bolstered by the strength of the U.S. economy, enhanced unemployment benefits, and stimulus payments—and a large portion of that spending is leaking out to foreign producers through imports.

The record-high trade deficit means a large share of income earned by Americans is being converted to the incomes of foreigners. That reduces the incomes of U.S. households and subtracts from gross domestic product.

The record-high trade deficits are expected to continue for the near term as the U.S. economy continues to grow faster than the economies of our trading partners. Economists predict that the U.S. economy will grow by 6 percent or more this year.

Year-to-date, the goods and services deficit is up $56.5 billion, or 68.6 percent, from the same period in 2020. On a year-to-date basis, exports decreased $36.2 billion or 8.7 percent. Imports increased $20.3 billion or 4.1 percent. The comparisons to last year include the beginning of the pandemic, which weighed heavily on international trade.

Imports of motor vehicles and parts fell $3.4 billion, including a $1.8 billion decline in passenger cars. Production of autos has been hurt around the world due to a shortage of semiconductors. Exports of vehicles and parts fell by $700,000 million.

Imports of consumer goods decreased by $2.7 billion. Exports of consumer goods fell by $9oo million.

Imports of industrial supplies and materials increased by $3.5 billion. Imports of oil rose by $1 billion.

The deficit with China increased by $3.1 billion to $30.3 billion in February. Exports decreased by $4.5 billion to $10.4 billion and imports decreased by $1.5 billion to $40.6 billion.

Exports of U.S. services, which typically run in surplus and slightly offset the long-running deficit in goods, have fallen during the pandemic, in large part because of a decline in tourism. Travel services, for example, fell by $100 million in February.",1
313,Hong Kong Bar Owners Stage ‘Hunger Strike’ to Protest Virus Closures,"Bar owners in Hong Kong staged a symbolic hunger strike on Monday to protest the city government’s ongoing coronavirus restrictions, which have forced bars to remain closed while allowing other businesses, such as restaurants, to reopen.

“People are queueing for beaches … restaurants are full, but only we are in pain and barred from opening,” Leung Lap-yan, founding president of Hong Kong’s Licensed Bar and Club Association, told reporters on April 5. Leung gathered with other bar, karaoke, and mahjong (Chinese tile game) parlor owners on April 4 in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters to launch a four-day protest of continued bar closures. Participants will refuse meals in shifts as part of a symbolic hunger strike.

April 4 marked the one-year anniversary of the Hong Kong government’s first mandate ordering bars in the city to close due to the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Hong Kong bars have been fully closed for 230 days over the past year, “opened with restrictions for 101 days, and allowed to run normally for only 24 days,” Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported on Monday.

“The latest closures have been in place since November, meaning bar owners missed out on the usually peak Christmas, New Year, and Easter holiday seasons.”

The Hong Kong government said last April it had traced the city’s first cluster of coronavirus infections to bars and pubs and promptly issued a municipal mandate ordering the facilities to close.

“Any premises (commonly known as bar or pub) that is exclusively or mainly used for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquors … must be closed [sic],” the government said in a statement on April 2, 2020.

“Violators of the new measure face six months in jail and a fine of HK$50,000 ($6,450),” Reuters reported at the time.

The Hong Kong government has allowed restaurants in the city to reopen in recent weeks if they enforce capacity restrictions, which include seating no more than four people per table. Hong Kong shopping malls and theme parks have also recently reopened with AFP on Monday describing them as “packed.” Gyms, which have been repeatedly blamed by the Hong Kong government for new coronavirus clusters, have also been allowed to resume business.

Despite the sweeping reopenings, bars in Hong Kong remain closed. Bar owners at the hunger strike on Monday said their industry was “willing to adopt stringent measures including capacity restrictions and even requiring customers to drink with a straw.” Despite the bar owners’ concessions, the Hong Kong government has yet to issue any response, nor has it indicated that it will allow pubs to resume business anytime soon.",1
314,"Biden’s DHS Budget: More $$ for Migrants and Lawyers, No $$ for the Wall","President Joe Biden’s first budget for border security would discard unspent funds for the border wall and then spend extra money to legalize more migrants and launch more investigations of immigration enforcement officers.

The pro-migration budget request to Congress was announced Friday by the administration, which said it wants $52 billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from October 2021 to September 2022.

The request is short on details, but it asks Congress to take back money appropriated in prior years for the construction of the border wall:

The discretionary request includes no additional funding for border wall construction and proposes the cancellation of prior-year balances that are unobligated at the end of 2021.

Biden’s deputies have halted the border wall’s construction, even though many of the gaps used by migrants could be closed by the unspent money that Congress allocated in 2019 and 2020 to the construction of the border wall. More than $1 billion of allocated funds has not been obligated to contractors.

The Biden budget does not ask for extra funds to hire more agents to block and deport the current surge of roughly one million migrants seeking access to Americans’ jobs, wages, and schools.

But the Biden request does ask for extra money to ensure that more border agents and enforcement officers can face threatened or real investigation of claimed crimes:

This funding level also provides $470 million, an additional $84 million over the 2021 enacted level, for the Offices of Professional Responsibility at Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to ensure that DHS workforce complaints, including those related to white supremacy or ideological and non-ideological beliefs, are investigated expeditiously. … The discretionary request proposes increasing funding for the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to address the press of complaints the office has received, but has been unable to process because of staffing shortages.

The budget also wants funds to ensure DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) welcome and accelerate the inflow of migrants into Americans’ blue-collar jobs, housing markets, and K-12 schools:

Restores America’s Promise to Refugees. The discretionary request provides $4.3 billion to the [HHS] Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). This funding level would rebuild the Nation’s refugee resettlement infrastructure and support the resettling of up to 125,000 refugees in 2022, which would represent the highest number of refugees admitted to the United States in 30 years.

Many imported refugees are hired for low-wage jobs in retail stores and slaughterhouses, so reducing the need for companies to hire Americans at higher wages or to transfer profits into the purchase of labor-saving machines.

The budget seeks taxpayer funds to hire lawyers who can guide younger migrants through the thickets of American immigration law, past the immigration judges who would return them to their home countries, and into legal status:

The discretionary request for [HHS} ORR also reflects a commitment to ensuring unaccompanied immigrant children are unified with relatives and sponsors as safely and quickly as possible and to providing these children with care and services that align with child welfare best practices while they are in ORR’s custody. Such services would include expanded access to counsel [emphasis added] to help children navigate complex immigration court proceedings. In addition, the discretionary request redresses past wrongs by providing resources for critical supportive services—including trauma and mental health services—to children cruelly separated from their families under the previous administration.

DHS should also get more money to accelerate the movement of migrants into Americans’ jobs, according to the budget request:

The discretionary request provides $345 million for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services to address naturalization and asylum backlogs [of migrants seeking green cards], support up to 125,000 refugee admissions in 2022, and allow for systems and operations modernization. The discretionary request supports expanded access to the Alternatives to Detention program and provides enhanced case management services, particularly for families seeking asylum.

The Department of Justice would get money to hire pro-migration judges who will often stop deportation cases, and rubber-stamp requests for asylum and green cards:

In order to address the nearly 1.3 million outstanding cases before the immigration courts, the discretionary request makes an investment of $891 million, an increase of $157 million or 21 percent over the 2021 enacted level, in the Executive Office for Immigration Review. This funding supports 100 new immigration judges, including support personnel, as well as other efficiency measures to reduce the backlog.

It is not clear if the GOP will work hard to block these cheap labor, pro-employer, anti-employee spending programs — or just stage a theatrical opposition in public while they shrug their shoulders in closed door budget meetings.

However, the business-backed Democrats have the advantage because they hold slight majorities in the House and Senate after GOP leaders helped lose two January elections for Senate seats in Georgia.

Also, Congress usually stages the budget fights so that all the critical decisions are packed into massive budget bills in October. That strategy leaves the public with little way to track their legislators’ opposition to damaging budget requests.

The Biden document declares that the budget request “supports the promise of a fair and equitable immigration system that welcomes immigrants and reflects the Nation’s values.”

That sentence is likely a suggestion that the United States is a “Nation of Immigrants” rather than a nation of Americans.

But polls show that the “Nation of Immigrants” agenda is shared by only a minority of Americans, such as immigration lawyers, CEOs, and investors who profit from a socially chaotic inflow of diverse, low-wage migrants. Careful polls show that the vast majority of Americans believe that their American children and neighbors should be first in line for jobs, wages, housing, education, and other opportunities.

The funding request would eliminate spending on the border wall — but drastically ramps up spending on Democrats’ pro-migration and other priorities, including “climate change.”

The request wants funding for “Confronts Climate Change and Other Disaster Challenges,” saying:

The discretionary request expands DHS’s work with State and local communities to prepare for the impacts of climate change. The discretionary request invests an additional $540 million above the 2021 enacted level to incorporate climate impacts into pre-disaster planning and resilience efforts. This funding level also supports a resilient infrastructure community grant program, which prioritizes climate resilience projects for vulnerable and historically underserved communities. In addition, the discretionary request continues investments in the incident response workforce to ensure sufficient personnel are trained and available for deployment to help communities respond to future disasters. The discretionary request would also increase the number of FEMA staff equipped to support communities in order to prepare and respond to disasters in an equitable manner. … Revitalizes Research and Development Capacity. The discretionary request proposes $599 million for investments in research, development, and innovation across the Department, to lay a strong foundation for securing the American public from future threats. These projects would focus primarily on climate resilience, cybersecurity data analytics, and transportation security technologies.

For many years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.

The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.

The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money away from most Americans.

It moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.",1
318,Big Money Gobbles Single-Family Homes While Biden Plans to Build More,"President Joe Biden has revealed a $2.25 trillion dollar infrastructure proposal to build two million homes and apartments while big money funds are quickly scooping up nearly all available single-family homes.

According to the Hill, Biden’s proposal to build such housing “would spend four times the entire Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 2020 budget on a range of programs meant to fight a housing shortage exacerbated by the pandemic.”

Meanwhile, Jon Wanberg, a central Florida real estate broker and regional investor, says he is “getting offers from hedge funds on every listing … One acquisition manager told me that one of the many hedge funds he is working with is buying 500,000 residential homes,” Wanberg added.

Behind the curtain and before Biden proposed building more housing to mitigate the “affordability crisis,” he signed the coronavirus package in March, giving money in a “short-term bailout” to big money funds.

Research indicates pension funds invest around five percent of assets under management into hedge funds in a growing movement to adopt the asset class. Don Steinbrugge, CEO of hedge fund consulting firm Agecroft Partners, says the “Hedge fund industry assets under management will grow for the 11th time in 12 years in 2020.”

Indeed, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN) said of the bill, “there’s more money in this to bail out union pension funds than all the money combined for vaccine distribution and testing.” Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) also added, “Not only is [the Democrats’] plan totally unrelated to the pandemic, but it also does nothing to address the root cause of the problem.”

In essence, money ultimately originating from the American taxpayer was disbursed from government coffers to big money funds with massive purchasing power to buy homes and even whole housing developments, spurred by historically low interest rates, which Barron’s says is probable to increase inflation.

“Central bankers routinely deny any connection between their monetary policies and asset prices, even though that’s how those policies are transmitted to the real economy,” Barron’s reported on February 5. “’Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain,’ they all but insist, as the lightning and smoke jumps and hisses while they manipulate the controls, believing that they’re shrouded from view,” the financial outlet wrote.

Wanberg also believes inflation is coming due to the pandemic related stimulus with big money allocating their funds in relatively low-risk housing.

“And the signs of it are hedge funds trying to jump on the train before the train leaves the station,” which Wanberg warns may cause a “wealth divide,” and American workers who are receiving “their $600 checks can’t see it yet,” he told Breitbart News.

Wanberg reasoned, “The government is creating economic slaves and we are welcoming it and running to our mailboxes to pick up our stimulus checks. If you think the ‘Wealth Divide’ is bad now, just wait until hedge funds own all the real estate and you have to rent from them.”",1
319,Early Vote Counts Show Amazon Warehouse Workers in Alabama Rejecting Unionization,"Early vote counts at the Amazon warehouse facilities in Bessemer, Alabama, show workers voting overwhelmingly against forming a union.

A recent report from NBC News states that early vote-tallying at Amazon warehouses in Bessemer, Alabama, shows that the majority of workers appear to be voting overwhelmingly against forming. a union despite a months-long campaign from labor representatives to encourage unionization.

NBC News reports:

As vote-tallying paused for the night, 1,100 employees had voted against unionizing, compared to 463 in favor. The tally presented a nearly insurmountable climb for union supporters to obtain the 1,608 votes needed to win. If it is approved, the union would be the first for Amazon, the country’s second-largest employer, in the United States. While the vote has not been completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, has already said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election.

Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union commented: Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that, and we will be calling on the labor board to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behavior during the campaign. But make no mistake about it: This still represents an important moment for working people, and their voices will be heard.”

After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended on Marth 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by both the union and Amazon. Of the 5,805 eligible voters, 3,215 ballots were cast, but “hundreds” were set aside as Amazon contested them, according to the union.

320,Dingell: Dems Won’t Support Biden Infrastructure Plan Without SALT Consideration,"During a Thursday interview with Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) sounded off on President Joe Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure plan, which would come with raised corporate taxes.

According to Dingell, her Democratic colleagues will not support Biden’s bill without consideration of repealing the state and local tax (SALT) cap deduction.

“[A]s you talk about New York, New Jersey, California, those with high property taxes, I want to say to all of those states — your elected representatives, whether they’re Republican or Democrat, I wish the Republicans had worked a little hard maybe when SALT got into place, are working very hard to repeal, and I think we will not see them support the infrastructure bill,” Dingell advised. “I know my Democratic colleagues have made it very clear, the ones that are in New York and New Jersey, that they will not support an infrastructure bill, any kind of tax reform, that does not take SALT into account.”

“We have got to have a fairer tax system,” she added. “So, when you have corporate CEOs who are saying, you know, this is fair, I think we have got to look at it. But I think a lot of people are having conversations.”

321,Study: Biden ‘Infrastructure’ Tax Hike to Kill 1 Million US Jobs in Two Years,"A study conducted by Rice University economists John W. Diamond and George R. Zodrow found raising taxes similar to President Joe Biden’s tax hike of 28 percent would kill American “economic activity” and one million jobs in the first two years.

According to the study, “Total employment, measured by hours worked, would fall by 0.7% initially before moderating. The reduction in hours worked would be equivalent to an employment decline of approximately 1 million full-time jobs in 2023.”

The report details the negative impact:

The average annual reduction in employment would be equivalent to a loss of 600,000 jobs each year over 10 years. By 2023, GDP would be down by $117 billion, by $190 billion in 2026, and by $119 billion in 2031. Ordinary capital, or investments in equipment and structures, would be $80 billion less in 2023 and $83 billion and $66 billion less in 2026 and 2031, respectively. Investments in intangibles, or “firm-specific capital,” are highly mobile and more sensitive to marginal tax rate changes. Such investments would fall 2.7% by year two and would be down a total of 3.8% by year five. Real wages would fall by 0.6% in the long run, and total labor compensation, including wages and benefits, would decline by 0.6% initially before falling by 0.3% after 10 years. In the long run, total compensation would also decline by 0.6%.

National Association of Manufacturers, for whom the study was conducted, stated in an emailed press release, “[T]his study tells us quantitatively what manufacturers from coast to coast will tell you qualitatively: ‘increasing the tax burden on companies in America means fewer American jobs,'” adding, “One million jobs would be lost in the first two years, to be exact.”

National Republican Congressional Committee spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair also spoke to study’s findings. “While our country is still reeling from the coronavirus, Democrats want to destroy 1 million American jobs to fund their socialist agenda,” she wrote in a press release.

The study was conducted in relation to Biden’s infrastructure proposal, which aims to increase the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent, raising the rate above the 25 percent American businesses are taxed in Communist China.

Breitbart News reported Thursday the jobless claims grew to 744,000 for this week ending April 3rd. The economic outlook has many Democrats worried it might be too soon to raise taxes during a pandemic in which the economy is struggling to recover fully. Indeed, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) conveyed Monday there are six or seven Democrats who oppose raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.

House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) believes this is the wrong time to raise taxes. “When you raise taxes … companies start moving their jobs overseas again, like they were doing when we had high taxes a few years ago. That means we lose middle class jobs.”",1
322,Study: Biden Tax Hikes Will Cost 1 Million Jobs in First Two Years,"President Biden’s tax hike plan would cost the American economy one million lost jobs in the first two years, according to a study from the National Association of Manufacturers.

The study, released Thursday, details the long and short-term damage to the economy inflicted by Biden’s tax hikes and repeals of Trump’s pro-manufacturing policies.

NAM President and CEO Jay Timmons summarized the studies findings:

“After decades of advocating for a tax system that provided competitive rates and modern international tax provisions, manufacturers in America kept our promises following the enactment of the 2017 tax reforms: we raised wages and benefits, we hired more American workers, and we invested in our communities. If we undo those reforms, all of that will be put at significant risk. Manufacturing workers will lose out on jobs, growth and raises. We should be building on that progress, not rolling it back. But the conclusion of this study is inescapable—follow through with tax hikes that give other countries a clear advantage and we’ll see far fewer jobs created in America.”

The study, authored by Rice University economists John W. Diamond and George R. Zodrow, calculated the effects of increasing the corporate tax rate to 28%, increasing the top marginal tax rate, repealing the 20% pass-through deduction, eliminating certain expensing provisions, and taxing capital gains as ordinary income for individuals earning $1 million or more.

They found that the U.S. would lose one million jobs in the first two years, GDP would be $117 billion lower by 2023, and ordinary capital, or investments in equipment and structures, would be $80 billion less in 2023.

“There are some who are well-meaning and have suggested that the U.S. corporate tax rate should increase, but not by as much as the 28% proposed. Unfortunately, what that means is that America will still lose jobs and investment, just not quite as much. America just can’t afford that, especially now,” Timmons said.",1
323,IMF: Brexit Britain to Outgrow Eurozone and Biden’s America by 2022,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that Brexit Britain will grow faster than the Eurozone as well as the United States by next year, despite having one of the steepest contractions of any major Western nation during the Chinese coronavirus crisis.

The IMF’s April 2021 World Economic Outlook edition said that the UK is projected to grow by 5.3 per cent this year and 5.1 per cent in 2022, revising earlier projections up by 0.8 per cent. The Eurozone, by contrast, is merely expected to grow by 4.4 per cent this year and 3.8 per cent next year.

The economic outlook for the United States under President Joe Biden is also expected to falter, declining from 6.4 per cent growth in 2021 down to 3.5 per cent during the second year of the Democrat presidency.

The IMF said that the UK economy contracted by a massive 9.9 per cent in 2020, the most of any European country, with the exception of Spain.

The recession was caused in large part due to the draconian lockdown measures introduced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s nominally Conservative government, however, Britain is set to rebound as a result of a comparatively successful vaccination campaign.

“As the vulnerable population gets vaccinated, contact-intensive activities are expected to resume and drive a significant pickup in growth thanks to pent-up demand funded by accumulated savings in 2020,” the IMF report said.

The IMF did caution, however, that the economic projections for Britain will be dependent on the removal of lockdown restrictions on schedule.

Brexit Boom: 1,000 EU Financial Firms Set to Open in UK, London Named World’s Top Investment City https://t.co/X8YWashh0Y — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) February 24, 2021

The rosy outlook from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) seemingly repudiates the long-held anti-Brexit attitudes of the globalist institution.

Just prior to the 2016 EU referendum, then-IMF chief Christine Lagarde published a report claiming that Brexit would cost the United Kingdom half a million jobs.

The IMF went on to warn that merely leaving the EU would plunge the country into a recession, warning of “large contractions investment and consumption, implying lower output, lower growth, and higher domestic prices.”

The ability of the UK to fast-track coronavirus vaccine approvals — free from the bureaucratic restrictions of the European Commission — has widely been credited as a success of Brexit, with one German newspaper declaring that the disparity between the UK and the EU’s vaccine push has been “the best advertisement for Brexit.” Others have argued Brexit had nothing to do with the vaccine rollout, however, as despite European Union members acting collectively they theoretically could have decided not to.

In response to the latest positive economic projections, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the vaccine rollout and the gradual lifting of lockdown restrictions in Britain mean that “there are reasons for optimism, and we are paving the way for brighter times ahead.”

The investment bank Goldman Sachs was even more optimistic for the economic outlook for Brexit Britain, predicting that the economy could grow by as much as 7.1 per cent this year.

“This reflects the enormous improvement in the public health situation on the back of surging vaccinations – daily fatalities have fallen by a whopping 97% from their January peak – and the substantial room for rebound given the outsized 7.8% drop in real GDP through 2020,” said Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius.

324,Pro-Amnesty Groups Hide Americans' Huge Pocketbook Losses,"Up-by-his-bootstraps lawyer and would-be political candidate J.D. Vance has an answer to the academic economists who argue amnesties will not harm Americans’ wages and wealth.

“One of the things I had no idea about, coming from a working-class background, is that America’s ruling class loves to celebrate how much power and money it has,” Vance wrote in a March 18 Newsweek op-ed:

I call these “masters of the universe” events, and they’re held all over the country in fancy hotels, ski lodges and beach resorts. On this particular evening, my wife and I found ourselves at a roundtable with the CEO of a large hotel chain on our left, and a large communications conglomerate on our right. The Republicans, we’re often told, are the party of the rich and famous. Yet nearly everyone assembled at this dinner simply loathed Donald Trump. He was the focus of nearly every conversations. And then the hotel CEO announced, “Trump has no idea how much his policies are hurting business. I mean, we can’t keep people for $18 an hour in our hotels. If we’re not paying $20, we’re understaffed. And it’s all because of Donald Trump’s immigration policies.” Let’s pause for a second to appreciate one of the wealthiest men in the world complaining about paying hard-working staff $20 an hour. The only thing he was missing was the Monopoly Man hat and cane. His argument, while vile, was at least intellectually honest: “Normally, if we can’t find workers at a given wage, we just get a bunch of immigrants to do the job. It’s easy. But there are so few people coming in across the border, so we just have to pay the people here more.” This is why the American labor movement opposed immigration expansion for much of the past century—until recently, when many labor unions decided that being woke took priority over protecting workers.

Vance followed up with a March 18 tweet, saying, “We have a border crisis because Democratic donors love cheap labor.”

Vance’s story about wages is timely because business groups are pushing amnesty bills amid a barrage of PR that suggests amnesties are no threat to the wages of ordinary Americans.

For example, Mark Zuckerberg’s FWD.us advocacy group posted a multipage letter on February 12 by numerous economists who argued that Americans would gain from the flow of cheap, migrant labor.

OVERNIGHT: over 60 of the country’s most prominent economists released a letter urging the President & Congress to ensure a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants like Dreamers, TPS Holders, Farmworkers, Essential Workers in recovery package. https://t.co/7IB7xrMHQ3 — Todd Schulte (@TheToddSchulte) February 12, 2021

The February 11 letter by academic and activist economics started with the obvious “Prior research by the ​U.S. Department of Labor​ and independent academic analyses demonstrate that granting legal status raises the wages of beneficiaries.”

But the letter also claimed that other economists believe amnesty makes Americans’ wages go up:

A ​White House Council of Economic Advisers​ analysis of DAPA​ [President Barack Obama’s 2014 Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents quasi-amnesty] and ​other​ ​reports​ authored by economists … concluded that beyond the wage gains of program beneficiaries, legalization would increase the average wages of all Americans.

The letter’s claim of evidence for American wage gains rests on a thin, weak, and skewed base: A 2014 report by President Obama’s economic advisers — which concluded, “deferred action for low-priority [lower skilled] individuals would increase the wages of all native workers by 0.1 percent on average by 2024.” — plus two reports by the pro-migration Center for American Progress (CAP).

In turn, the two CAP reports rest on a few papers by a handful of pro-migration economists, chiefly “Gianmarco I.P. Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri.”

But in a March 2020 interview on BBC, Peri acknowledged reduced immigration helps to raise Americans’ wages. The BBC interviewer asked, “It may lead to wage growth, but this could be an overall economic problem for the United States?” Peri answered, “Indeed, indeed,” before arguing higher wages would curb companies’ ability to launch new projects.

The February 11 economists also argued amnestied migrants would enlarge the economy, raise total payroll for all U.S. workers, and boost tax revenues for governments. But those claims say nothing about average wages for individuals Americans.

“It’s like arguing that a town with 100 people is much richer when 50 new people move in because the economy is bigger,” responded Steven Camarota, the research director at the Center for Immigration Studies. “The original 100 people [may not] get any richer because a bigger economy doesn’t [automatically] mean that people make higher wages,” he told Breitbart News.

“If it did, Bangladesh would be considered a more wealthy country than New Zealand,” he added.

The February 11 economists also say amnesties will restore valuable workplace protections for Americans.

Those workplace conditions and rights have been damaged by employers hiring many illegal aliens, the economists admitted. But the proposed amnesties contain no safeguards against future illegal migration, so Vance’s story shows how employers will continue to undermine workplace rights by hiring waves of illegal aliens.

In fact, President Joe Biden’s main amnesty proposal would expand the inflow of blue-collar and white-collar foreign workers and would include no new curbs against the inflow of additional illegal aliens.

Representatives for FWD.us and for the lead author of the February 11 letter, Eileen Applebaum, declined to answer questions for Breitbart News.

Other pro-migration groups bombard legislators with claims amnesties and migration boost the economy — as if a bigger economy automatically translates into more wages for their voters. For example, Douglas Holtz-Eakin is president of the American Action Forum. He posted a March 9 op-ed at TheHill.com, arguing, “immigrants generally add to job creation and wage growth in the United States.”

A legal brief by economists for a 2015 lawsuit in Texas also touted gains for migrants, saying, “These benefits include increasing the ability of workers, immigrant and native alike, to access worker protections … there is little reason to predict countervailing economic harm to native-born workers and U.S. businesses.”

Sometimes, the academic economists who are recruited for these pro-amnesty letters sometimes include admissions that work against the lobbyists’ claims. Mike Bloomberg’s New American Economy group produced a 2017 letter from “1,470 economists” touting the economic benefits of immigration. But a close read of the 2017 letter shows the economists admitted wage losses:

Immigration undoubtedly has economic costs as well, particularly for Americans in certain industries and Americans with lower levels of educational attainment. But the benefits that immigration brings to society far outweigh their costs [to those Americans].

Sen. Mike Crapo steps back from his support for the House farm amnesty.

The deal would hammer rural towns in Idaho & elsewhere by replacing Americans with low-wage visa workers who take their wages home each year.

Local GOPers know where the votes are. https://t.co/zsEF4BLTfM — Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) March 24, 2021

But this barrage of credentialed PR does have an impact on media coverage: Few editors or reporters cover the economic impact of legal or illegal migration, despite its central impact on their readers’ and viewers’ wages, training, and housing prices.

Instead, many elite editors and reporters avoid dramatic fights over migration and money and prefer to showcase the interests of migrants.

“Research shows that immigrants strengthen the economy and typically don’t compete with U.S.-born workers for jobs or lower their wages,” says the August 2020 article in the Los Angeles Times by Molly O’Toole. She won the media industry’s Pulitzer award in 2020 for sympathetically covering migrants who were kept out of the United States and its labor market.

Three New York Times reporters, led by White House reporter Michael Shear, wrote on April 2020:

While numerous studies have concluded that immigration has an overall positive effect on the American work force and wages for workers, Mr. Trump ignored that research on Tuesday, insisting that American citizens who had lost their jobs in recent weeks should not have to compete with foreigners when the economy reopens.

Shear and his two peers linked to just one paper by one author to justify their claim. But the linked pro-migration author admitted in her 2018 paper that “research suggests that an increase in the share of low-skilled immigrants in the labor force decreases the price of immigrant-intensive services, such as housekeeping and gardening, primarily by decreasing wages among immigrants.”

Similarly, a three-byline article in Politico about President Biden’s immigration strategy ignored the economics. Biden’s deputies “want to change the very way Americans view migration.” The authors, Laura Barrón-López, Sarah Ferris, and Christopher Cadelago, even ignored the billions of dollars in remittances that migrants send home to support their families — even though that money is also used by corrupt governments to avoid political and economic reform. The article also avoids the U.S. side of the extraction-migration equation, even though many U.S. companies and donors gain from the induced inflow of poor workers and consumers.

In the fight over migration and wages, “it is extremely common for politicians, opinion writers, and reporters to claim ‘virtually all’ economists agree that immigration creates only winners, not losers,” Camarota wrote in a spring 2021 report for the National Association of Scholars. “There are some economists who say things like that, but that is not what the research shows … It is simply wrong to argue that economic research shows immigration has no negative effect on workers.”

Breitbart News asked Camarota to explain this widespread skew in reporting. “The people who lose [wages from immigration] tend to be younger, less educated, and less skilled,” he responded. “In other circumstances, we are often very concerned about that population because we recognize that they are already the poorest, the least likely to work, and haven’t seen very little wage increases in recent decades … But when the topic turns to immigration, we’re not supposed to worry about it.”

Breitbart News has reported many statements from CEOs and business groups saying that the federal policy of inflating the new labor supply with legal and illegal migrants does help to cut Americans’ wages.

For example, on page 171 of its September 2016 report, a pro-migration panel picked by the government-backed National Academies acknowledged “immigration imposes a tax on Americans” wages: “Immigrant labor accounts for 16.5 percent of the total number of hours worked in the United States, which … implies that the current stock of immigrants lowered [Americans’] wages by 5.2 percent.”

The admissions also come from independent academics, the National Academies of Science, the Congressional Budget Office, executives, The Economist, more academics, the New York Times, the New York Times again, state officials, unions, more business executives, lobbyists, the Wall Street Journal, federal economists, Goldman Sachs, oil drillers, the Bank of Ireland, Wall Street analysts, fired professionals, legislators, more economists, the CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 2015 Bernie Sanders, the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board, construction workers, New York Times subscribers, a former Treasury secretary, a New York Times columnist, a Bloomberg columnist, author Barack Obama, President Barack Obama, and the Business Roundtable.

Even the Wall Street Journal admitted in 2016:

Congress has failed to reach a compromise policy on immigration to address employer needs for a steady, legal workforce. On the ground in the U.S., many employers report the worker shortage is driving up wages, which is good news for low-skilled workers. It is also driving up costs, however, which could hamper investment and fuel inflation.

Much of the academic debate over migration and wages get dragged into micro-economic arguments about wages in Florida during the 1980s. But there is much macro-economic evidence for wage damage, said Camarota:

The main concern there that people often cite is long-term, the productivity gains seem to have all gone to owners of capital … [as]you would expect if immigration is transferring bargaining power from workers to business owners. That’s one piece of evidence. A related piece of evidence is the general lack of wage growth in real terms for most workers …

Wages for people with incomes halfway between top and bottom grew a total of just 8.8 percent from 1979 to 2019, according to a December 2020 report by the Congressional Research Service.

Median earnings of full-time, year-round workers, 15 years and older, 1960 to 2016.

Also, immigration drives up housing costs, cutting the disposable income in Americans’ pockets, especially for lower-income Californians. For example, retail workers must stay on the job for 94 hours per month to pay rent in California, according to Business.org. In low-migration West Virginia, retail workers can pay their rent with 43 hours of work. Similarly, nurses work 24 hours to pay their rent in West Virginia but 30 hours in California.

Some investors — such as Napster founder and FWD.us founder Sean Parker — are hoping to use immigration to drive up housing costs.

Migration also shifts investment and wealth from many interior states to a few coastal states. The shift happens because most investors live on the coasts, and they prefer to put their investment close to home. They face little pressure to put investments into the interior states because the government flies new white-collar and blue-collar immigrants into the coastal worksites each day. From 1995 to 2016, “the Bay Area actually increased its share of venture capital investment from 22 percent in 1995 to 46 percent in 2015 …. [New York] grew from just 3 percent in 1995 to more than 12 percent,” Bloomberg.org reported.

Camarota continued:

The third piece of evidence at a macro level is more of a question of political economy: Why do employers advocate for [more immigrant] workers so much? Whether you’re talking about farmers or owners or billionaire owners of a software company, or everything in between, they’re all advocating for immigration in the belief that it holds down wages for them. Their behavior is inexplicable if immigration doesn’t hold down wages.

For example, the February 11 letter was touted by FWD.us, which is playing a leading role in pushing for a 2021 amnesty.

Former President Donald Trump’s policies provided real-world evidence that reduced migration helps to raise the wages, working conditions, and the workplace authority of Americans.

In 2020, for example, the Census Bureau reported that median household wages rose by seven percent during 2019, following decades of minimal gains. A September 2020 report by the Federal Reserve concluded that the family median income level of high school graduates rose by six percent in 2019.

The amnesty bills being pushed by the investors at FWD.us do not include any useful measure to protect Americans, blue-collar or white-collar, from the next wave of illegal migrants, legal immigrants, or visa workers. In fact, the bill would help the business groups to import many white-collar workers for the jobs sought by the future American students of the pro-amnesty academics.

For years, a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young U.S. graduates.

The multiracial, cross-sex, non-racist, class-based, intra-Democratic, and solidarity-themed opposition to labor migration coexists with generally favorable personal feelings toward legal immigrants and toward immigration in theory — despite the media magnification of many skewed polls and articles that still push the 1950’s corporate “Nation of Immigrants” claim.

The deep public opposition is built on the widespread recognition that migration moves money away from most Americans.

It moves money from employees to employers, from families to investors, from young to old, from children to their parents, from homebuyers to real estate investors, and from the central states to the coastal states.

325,Corporate Leaders Urge Approval of Pro-Transgender Legislation,"In an op-ed at USA Today Wednesday, four U.S. corporate leaders urged their colleagues in business and industry to work to throw out state and federal legislation that seeks to protect children from life-altering transgender drugs and surgeries and to preserve women’s sports for women.

The leaders asserted such legislation is bad for their businesses.

Chris Adamo, Danone North America vice president of federal and industry affairs; Brad Figel, Mars, Inc. vice president of public affairs North America; Molly Fogarty, Nestlé USA senior vice president of corporate and government affairs; and Tom Langan, Unilever North America director of sustainable business and external affairs, used the narrative of the radical LGBTQ agenda to dismiss the serious life and health issues that children face when they are prescribed drugs that will likely make them sterile and irreversible surgeries to cope with perceived gender dysphoria.

This excellent piece of writing by Keira Bell is a must-read. Honest, insightful and a truly shocking indictment of the Tavistock care pathway. ""As I matured, I recognized that gender dysphoria was a symptom of my overall misery, not its cause.""https://t.co/rpRZEMVPxx — TransgenderTrend (@Transgendertrd) April 7, 2021

The corporate leaders referred to such bills and those that seek to preserve girls’ and women’s sports for females alone as “dangerous, discriminatory legislation.”

The business leaders appear to believe that measures such as the Equality Act and similar state-level legislation will provide LGBTQ individuals with the protections they say they need.

“This issue is not political,” they wrote. “Providing the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people as are provided to protected groups under federal law is the right thing to do for businesses and for society.”

The company leaders applauded Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) for vetoing a bill that would block transgender drugs and surgeries for minors, and lamented that the legislature overrode the governor’s veto.

“Such policies are out of step with the views of most Americans,” they wrote. “The overwhelming majority of Americans support full equality for LGBTQ+ people, according to recent data released by the Human Rights Campaign,” they added, though the leaders do not appear to have consulted the poll released by the feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF) in October.

WoLF commends the Arkansas House and Senate for upholding the health and wellness of its gender non-conforming youth #AbolishGender #GenderHurts https://t.co/GCXkGYGAbS — WoLF (@WomensLibFront) April 6, 2021

That poll found a majority of likely voters disapprove of policies related to “gender identity,” including those that would eliminate protections for women in single-sex public spaces, such as sports, shelters, and prisons.

The poll, which surveyed 3,500 likely voters across geographic regions, ethnicity, sex, and political affiliation, showed how unpopular such policies are in America, despite activist and media attempts to normalize them.

Even liberal voters, according to the poll, disapprove of efforts to undermine biological sex with gender ideology.

Overall, results found 66.93 percent of those polled say they “strongly disagree” with “gender identity” policies, including a majority of liberal voters.

More specifically, 66.96 percent of likely voters across parties say men or boys who identify as transgender should not be permitted to compete in women and girls’ sports.

Among the likely voters, 56.86 percent disagree with allowing men and boys who claim to identify as women in women’s and girls’ changing rooms; 53.19 percent disagree with permitting men in women’s homeless shelters; and 66.93 percent strongly disagree with policies allowing men who are sex offenders or domestic abusers to serve their sentences in women’s prisons.

A majority of likely voters (66.84 percent) also disapprove of minor children taking cross-sex hormones or undergoing sex-change surgeries such as double mastectomies.

A new poll conducted by Spry Strategies for WoLF found a majority of likely 2020 voters disagree with policies related to “gender identity” that would remove protections for women in single-sex spaces such as prisons, shelters, & sports.https://t.co/09PZa5IPXr — WoLF (@WomensLibFront) October 28, 2020

According to WoLF:

The poll also revealed that Black and Hispanic voters are more likely than white voters to support maintaining single-sex spaces, especially in prisons system and public services such as homeless shelters. Meanwhile, the wealthiest Americans (those with household incomes over $150,000) are the most likely to support these policies which are largely unpopular with middle-class voters. These results indicate that those most likely to actually be impacted by gender identity policies (poor or working-class families and people of color) are more likely to oppose them.

Natasha Chart, executive director of WoLF, said in a statement to Breitbart News at the time that “when faced with the consequences of the gender identity policies tucked into LGB nondiscrimination laws, like the Equality Act and Fairness For All, Americans understand that women’s rights and safety require that sex be recognized in law and custom.”

“They recognize that children need to be allowed to mature fully before making irreversible decisions about their future sexual health and fertility,” she added.

Ultimately, the corporate leaders made clear their primary interest is in keeping their companies competitive, a goal they believe they can achieve by reflecting woke culture.

“The ramifications of these discriminatory bills on states’ economic and financial health are also well-documented,” they wrote. “[F]or companies to engage new generations of workers and consumers, while fostering an environment good for people and for business, we must move beyond only public statements of support for LGBTQ+ issues.”",1
326,Caruzo: Venezuela Tries to Brand Alleged Corrupt Maduro Fundraiser New ‘Oskar Schdindler’,"CARACAS, Venezuela – The capture of Alex Saab — a Colombian businessman with deep ties to socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro and the regime of Venezuela — by U.S. authorities in Cape Verde has unleashed an ongoing diplomatic and legal war between the Maduro regime, Cape Verde, and the United States to prevent his impending extradition to the United States.

Saab, who has been described as Nicolás Maduro’s financial brain, was indicted by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2019 on charges of laundering approximately $350 million, allegedly moved out of Venezuela and through the United States to overseas accounts. Saab also allegedly enriched himself through the supply of housing materials for the late Hugo Chávez’s housing programs. His luxurious mansion in Colombia was seized by that country’s officials in 2020.

International criminal experts believe Maduro, along with the high-ranking members of the socialist party sanctioned by the U.S. government, heavily rely on money laundering to conduct their operations.

His apprehension took place in June 2020 when the private jet he was traveling to Iran in stopped in Cape Verde to refuel. From the very moment of his capture, the socialist regime has made unprecedented efforts to free this man, hiring former Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón for his defense – famous for issuing a warrant against former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet – and turning Saab into a hero overnight.

Maduro also appointed Saab ambassador of Venezuela to the African Union in December 2020 – meaning Saab would hypothetically be serving as an ambassador in Cape Verde police custody – in a gambit that sought to retroactively grant him a diplomatic immunity. With diplomatic immunity, Caracas hoped, his arrest would become invalid — a gross misuse of the stipulations of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961. It didn’t work.

After that failed, the socialist regime of Venezuela took a more public and broad approach while the court appeals took place. The idea was to further cement the narrative that Alex Saab was an unsung hero of the Bolivarian Revolution and Venezuela, that his “humanitarian” efforts were destined to bring aid to a country besieged by America — that all of his travels and journeys were meant to provide Venezuelans with the food and supplies that the U.S. sanctions allegedly have deprived us of.

Regime sympathizers declared Saab the “Oskar Schindler” of Venezuela – after the hero who saved 1,200 Jewish people from certain death under the German Nazi regime – and employed an army of online bots and human labor to artificially push hashtags praising the alleged international criminal.

Accounts operating in Venezuela have inorganically promoted and inflated the influence of hashtags such as #FreeAlexSaab with the help of Nigerian-based influencers expressing support for the African “ambassador.”

Twitter finally began to take action and recently suspended the accounts of the Nigerian influencers who boosted the hashtag, but there is no indication at press time that any action has been taken against the Venezuelan-based accounts that took part in it, government or otherwise — a stark contrast to the aggressive censorship standards imposed on, say, the accounts of conservative personalities in the U.S. This is consistent with Twitter’s inaction against Maduro for promoting false coronavirus cures on his personal account, seemingly the only account on the site that can get away with health misinformation.

At home, the Maduro regime has flooded the main streets and avenues in Caracas with pro-Saab propaganda – graffiti with messages of support towards Saab and opposition to his “unjust” apprehension. Even more ostentatiously, amid extreme poverty and a highly contagious pandemic, the Maduro regime staged a concert in Caracas on February 20 to clamor for the release of this “unsung” hero of the revolution — a musical event seemingly exempt from the regime’s Chinese coronavirus social distancing mandates and “7+7” lockdown schemes imposed on the country for almost a year now. Attendees received a bag of food as payment for their participation.

The CLAP program, a heavily subsidized monthly box of low-quality and often rotten food that the socialist regime of Venezuela distributes (and expects you to survive off of), is one of the most publicly known alleged corrupt business ventures between Alex Saab and the Venezuelan regime. Under threats from the regime, employees of the Salva Foods company, which handles the import and preparation of the CLAP box packages, denounced that they were forced to participate in activities and protests in support of Alex Saab.

As none of Maduro’s bells and whistles had any significant effect in swaying the courts of Cape Verde, the socialist regime then attempted a “humane” approach.

Letters sent by Saab’s family to the president of Cape Verde were meant to highlight of the allegedly inhumane treatment that Saab was being subject to, making note of his alleged weight loss and lack of access to medication. A series of testimonial videos published on YouTube and other social media websites tried to sell a sad story of an innocent man, father of five, unjustly detained. The subject of his weight loss was also part of a letter that Maduro’s foreign ministry sent to the government of Cape Verde.

Saab himself complained about the “inhumane” conditions of his house arrest in an interview he gave to the Russian state-controlled RT network.

It is hard for a Venezuelan citizen to feel any modicum of pity towards Saab’s “inhumane conditions,” as he is, basically, getting a taste of what the majority of the country here has to go through every day courtesy of the socialist regime — especially over the past decade. It’s hard to feel bad about his weight loss because, thanks to the socialist regime he works for, three out of four Venezuelans lost an average of 19 pounds in 2016, and getting three meals per day here is something not everyone gets to afford these days. The same goes for health and access to medicine, hygiene, and every other aspect of our lives down here. While Maduro’s regime laments Saab’s weight loss, the weight loss of millions of Venezuelans became one of Maduro’s favorite punchlines. “Maduro’s diet gets you hard – no need for Viagra!” he said in one of his accustomed televised broadcasts.

Despite all of the efforts undertaken by Socialist regime of Venezuela, and despite the fact that a court belonging to the Economic Community of West African States instructed Cape Verde to cease all of Saab’s extradition proceedings, the Supreme Court of Cape Verde ruled to allow the extradition of Alex Saab to the United States. As his impending extradition is closer with each passing day, the socialist regime of Venezuela reminded Saab not to cooperate with the U.S. government, out of tangible fear for what he may divulge.

While all that money, time, and effort to create the false narrative of a heroic Schindler-esque Alex Saab did not have the expected results, it serves as evidence of how this socialist regime will twist and bend context to suit its needs. They’ve been doing it for more than twenty years now, and they certainly don’t care if this exposes their actions any further, because, if I may paraphrase a common saying here, who’s going to notice a new stripe on a tiger? Their reputation can’t really get any worse.

The saga of Alex Saab, the corrupt Colombian businessman sold as a hero of the Bolivarian Revolution to the world, will continue in the courts of the State of Florida once his extradition takes place.

327,Watch: Illegals End Hunger Strike After Winning $2.1B in Aid from Cuomo,"Illegal aliens are ending their 23-day hunger strike after successfully lobbying New York state Democrats and Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to provide them with billions in taxpayer-funded aid.

While more than a million jobs have been lost in New York and an estimated 80,000 New York businesses may not make it to the end of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, Cuomo and state Democrats will provide $2.1 billion in stimulus checks and unemployment-style benefits to nearly 200,000 illegal aliens.

In comparison, as Breitbart News reported, small businesses devastated by the pandemic are receiving just $1 billion in tax credits and grants — $1.1 billion less than illegal aliens in the state.

Many illegal aliens who stand to benefit from the aid are ending the 23-day hunger strike they started last month, eating a meal at a victory rally on Wednesday.

Previous estimates suggested illegal aliens could receive up to $28,600 a year thanks to the taxpayer-funded benefits approved by Cuomo. Weekly, illegal aliens could receive $500. For those unemployed since March 2020, illegal aliens could receive, on average, $12,600.

New York, and particularly New York City, has been ravaged by Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio’s (D) economic lockdown measures that have now been in place for more than a year. Historic venues, hotels, restaurants, nightclubs, and local neighborhood spots have had to close their doors for good as a result of the lockdowns.

Those forced to close include The Roosevelt hotel in Midtown East, which opened in 1924; the Copacabana nightclub, which opened in 1940; The Paris Cafe, which opened in 1873; and Empire Coffee & Tea, which opened in 1908, among hundreds of others.

328,Amazon Backs Biden Tax Hike Plan After Years of Avoiding Federal Taxes,"Billionaire Jeff Bezos, CEO of multinational corporation Amazon, is endorsing President Joe Biden’s plan to hike the corporate tax rate after years of avoiding federal income taxes.

This week, Biden released the details of his tax hike plan that includes raising the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent.

In response, Bezos — who has boosted his wealth by more than 60 percent since March 2020 — said he supports the tax hike, though Amazon has a history of avoiding billions in federal income taxes.

“We support the Biden Administration’s focus on making bold investments in American infrastructure,” Bezos wrote in a statement:

Both Democrats and Republicans have supported infrastructure in the past, and it’s the right time to work together to make this happen. We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what’s included as well as how it gets paid for (we’re supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate). We look forward to Congress and the Administration coming together to find the right, balanced solution that maintains or enhances U.S. competitiveness. [Emphasis added]

Last year, as hundreds of thousands of small businesses were forced to close, Amazon had a pre-tax income of $20 billion. If Amazon had paid the 21 percent tax rate, the corporation would have owed $4.1 billion in federal income taxes.

Instead, Amazon dodged that tax rate and paid only $1.8 billion in federal income taxes, thus avoiding $2.3 billion in taxes. The figures indicate that Amazon paid a 9.4 percent tax rate.

For 2017 and 2018, Amazon paid $0 in federal income taxes. Even when Amazon does pay federal income taxes, it is well below the 21 percent tax rate and the rates that millions of working and middle class Americans must pay.

For example, in 2019, Amazon paid $162 million in federal income taxes despite $13.9 billion in pre-tax income for the year. This is a tax rate of just 1.2 percent, far lower than the 21 percent rate on corporations.

In comparison, an American earning $50,000 a year pays at least 8.6 percent in federal income taxes. In many cases, Americans earning just $15,000 a year have a higher federal income tax rate than that of Amazon’s in 2019.

330,Top Republican: DHS Must Stop Smugglers from Advertising on Facebook,"Rep. John Katko (R-NY) this week requested a briefing from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about its efforts to prevent social media platforms such as Facebook from allowing human smugglers to “brazenly” advertise guaranteed safe passage into the U.S.

Human smugglers, who are increasingly working with drug cartels knowledgeable of routes into the U.S., made over $400 million in February alone before the migrant surge intensified, the April 6 letter from Congressman Katko, the ranking member on the House Committee on Homeland Security, revealed.

Citing DHS estimates provided to his committee, he noted “traffickers raked in more than $400 million in the month of February alone — a number which has certainly grown proportionally as the number of migrants encountered at the border skyrocketed in March,” adding, “I am concerned that the spread of misinformation and advertisement of smuggling activity is only further exacerbating an increasingly untenable situation for frontline law enforcement personnel, as well as the vulnerable populations being exploited.”

DHS did not respond to Breitbart News’s request for comment by the time the article publicized.

However, an unnamed official from DHS, which keeps an eye on social media posts by potential migrants, told NBC News, which first reported the traffickers’ advertisement, that the lies spread by the smugglers on Facebook are partly to blame for the border crisis.

While Biden blames his predecessor for the crisis, Republicans say the migrant surge fueling the border problems is a result of the president rescinding the Trump administration’s border measures that managed to dramatically reduce illegal immigration near the end of his tenure.

Still, Rep. Katko said he is worried that the advertisement by human smugglers, known as coyotes, will worsen the border crisis.

“I am fearful that such advertising of nefarious activities on social media will continue to contribute to the humanitarian and security crisis facing the [DHS] as it encounters hundreds of thousands of migrants along the southwest border,” he said.

Breitbart News reached out to Facebook to no avail.

Nevertheless, NBC News learned from an unnamed spokesperson from the social media giant “that Facebook policy prohibits human exploitation and trafficking and that the company removes such content when it is identified or flagged by users [emphasis added].”

However, Facebook has hired so-called fact-checkers to flag or block news reports by conservative news outlets almost immediately after they are posted, without relying on users to do their work.

When it comes to human smugglers advertising their nefarious services, it was not until NBC News flagged the posts that Facebook removed them.

Unscrupulous coyotes exploit innocent people, including children, for monetary gain, at times leaving behind migrants who get hurt or are unable to keep up during the perilous journey. Some GOP lawmakers have accused coyotes of raping young women on the way to the United States.

Human smugglers and traffickers have figured out how to work the system and leverage President Biden's open border policies for their own gain. Under President Biden & VP Harris, we are losing control of our border. https://t.co/MNGDDiYawO — House Homeland GOP (@HomelandGOP) April 8, 2021

Via Facebook, the human smugglers falsely promise Central Americans a ‘100 percent’ safe journey into the United States for $8,000, NBC News found.

According to Bruno Lozano, the Democrat mayor of Del Rio, Texas, the lucrative profits made by human smugglers and drug cartels amid the border crisis may reverse “all the advances we’ve made to dismantle the cartels over the last decade.”

“They are making a killing off those who are destitute,” the mayor added.

The tentacles of social media platforms like Facebook reach nearly all corners of the world.

Early this month, Arizona National Guard Adjutant Gen. Michael McGuire told Fox News he believes human traffickers have launched a “worldwide marketing campaign” to smuggle people across the border.

Central American migrants primarily fuel the migrant surge.

However, the number of apprehended migrants from outside Latin America crossing the border illegally, namely from Africa, Asia, and Europe, has led the general to believe the Latin American cartels are marketing their services worldwide.

“We stop on average 10 individuals on the terrorist watchlist per day from traveling to or entering the United States,” DHS reported in 2019.

The migrant surge has overwhelmed resources such as detention space, forcing border authorities to release illegal migrants into U.S. communities, sometimes without court documents or coronavirus tests, forcing resources-strapped border communities to house, feed, and test them.

Although Biden is urging members of his party to blame Trump for the border crisis, Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) and other Democrats have criticized Biden’s approach to addressing the crisis by focusing on the root causes of migration, saying the U.S. has long been aware of what is driving migrants into America.

Cuellar and Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) suggested that Biden is wasting valuable time on determining the long-term root causes of migration rather than dealing with the problem now.",1
331,Exclusive: Stephen Miller Joins YAF’s Campus Lecture Program,"Stephen Miller, who served as senior advisor to the president for policy in the administration of former President Donald Trump, will be joining the conservative youth organization Young America’s Foundation (YAF) as part of its signature campus lecture program.

“Young America’s Foundation is excited to announce the addition of alumnus Stephen Miller to our one-of-a-kind campus lecture program,” said YAF to Breitbart News in a statement.

Miller “is one of the original and leading voices, thinkers and strategists of the America First Movement,” YAF added.

Governor Scott Walker, President of Young America’s Foundation, added: “Young America’s Foundation is thrilled to have Stephen Miller join our monumental campus lecture program. A longtime ally and alumnus of the Foundation, Miller is a great example of a freedom fighter–someone students can look up to as they navigate the conservative experience on campus. YAF will continue to ensure the rising generation has exposure to conservative viewpoints that all too often are left out of the classroom.”

Before serving as a senior adviser to Donald Trump’s campaign in 2016, Miller worked as communications director for Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL).

“Miller’s conservative activism started all the way back in high school — helping to re-instate a district policy that required the Pledge of Allegiance be recited in classrooms and made sure that the teachers at his high school talked about the Iraq War ‘in an even-handed way,'” YAF said.

The youth organization added that while a student at Duke University, Miller also hosted YAF’s “9/11: Never Forget Project,” and hosted a campus lecture featuring David Horowitz.

“YAF’s campus lecture program has reached millions of students across the country, and ensured a conservative perspective is heard on even the most liberal campuses,” the organization added. “Miller is an exciting addition to the lineup of speakers YAF hosts each year, and we are excited to continue advancing the conservative cause with him.”

Students across the country will be able to host Stephen Miller as a speaker on their campus next year.

332,Venezuela’s Maduro Admits to Cheating Facebook Ban with Wife’s Account,"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro told supporters in a nationally televised broadcast Wednesday that he is evading a currently active ban on posting to Facebook by using his wife’s, “First Combatant” Cilia Flores, account.

Maduro once again condemned the censorship of his page, a result of repeated postings promoting unproven and dangerous alleged coronavirus “cures,” as part of a “criminal persecution that the empire [the United States] has launched against our country.”

Facebook banned Maduro from posting from his official page for 30 days on March 26 and deleted a video he posted promoting “Carvativir,” an oil made of thyme and oregano, as an alleged coronavirus cure. Maduro and his illegitimate socialist regime refer to Carvativir as “miracle droplets” and claim it eliminates Chinese coronavirus infections. Maduro has also extensively promoted the use of ozone to cure coronavirus infections; the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not authorized the use of ozone in this manner — or to disinfect surfaces and products — because the amount of the gas it takes to kill coronavirus cells is higher than the amount a human being can safely ingest.

Facebook terms of use appear to prevent users whose content prompts restrictions on their account from evading the limitations through other accounts. In a recent example, Facebook officials warned Lara Trump last month that an interview she promoted on the site with her father-in-law, former President Donald Trump, would violate Facebook regulations because the former president himself cannot use the platform.

Maduro told viewers on his state propaganda network, VTV, on Wednesday, that a group online chat between himself and representatives of Venezuela’s 24 states was being broadcast concurrently on Facebook live through Flores’ account, essentially allowing him a live, unregulated platform on the social media network.

“We are now connecting with the leaders of the promoting committees of every municipality in the country and through social media, through Facebook live, through the account of my wife, Cilia Flores,” Maduro said, “since, as you all know, they censored by [sic] Facebook live over making recommendations for the health of the people, for tending to the pandemic in Venezuela.”

The video remains available on Flores’ official Facebook page at press time.

“Facebook got the idea to censor me. We sent our official complaint to the Facebook company and they haven’t responded,” Maduro added. “They haven’t answered the letters we have sent in more than 15 days, so Cilia lends me her Facebook and you guys can connect there through your Facebook.”

Maduro went on to accuse Facebook of attempting to create “a new hegemony” alongside unnamed “multinational corporations” to censor socialists.

Facebook confirmed to several news organizations in late March that it had locked the Venezuelan socialist dictator out of his official page for 30 days and deleted a video promoting false coronavirus cures.

“We removed a video posted to President Nicolás Maduro’s page for violating our policies against misinformation about Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] that is likely to put people at risk for harm,” a spokesperson told the BBC at the time. “We follow guidance from the W.H.O. [World Health Organization] that says there is currently no medication to cure the virus. Due to repeated violations of our rules, we are also freezing the page for 30 days, during which it will be read-only.”

Facebook has yet to weigh in officially on Maduro’s return to Facebook through his wife’s account. The Facebook “help” website — in response to the question “If a person is ban [sic] from Facebook for 30 days. Are they allowed to have a second account?” — appears to consider the practice a violation of terms of use.

“We disable Facebook accounts that don’t follow the Facebook Terms. If your account has been disabled, we ask that you wait until your block has been lifted,” the page, from 2015, reads. “Furthermore, having two Facebook accounts is against policy and can often times result in another temporary block.”

Facebook’s action against the potential publication of an interview with former President Trump also appears to be consistent with this policy. Following her announcement of an upcoming interview with Trump, Lara Trump published the content of a message she received from a Facebook operative warning her not to upload the video.

“Content posted on Facebook and Instagram in the voice of President Trump is not currently allowed on our platforms (including new posts with President Trump speaking) and will be removed if posted, resulting in additional limitations on accounts that posted it,” the message read.

Venezuela is currently suspected to be enduring a severe coronavirus crisis, though official statistics published by the Maduro regime indicate a much smaller national epidemic than in neighboring free states like Colombia and Brazil. Even Maduro’s statistics have repeatedly broken one-day records in the number of cases in the country in the past week, however, suggesting a worsening problem. At press time, Venezuela has documented 170,189 cases of Chinese coronavirus nationwide and 1,705 deaths, compared to millions of cases in the two aforementioned South American countries.

Venezuelans largely distrust the regime. A poll published this weekend found over 80 percent of Venezuelans nationwide do not believe the official coronavirus numbers, a slight increase in distrust from the results of a similar poll in October.

Maduro has not been legally president of Venezuela since January 2019, when his last legitimate term expired.

333,YouTube Censors Coronavirus Roundtable Hosted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis,"Google-owned YouTube took down a video of a roundtable conference hosted by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), featuring former White House coronavirus task force member and medical scholar Scott Atlas, and the three co-authors of the Great Barrington Declaration.

The Great Barrington declaration argues that blanket lockdowns and mask mandates are counterproductive, instead advocating for a targeted approach focused on protecting vulnerable segments of the population.

The three co-authors, who attended Gov. DeSantis’ roundable, are Harvard professor of medicine Martin Kulldorff, Oxford professor of epidemiology Sunetra Gupta, and Stanford professor of medicine and epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya.

Via the American Institute for Economic Research:

The efforts in Florida to protect the elderly while permitting the rest of society to function normally led to a success that has been celebrated the world over. It causes major disruption to the lockdown narrative that the only way to suppress a virus is to suppress rights and freedoms. As a retrospective on the policy, the governor held a roundtable with all four scientists. Lasting an hour and a half, they covered all the major issues. The video itself came to serve as a tutorial in the relationship between public policy and virus mitigation. With no warning, no announcement, and no explanation, YouTube on April 7, 2021, suddenly deleted the entire video from its platform. Once hosted by WTSP Tampa Bay, an NBC affiliate, it originally appeared as embedded in a story on WTSP.com. The video that once lived here is now replaced by this.

This is the second time in two weeks that Kulldorff, who servers on a vaccine safety subgroup that advises the CDC, FIH, and FDA, has faced Big Tech censorship. On March 30, the widely-cited epidemiologist was censored by Twitter over a post challenging the notion that children and young people require vaccination against COVID-19.

334,Paris Decries Social Media ‘Smear Campaign’ Highlighting Dirty Streets,"Paris’s city government has criticised a “smear campaign” after a hashtag spread among French social media users showed pictures of the capital with garbage piled up on the streets.

The hashtag “#saccageparis” which translates to “trashed Paris”, was denounced by the French capital’s local government as Twitter users posted pictures of the city showing rubbish covering streets and other areas.

“Like all cities in France, Paris is faced with incivility and problems of regulating public space,” the official Paris city Twitter account stated, and claimed that many photos had been posted before cleaning teams had dealt with issues, noting that 2,500 personnel clean the streets of the city “every day”.

However, the account did admit that due to the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, the number of cleaning staff in Paris had been reduced by ten per cent and said that the reduction might lead to some delays for cleaning.

Ah Paris 😍

Populist National Rally (RN) leader Marine Le Pen commented on the hashtag, saying: “The thousands of images shared with the hashtag #SaccageParis break the hearts of lovers of Paris. Bravo to the revolted Parisians!”

“The degradation of our beautiful capital by the Hidalgo team is a national suffering that should not leave any of the French indifferent,” she added.

In an interview with broadcaster RTL on Tuesday, Paris’s first deputy mayor Emmanuel Gregoire admitted, “yes, cleanliness has always been a problem in Paris,” but still claimed the hashtag was a “political attack”.

The campaign is just the latest in which Parisians have complained about how the local government under leftist Mayor Anne Hidalgo has been running the city in recent years.

Residents of the 17th district of Paris went as far as threatening to take security matters into their own hands earlier this year after complaining that the government and police were not doing enough to stop growing crime levels.

Locals also criticised the government in October of last year after the announcement that the Hidalgo administration would be looking at opening “shooting rooms” for crack addicts.

335,Peter Thiel: 'Woke' Big Tech Don't Think of Themselves as American,"Tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel said Tuesday that American Big Tech companies do not consider themselves to be “American companies” due to “woke politics” and because their employees — particularly Chinese nationals — are sympathetic to the Chinese Communist Party on some issues.

Thiel said during a virtual discussion hosted by former Secretary of State Michael Pompeo:

If you look at the big five tech companies — Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft — virtually very, very little presence in China. So they aren’t naturally a pro-China constituency. Apple is probably the one that’s structurally a real problem because the whole iPhone supply chain gets made from China, and Apple is one that has real synergies with China. But then, there’s something about the woke politics inside these companies, the way they think of themselves as not really American companies. And it’s somehow very, very difficult to, for them to have a sharp anti-China edge of any sort whatsoever. [Emphasis added.] At Facebook, I’ll give you an example. You had with the Hong Kong protest a year ago, the employees from Hong Kong were all in favor of the protests and free speech. But there were more employees at Facebook who were born in China than who were born in Hong Kong. And the Chinese nationals actually said that, you know, it was just Western arrogance and shouldn’t be taking Hong Kong’s side and things like that. And then the rest of the employees at Facebook sort of stayed out of it. But the internal debate felt like people were actually more anti-Hong Kong than pro-Hong Kong.

Thiel was responding to a question about China’s advantages on tech vis-à-vis the United States. The discussion was the Richard Nixon Foundation’s inaugural Nixon Seminar hosted by co-chairmen Pompeo and former National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien.

O’Brien slammed Silicon Valley progressives supporting woke policies at home but then ignoring human rights abuses abroad:

So in Silicon Valley, we’ve got, it’s a very woke industry in general about what’s happening here. And yet it’s not very woke in what’s happening to the Uyghurs, what’s happening to the Tibetans, what’s happening to the democrats with a small “d” in Hong Kong, the threats against Taiwan where you’ve got the indigenous people of Taiwan. So, there seems to be less concern about those folks in Silicon Valley and industry in general than the concern for woke progressive politics here. How are they surprised and how do they get their conscience back when it comes to folks around the world? Maybe even victims of environmental disaster?

Thiel said there are plenty of issues for which the woke left could criticize China, such as their environmental or human rights record.

“If you’re concerned about climate change, maybe the tariffs the Trump administration put on China were way too small. They should be much higher, even the carbon tax should be higher because they use coal power. Even the electric cars in China are dirty; they’re dirtier than oil-power cars than China. But somehow it’s very difficult to talk about this stuff coherently,” he said.

He recalled speaking with some Google employees working in artificial intelligence technology and asking them, “Is your AI being used to run the concentration camps in Xinjiang?” He said they responded, “Well, We don’t know and don’t ask any questions.”

“You have this almost magical thinking that by pretending everything is fine, that’s how you engage and have a conversation. And you make the world better. And it’s some combination of wishful thinking. It’s useful idiots, you know, it’s CCP fifth column collaborators,” he said.

“I’m tempted to say it’s just profoundly racist. It’s like saying that because they look different, they’re not white people, they don’t have the same rights. It’s something super wrong. But I don’t quite know how you unlock that,” he added.

Nixon’s grandson, Christopher Nixon Cox, who also participated in the seminar, noted that Thiel put policies in place at the company he founded, Palantir, to not make deals with countries that are not on good terms with the United States.

“That’s such a great leadership position you’ve taken in Silicon Valley and I really commend you for that because that’s going to be the big issue — Where does big tech fall in the divide with United States and China? So I commend you with that.”

336,Parler Interim CEO Meckler on Big Tech: ‘They Saw Us as a Threat and They Colluded to Take Us Down’,"Wednesday on FNC’s “Fox & Friends First,” Parler interim CEO Mark Meckler sounded off on efforts by big tech to deplatform his social media site.

Meckler, who is working to have the Parler app back in the Apple store, said that the conservative social media platform was part of a “hit job” because big tech wanted “to suppress the conservative point of view.” According to the interim CEO, Parler was seen as a “threat” because conservatives were flocking to the platform.

“[T]here is definitely a double or triple standard here,” Meckler lamented.

Host Lawrence Jones asked, “Do you think they are trying to suppress the conservative point of view?”

“Absolutely, they are trying to suppress the conservative point of view,” Meckler replied. ‘Most of this was just a hit job done started by Facebook by Sheryl Sandberg pointing at Parler when it absolutely wasn’t the truth. I believe there was cooperation, potentially conspiracy and collusion between these companies. They don’t like us out there. They don’t like the competition. At the time that we were taken off the app store, we were the number one downloaded app. We were the number 10 downloaded app for the entire year of 2020, so they saw us as a threat, and they colluded to take us down.”

337,"Peter Thiel Criticizes Big Tech Censorship, Banning of Donald Trump","Palantir founder and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel criticized Big Tech companies for banning Donald Trump and other conservatives yesterday, in a roundtable discussion hosted by the Richard Nixon Foundation.

The billionaire tech mogul, who was an early investor in Facebook and sits on the company’s board, was one of the few major figures in Silicon Valley to back Donald Trump in 2016, speaking at that year’s GOP convention in support of the future president. His remarks were made to The Nixon Seminar.

Thiel covered numerous topics in his remarks, including a lengthy critique of the tech industry’s overly-close relationship with China.

He also addressed the issue of tech censorship, saying that invisible censorship, or “downranking” is even more dangerous than outright bans.

“I think there has been lots of deplatforming of conservatives and I always think that the actual censorship that people talk about is just the tip of the iceberg and the real problem is the downranking,” said Thiel. “One of the top Google executives used to always say 5 or 6 years ago we never censor anybody we just downrank people and the downranking was the far more insidious way to sort of tilt the playing field of the discourse.”

“But there has been outright censorship, outright deplatforming,” continued Thiel. “And when you do it with the President of the United States, that does feel like you really crossed some kind of Rubicon where, you know, I’m not sure you declare war on half the country, but maybe a third, forty percent of the country and that seems really crazy.”

“When you have Angela Merkel and Obrador from Mexico saying that the tech platforms have been too anti-Trump, too mean to Mr. Trump, that tells you you have probably really overreached.”

338,‘Small Business Rising’ Coalition Targets Amazon’s Monopoly Power,"According to a recent report, merchant groups representing thousands of small businesses are forming a national coalition called “Small Business Rising” to campaign for stricter antitrust laws in an effort to force e-commerce giant Amazon to spin off some of its business lines and stop selling its own products in competition with other brands and sellers.

The Wall Street Journal reports that a number of merchants are forming a national coalition to campaign for stricter antitrust laws to force Amazon to spin off some of its business lines. The effort is being launched by trade groups representing smaller hardware stores, office suppliers, booksellers, grocers, and others on Tuesday.

Business groups from 12 cities are also joining the coalition, according to organizers. Merchants reportedly plan to push their congressional representatives for stricter antitrust laws and tougher enforcement of existing laws.

The groups collectively represent thousands of businesses and want federal legislation that would prevent the owner of a dominant online marketplace such as Amazon from selling its own products in competition with other sellers. This policy would effectively separate Amazon’s retail product business from its online marketplace entirely.

Members of the House Antitrust Subcommittee are reportedly considering legislation similar to these guidelines already as they consider changes to U.S. antitrust law, but no bill has been formally introduced.

An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement that the company’s critics “are suggesting misguided interventions in the free market that would kill off independent retailers and punish consumers by forcing small businesses out of popular online stores, raising prices, and reducing consumer choice and convenience.”

The spokesperson added: “Amazon and third-party sellers complement each other, and sellers having the opportunity to sell right alongside a retailer’s products is the very competition that most benefits consumers and has made the marketplace model so successful for third-party sellers.”

The newly formed coalition has been dubbed Small Business Rising and includes the National Grocers Association, the American Booksellers Association, and the Alliance for Pharmacy Compounding. The group aims to capitalize on local business owners’ connections to their hometowns by meeting with members of Congress and staff, seeking coverage in media, and other efforts.

Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, commented: “Those stories are powerful and are motivating for lawmakers. It’s a real business that is really going to go under with a real community that is going to suffer as a result.”

339,Wired: Massive Facebook Data Breach Was Caused by Poorly Coded Features,"Following the latest Facebook data breach which leaked the personal details of over 500 million users, Wired has explained what exactly caused the major data breach. According to the progressive tech outlet, the massive trove of personal data was “created by abusing a flaw in a Facebook address book contacts import feature.”

Breitbart News recently reported that hackers published the phone numbers and personal data of 533 million Facebook users, including users’ full names, locations, phone numbers, and email addresses.

A user in a low level hacking forum on Saturday published the phone numbers and personal data of hundreds of millions of Facebook users for free online. The exposed data includes personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and — in some cases — email addresses. Insider reviewed a sample of the leaked data and verified several records by matching known Facebook users’ phone numbers with the IDs listed in the data set. We also verified records by testing email addresses from the data set in Facebook’s password reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user’s phone number.

Now, Wired has examined the data in-depth and has provided more context to how the latest Facebook data breach took place. Wired notes that Facebook’s initial response to the leak was that the data was previously reported on in 2019 and that the company had fixed the underlying vulnerability in August of that year.

But according to Wired, the data which first appeared on the dark web in 2019 came from a breach that the social media giant did not disclose in detail at the time and only acknowledged took place earlier this week in a blog post from the company’s product management director Mike Clark. Wired states that the dataset was “created by abusing a flaw in a Facebook address book contacts import feature.”

Wired writes:

One source of the confusion was that Facebook has had any number of breaches and exposures from which this data could have originated. Was it the 540 million records—including Facebook IDs, comments, likes, and reaction data—exposed by a third party and disclosed by the security firm UpGuard in April 2019? Or was it the 419 million Facebook user records, including hundreds of millions of phone numbers, names, and Facebook IDs, scraped from the social network by bad actors before a 2018 Facebook policy change, that were exposed publicly and reported by TechCrunch in September 2019? Did it have something to do with the Cambridge Analytica third-party data sharing scandal of 2018? Or was this somehow related to the massive 2018 Facebook data breach that compromised access tokens and virtually all personal data from about 30 million users? In fact, the answer appears to be none of the above. As Facebook eventually explained in background comments to WIRED and in its Tuesday blog, the recently public trove of 533 million records is an entirely different data set that attackers created by abusing a flaw in a Facebook address book contacts import feature. Facebook says it patched the vulnerability in August 2019, but it’s unclear how many times the bug was exploited before then. The information from more than 500 million Facebook users in more than 106 countries contains Facebook IDs, phone numbers, and other information about early Facebook users like Mark Zuckerburg and US secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, as well as the European Union commissioner for data protection, Didier Reynders. Other victims include 61 people who list the “Federal Trade Commission” and 651 people who list “Attorney General” in their details on Facebook.

If the latest data leak came from a source other than the hack Mark Zuckerberg’s company revealed in 2019 and it wasn’t disclosed, it could spell major trouble for the firm. Former FTC Chief Technologist Ashkan Soltani commented: “At what point did Facebook say, ‘We had a bug in our system, and we added a fix, and therefore users might be affected’? I don’t remember ever seeing Facebook say that. And they’re kind of stuck now, because they apparently didn’t do any disclosure or notification.”

Wired notes:

Before its blog acknowledging the breach, Facebook pointed to the Forbes story as evidence that it publicly acknowledged the 2019 Facebook contact importer breach. But the Forbes story is about a similar yet seemingly unrelated finding in Instagram versus main Facebook, which is where the 533-million-user leak comes from. And Facebook admits that it did not notify users that their data had been compromised individually or through an official company security bulletin.

340,Indiana AG Begins Probe into Five Big Tech Corporations & Vanita Gupta,"Indiana Attorney General has begun investigations into five Big Tech corporations for censorship of conservative content involving Joe Biden’s nominee, Vanita Gupta.

The probe includes companies Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Twitter over whether they have “harmed Indiana consumers through business practices that are abusive, deceptive and/or unfair.”

Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita said, “In a free society, few assets are more important to consumers than access to information and the opportunity to express political viewpoints in meaningful forums.” Adding, “It is potentially harmful and unfair for these companies to manipulate content in ways they do not publicly discuss or that consumers do not fully understand.”

The Attorney General also said he is investigating Vanita Gupta over suspected actions to foster the five Big Tech companies to censor conservative viewpoints. “Gupta, who is President Joe Biden’s nominee to be associate U.S. attorney general,” Rokita writes, “has allegedly met with Facebook and Twitter executives to urge ‘more rigorous rules and enforcement,’ to use her own words as quoted in Time.”

“Gupta, according to the Time article, stressed that it was important for social media platforms to be ‘tagging things and taking them down,'” Rokita concludes.

Breitbart News reported that 11 Republican Senators demanded a second committee hearing for Gupta over “her misleading statements, and for her refusal to respond to our written questions.” But Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-IL) hurriedly rushed Gupta to a vote in a second committee meeting, cutting off Sen. Tom Cotton’s (R-AR) statements in a show of hardball partisan politics.

Indeed, many questions remain about Gupta’s stock holding in a family enterprise that sold acetic anhydride to Mexican cartels, which is used to make high-grade ‘china white’ heroin and methamphetamine. Gupta has also been a proponent of raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour while also owning stock in her family’s company which pays its Mexican labor force $1.30 an hour.

The head-turning headlines have raised concerns for Judicial Crisis Network, which has urged Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) to vote “no” on her confirmation. However, Manchin has indicated he will likely vote to confirm Gupta. “I have spoken to Merrick Garland — and he is very high on her,” Manchin said. “And I have all the respect in the world on his decision-making. I will be leaning towards because of his support.”",1

342,Analyst: Apple’s Revenue Will Grow Thanks to Its Deal with Google to Control the Internet,"According to analysts, Apple’s search engine deal with fellow tech giant Google is expected to be a primary source of service revenue growth for the company.

MacRumors reports that Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty raised her services-related revenue forecast for Apple through the 2022 fiscal year, largely driven by the company’s search engine deal with Google.

Breitbart News reported in October of 2020 that the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google. 11 states also joined the DOJ action against the internet giant. The lawsuit claimed that the company engaged in anticompetitive practices in order to preserve monopolies in the search and advertising components that make up huge sections of the tech firm’s main business.

The New York Times later outlined one deal between Apple and Google that was reportedly an area of focus in the case. The deal cemented Google as the primary search engine on Apple’s devices, funneling massive amounts of traffic to the search giant.

The New York Times stated:

When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple and Google, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley. As the two men sipped red wine at a window table inside the restaurant in Palo Alto, their companies were in tense negotiations to renew one of the most lucrative business deals in history: an agreement to feature Google’s search engine as the preselected choice on Apple’s iPhone and other devices. The updated deal was worth billions of dollars to both companies and cemented their status at the top of the tech industry’s pecking order. Now, the partnership is in jeopardy. Last Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit against Google — the U.S. government’s biggest antitrust case in two decades — and homed in on the alliance as a prime example of what prosecutors say are the company’s illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search.

Now, Huberty states that stronger licensing revenue is the primary driver of raised estimates for Apple, including an acceleration in the search traffic-related payments Appler receives from Google.

The NYT stated that Apple receives an estimated $8-12 billion per year in exchange for making Google the default search engine across iOS devices. Huberty stated:

Following strong March quarter App Store results and an analysis of the key drivers of Apple’s Licensing & Other segment, we raise our already above-street FY21 and FY22 Services revenue estimates by 3% and 5% respectively, and are increasingly convinced that consensus Services forecasts over the next 2+ years are too low.

However, Huberty lowered her 12-month price target for Apple to $155 from $164 per share, stating:

However, multiple compression over the last 2 months, primarily at Apple’s higher growth Services peers, more than offsets our higher revenue and earnings estimates, driving our new sum-of-the-parts based price target to $156, or 33x FY22 EPS, down from $164 previously.

343,Yelp Introduces ‘Asian-Owned Business’ Search Filter,"The business review app Yelp has added “Asian-owned” to its list of available company profile attributes in an attempt to promote Asian businesses.

SearchEngineLand reports that the restaurant and business review app Yelp has added “Asian-owned” to its list of available business profile attributes. The company said in a statement this week:

With the escalation of anti-Asian hate crimes and violence we’ve seen across the nation during the pandemic, there’s never been a more important time to support the Asian American community.

According to Yelp’s Local Economic Impact Report, in February 2021 overall searches for women, Asian, Black, and Latino-owned businesses were up by 2,930 percent compared to February 2020. On Yelp, searches for Asian-owned businesses increased by 130 percent year-over-year for the same period.

Breitbart News previously reported on the introduction of Yelp’s Black-owned business tag, writing:

Business review site Yelp announces that it will provide a special search feature on its platform so that users can limit their results to black-owned businesses. “We see you. We support you,” said Yelp in its announcement that it will build a feature to let businesses “to identify themselves as Black-owned” on the site. Yelp says that its goal is to “make it easy for users to find and support Black-owned businesses on Yelp.” “Our country has a long and fraught history of systemic oppression and anti-Black racism that we have shamefully not yet come close to overcoming,” wrote Yelp Co-founder and CEO Jeremy Johnson in an email to the company’s subscribers. Johnson’s remarks arrive in the wake of nationwide protests which have devolved into violent riots over the death of George Floyd in police custody.

In October 2020, Yelp introduced a “business accused of racist behavior” consumer alert. Following the launch of the alert, a temporary halt was placed on new reviews to prevent profiles from being flooded with non-customer reviews objecting to the accusations of racism.

345,Clarence Thomas: Supreme Court Will Soon Have to Address Tech Censorship,"Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas today outlined a detailed legal argument for why social media companies might need to be subject to strict rules forbidding them from denying service to users for any reason or no reason, including the possibility of designating them as common carriers — which would effectively eliminate their ability to ban or censor users for legal, First Amendment protected speech.

Thomas outlined his opinion in a concurrence to reject a case that began under the Trump administration, challenging the President’s right to block users from his Twitter feed.

However, Thomas indicated that the Supreme Court will soon have to address the issue of tech censorship.

“We will soon have no choice but to address how our legal doctrines apply to highly concentrated, privately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms” wrote Thomas.

Such a case would likely encompass many of the complaints brought by conservatives against social media companies. Social media censorship has intensely escalated over the past few years, with targets of bans and censorship including elected officials like President Trump, political candidates like Laura Loomer, and news organizations like Breitbart News and the New York Post.

Thomas also noted other cases that raised concerns about digital platforms’ control over speech. On the rejected case brought by Loomer and Freedom Watch last year, Thomas noted that it highlighted “two important facts.”

Today’s digital platforms provide avenues for historically unprecedented amounts of speech, including speech by government actors. Also unprecedented, however, is the concentrated control of so much speech in the hands of a few private parties.

The case addressed by Thomas was brought on the basis that the president is a public official, and that his feed should thus be considered a constitutionally protected public forum, therefore implying that the President cannot bar users from his feed via the block feature.

Thomas argued that Twitter’s decision to ban President Trump proved that Twitter, not the President, controlled whether citizens could interact with him.

The disparity between Twitter’s control and Mr. Trump’s control is stark, to say the least. Mr. Trump blocked several people from interacting with his messages. Twitter barred Mr. Trump not only from interacting with a few users, but removed him from the entire platform, thus barring all Twitter users from interacting with his messages.

Despite rejecting the Twitter blocking case, Thomas went on to note many of the issues with social media censorship, and suggested that tech platforms might be considered common carriers or places of public accommodation, both of which are tightly restricted in their ability to deny service.

If part of the problem is private, concentrated control over online content and platforms available to the public, then part of the solution may be found in doctrines that limit the right of a private company to exclude. Historically, at least two legal doctrines limited a company’s right to exclude. First, our legal system and its British predecessor have long subjected certain businesses, known as common carriers, to special regulations, including a general requirement to serve all comers. Candeub, Bargaining for Free Speech: Common Carriage, Network Neutrality, and Section 230, 22 Yale J. L. & Tech. 391, 398–403 (2020) (Candeub) see also Burdick, The Origin of the Peculiar Duties of Public Service Companies, Pt. 1, 11 Colum. L. Rev. 514 (1911). Justifications for these regulations have varied. Some scholars have argued that common-carrier regulations are justified only when a carrier possesses substantial market power. Candeub 404. Others have said that no substantial market power is needed so long as the company holds itself out as open to the public. Ibid.; see also Ingate v. Christie, 3 Car. & K. 61, 63, 175 Eng. Rep. 463, 464 (N. P. 1850) (“[A] person [who] holds himself out to carry goods for everyone as a business . . . is a common carrier”). And this Court long ago suggested that regulations like those placed on common carriers may be justified, even for industries not historically recognized as common carriers, when “a business, by circumstances and its nature, . . . rise[s] from private to be of public concern.” See German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U. S. 389, 411 (1914) (affirming state regulation of fire insurance rates). At that point, a company’s “property is but its instrument, the means of rendering the service which has become of public interest.” Id., at 408. This latter definition of course is hardly helpful, for most things can be described as “of public interest.” But whatever may be said of other industries, there is clear historical precedent for regulating transportation and communications networks in a similar manner as traditional common carriers. Candeub 398–405. Telegraphs, for example, because they “resemble[d] railroad companies and other common carriers,” were “bound to serve all customers alike, without discrimination.” Primrose v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 154 U. S. 1, 14 (1894). In exchange for regulating transportation and communication industries, governments—both State and Federal—

have sometimes given common carriers special government favors. Candeub 402–407. For example, governments have

tied restrictions on a carrier’s ability to reject clients to “immunity from certain types of suits”3 or to regulations that

make it more difficult for other companies to compete with the carrier (such as franchise licenses). Ibid. By giving these companies special privileges, governments place them into a category distinct from other companies and closer to some functions, like the postal service, that the State has traditionally undertaken. Second, governments have limited a company’s right to exclude when that company is a public accommodation.

This concept—related to common-carrier law—applies to companies that hold themselves out to the public but do not

“carry” freight, passengers, or communications. See, e.g., Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 41–43 (1883) (Harlan, J.,

dissenting) (discussing places of public amusement). It also applies regardless of the company’s market power. See,

e.g., 78 Stat. 243, 42 U. S. C. §2000a(a).

Thomas went on to say that there is a strong case for lawmakers in Congress to impose restrictions on the ability of social media platforms to censor their users.

The similarities between some digital platforms and common carriers or places of public accommodation may give legislators strong arguments for similarly regulating digital platforms The Second Circuit feared that then-President Trump cut off speech by using the features that Twitter made available to him,” wrote Thomas. “But if the aim is to ensure that speech is not smothered, then the more glaring concern must perforce be the dominant digital platforms themselves. As Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms.

Thomas made several references to the work of law professor Adam Candeub, an expert on antitrust, free speech, and the internet who has worked on free speech cases against Twitter.

Candeub was also a senior official in the Trump administration, working on rulemaking changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the law that tech companies rely on to censor their users without liability.

In a comment to Breitbart News, Candeub welcomed Thomas’ opinions.

“Justice Thomas’s statement is an encouraging sign that the federal judiciary–as well as legislatures–will look carefully at the legal status of social media,” said Candeub. “Never in our history has our country handed over to private firms control over dominant communications networks without requiring obligations to serve all citizens.”

346,Biden Issues Executive Controls to Fight Gun Crime 'Epidemic' in USA,"President Joe Biden put forward executive gun controls Thursday to fight what he called “an epidemic” of gun crime across the country.

CNN quoted Biden saying, “Gun violence in this country is an epidemic.” He went so far as to describe it as “an international embarrassment.”

The president then put forward executive actions which included initiatives in four areas Breitbart News highlighted on Wednesday. Those were new restrictions on “ghost guns,” a push for red flag laws, recategorization of AR-15 pistols, and DOJ-led research into gun trafficking.

As for red flag laws, Biden said, “We know red flag laws can stop mass shooters before they can act out their violent plans.” He then directed the Justice Department to publish model red flag legislation that states can adopt.

He did not mention Colorado has had a red flag law since January 1, 2020, but it did nothing to hinder, much less prevent, the March 22, 2021, Boulder attack.

Biden also addressed AR-pistols with stabilizer braces, saying, “We want to treat pistols, modified with stabilizing braces, with the seriousness they deserve.” He suggested having a stabilizing brace on a pistol “makes that pistol a hell of lot more accurate” and “more lethal.”

He added, “Modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should be subject to the National Firearms Act.”

As Breitbart News noted, if the purchase of AR-pistols is categorized as the purchase of a “short-barreled rifle” the process of buying the firearm could require being fingerprinted and photographed, as well as undergoing a background check, registering the firearm with the ATF, paying the federal government a $200 tax (on top of the price of the firearm), and waiting nine to ten months for the whole purchasing process to be completed.

That is the standard process for other short barrel rifles and firearms along with accessories under the purview of the National Firearms Act.

The president pushed for an annual report on gun trafficking too, saying: “Today with online sales, and ‘ghost guns,’ times and trafficking methods have changed. We have to adjust. We also have to ask the Justice Department to release a new annual report, this report will better help policy makers address firearm trafficking as it is today, now what it was yesterday.”

Biden then pointed to the cost tied to gun crime seen in large cities across America, particularly in minority communities. He said, “Gun violence is estimated to cost the nation $280 billion a year.”

He suggested Americans could have gun control instead, and claimed such control comes “at a fraction of the cost.”

Missy Owens no longer works for the company, leaving in November of 2020 before Coca-Cola partnered with Nike in additional opposition against the “Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act” that seeks to ban “all imports from Xinjiang unless a company can clearly prove that the products were not made by slaves,” Breitbart’s Frances Martel reported on the bill.

As the director, Owens was not “directly involved” in lobbying against the bill. However, “A different lobbying group, Sidley Austin LLP, was reported as lobbying for the company against the bill from the beginning of last year to the end of March 2020. The company’s employees gave the Biden campaign over $450,000 during the 2020 cycle,” Coca-Cola told Fox News.

Meanwhile, Coca-Cola, maintaining the “third-largest market by volume” with Communist China and has invested “$4 billion locally for future growth from 2015 to 2017,” is painting a colored history of ignoring human rights issues.

The State of Georgia passed election integrity legislation on March 31, which Coca-Cola’s CEO called “unacceptable” and “based on a lie,” joining 200 other “woke” companies who reject voter ID laws that ensure democratic elections; an idea the Communist Party of China knows little about.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) bashed those woke multinational corporations who “are too eager to make their voices heard on the woke issues of the day in the United States, but remain stunningly silent” or “complicit, in real, ongoing atrocities in countries like China,” Rubio criticized.",1
348,"Science?: Some MLB Stadiums Fully Open, Others Still Limited","With a focus on Major League Baseball’s All-Star Game and the season well underway, the fact that some stadiums are at greater fan capacity while others are still heavily restricted naturally raises questions.

MLB announced that the 2021 season would begin with fans returning to the stands despite some fears over the continuing coronavirus pandemic. Though, what form that return is taking differs from team to team and stadium to stadium. Ahead of the season, the league told each team that they should craft their at-home attendance policies by first taking local government requirements as their guide.

The league’s hands-off policy has ended up with very different attendance rules for each team this season. And according to the Los Angeles Times, the number of fans allowed in the stadiums is all over the place.

For instance, the Arizona Diamondbacks was set to allow 25 percent of Chase Field’s capacity as the season started. On the other hand, the Colorado Rockies opened at 42.6 percent capacity. Meanwhile, the Marlins opened at 25 percent.

Twenty percent seems to be a favorite for several teams, including the New York Mets, the Phillies, and Los Angeles Dodgers, who were only authorized to sell 20 percent of its tickets.

The rest of the National League is similarly disparate.

In California, the Padres are at 20 percent capacity and the Giants at 33 percent. Chicago’s Cubs also opened at 20 percent, but the Milwaukee Brewers allow 25 percent of its stadium to fill with fans just to the north. Down south of the Cubs’ and Brewers’ stomping grounds, the Cincinnati Reds opened at 30 percent capacity.

Many other stadiums opened to a much higher number of fans. In Pittsburgh, the Pirates decided to allow 50 percent capacity. The Cardinals went for a somewhat lower 32 percent, while the Braves went to 33 percent.

Finally, for the National League, the Washington Nationals opened to a tiny 12 percent of its stadium’s capacity.

Twenty percent capacity seems to be a big favorite for the American League. The teams that opened at 20 percent comprise the bulk of the league. Teams at 20 percent stadium capacity include the Los Angeles Angels, the Oakland As, the Mariners, the White Sox, the Detroit Tigers, the New York Yankees,

But twenty percent is not the bottom. Other American League teams opened at lower numbers. The Toronto Blue Jays opened at 15 percent, while the Red Sox opened at a mere 12 percent.

The Texas Rangers opened up 100 percent, the Houston Astros were a bit more cautious, opening at 25 percent capacity.

From there, the numbers bounce around a bit more.

All these disparities tend to claim that these cities and states are each “following the science” to be suspect. If they follow the science, how could the requirements often differ from one stadium to the next?

As Breitbart Sports reported Thursday:

Health officials accused Super Bowl 55 of being a super-spreading event in the making when QB Tom Brady led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a lopsided win over the Kansas City Chiefs in February. Not only were health officials in Florida worried, officials on the other side of the country in California even banned Super Bowl parties for fear of spreading the virus. But despite the loud proclamations, it turned out that there was no appreciable rise in coronavirus cases either in Florida, where the game was held or elsewhere as fans went home. With another example of undue warnings about super spreading events, officials have constantly demanded that states keep youth sports shuttered to prevent the virus’s spread. But a large study in Wisconsin showed that very few kids, coaches, or parents got the virus when Wisconsin restarted its youth sports despite the panic.

“Experts” have been proven wrong at the collegiate level as well:

Notre Dame was also accused of sponsoring a super spreader event when students stormed the football field to celebrate the school’s upset win over Clemson last November. But no outbreak of the virus was reported in the months after the game. Like Notre Dame, Alabama fans also faced criticism for swarming onto the field in January after the Crimson Tide won its national championship. Again, no reports of a rise in virus cases were found in the months after the big game.

So, despite all the concerns, there is no evidence that large crowds have ever created coronavirus-spreading events. Yet, that fact doesn’t stop the media from asking the “experts” for their opinions.

350,Back in Business: WrestleMania Ready to Rumble with Fans,"His time due as the next face of WWE, Drew McIntyre imagined what his crowning achievement would look like in the build toward last year’s WrestleMania in his American hometown of Tampa, Florida.

“I beat ‘The Beast’ Brock Lesnar, I raise the title, I jump into the crowd,” he said.

He defeated Lesnar, yes.

Then, silence. No pyrotechnics, no fans — digital, cardboard or packed in seats — no members of his family sitting ringside to celebrate with the Scottish-born star.

The mania was muted.

Banished from the scheduled site at Raymond James Stadium, WWE ran its signature event inside an empty training facility in Florida.

“The pandemic hits. I get a little angry, disappointed, frustrated when I found out it was going to be in the performance center,” McIntyre said.

A year later, McIntyre gets a chance to do it again.

Let’s wrestle two!

WWE is set to welcome back fans for the first time in more than a year when 25,000 of the catchphrase-yelling, replica championship belt-wearing, sign-holding diehards are expected on both Saturday and Sunday nights at Raymond James Stadium for WrestleMania.

“There’s nothing like seeing the fans in person and getting a redo in Raymond James Stadium,” McIntyre said. “They’re going to blow the roof off, if there’s even a roof.”

The company built on the purported 24-inch pythons of Hulk Hogan navigated a pandemic year with live shows held in its ThunderDome setup, where fans appeared on digital video boards and artificial crowd noise was pumped into the stadium for every match. Even without nonstop touring, WWE business has never been better: Already locked into long-term, billion-dollar TV deals with Fox and USA, WWE shifted its standalone streaming service to NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service for, yes, another billion-dollar contract.

That’s a truckload of fabulous moolah for a company whose ratings cratered during the pandemic, with just 1.701 million viewers watching the Mania go-home show Monday night on USA.

Often criticized for a heavy reliance on past stars in its marquee events, WWE has John Cena, Lesnar, Triple H, The Undertaker and Bill Goldberg sitting this one out. Becky Lynch and Ronda Rousey — the first female wrestlers to headline a WrestleMania main event, in 2019 — are at home. Bayley and Charlotte Flair aren’t advertised. The card, of course, in wrestling is always subject to change.

McIntyre is back in the main event when he takes on WWE champion Bobby Lashley on Saturday. Roman Reigns defends the Universal championship in a triple-threat match against Edge and Daniel Bryan in Sunday’s big match.

Lashley headlines WrestleMania 37 after serving as Donald Trump’s hand-picked representative for a “Battle of the Billionaires” match against Umaga and his rep, WWE CEO Vince McMahon, in 2007. The 44-year-old Lashley enters WrestleMania in the rarified air of Black champions in an industry that historically cast minorities as stereotypical performers. This year, people of color fill the card, with Lashley, The New Day’s Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods, and the Smackdown women’s championship match pitting champion Sasha Banks vs. Bianca Belair among the handful of matches with representation.

“Of course, everybody right now is saying there’s a lot of African-American or Black people in these big, high-profile matches and that’s understandable because it wasn’t something that was very prevalent before,” Lashley said. “Now, since you see it more, if it happens next year it won’t be one of those things where people are asking me the question because it’s just going to be natural. We have everybody. Everybody can be represented in WrestleMania.”

The list of celebrities — kicked off at the first WrestleMania in 1985 when Mr. T competed in the main event — includes YouTuber Logan Paul, rapper Wale and singers Ashland Craft and Grammy-winner Bebe Rexha. Those entertainers aren’t pulling up the wrestling boots and looking for a fight. But Bad Bunny, the 27-year-old Puerto Rican rapper-singer who won a Grammy and performed on “Saturday Night Live” this year, is set for a tag-team match with his partner Damian Priest against The Miz and John Morrison.

“As much work as he puts into his music career, and his entertainment career, he’s putting all that into his WWE appearances,” The Miz said. “A lot of celebrities don’t take the time to learn the art of professional wrestling. It’s not that they don’t have the respect. They don’t have the knowledge. They’re so busy in everything else that they’re doing.”

The Miz missed WrestleMania last year because of COVID-19 protocols and McIntyre was sidelined this year when he tested positive. WWE is seating fans this weekend in pods and, unlike past WrestleManias that sold out football stadiums in record times, seats were still available Friday on Ticketmaster’s website for the event co-hosted by Hogan and Titus O’Neil.

Wrestling fans are ready, to cheer, boo, pop their eyes at WrestleMania moments and each unpredictable finish after a year on the sidelines. Maybe McIntyre will get to raise a championship belt in front of crazed fans, after all.

“The fact we get Round Two,” McIntyre said, “it’s pretty incredible.”",1
352,Poll: 67% Agree MLB’s All-Star Move Was Driven by ‘Politics and Publicity’,"A recent Daily Wire poll released Wednesday found an overwhelming majority agreed Major League Baseball’s (MLB) relocation from Atlanta was driven by “politics and publicity.”

The recent poll found 67 percent agreed Major League Baseball’s (MLB) relocation from Atlanta was driven by “politics and publicity.” In comparison, 33 percent said it was driven by a “genuine concern for voters in Georgia.”

Other key findings of the poll found 64 percent of Americans were “less likely to support companies and organizations that insert themselves into political issues and debates.” Also finding that 70 percent of all respondents to the survey agree with the statement: “Corporations and sports teams should generally stay out of politics.”

Among the voters who are familiar with the Georgia voting law, the survey found, 52 percent support the Georgia voter integrity bill. In addition, 71 percent of respondents said they were “more supportive” of the law after hearing what was in the bill.

The survey also included findings showing an overwhelming majority (78 percent) of the survey. SurveyMonkey took from a sample of majority Democrats, MLB fans, non-white Americans, and all age groups, supporting Georgia’s laws requiring voter IDs for absentee voting.

Sixty-five percent of respondents, including 62 percent non-white Americans, favor Georgia’s new policy allowing election offices to only send ballot request forms to voters who have requested them.

The poll found that 55 percent of Americans were initially supportive of MLB’s decision to move the All-Star Game out of Atlanta. Eventually, the poll found over half (54 percent) of the surveyed Americans said they became “less supportive” of the league’s action after learning what the new Georgia election law actually contains.

The Daily Wire hired SurveyMonkey, which interviewed 1,026 Americans over 18. The sample consisted of 31 percent Republican, 34 percent Democrat, and 35 percent Independent. The Daily Wire also emphasized the sample of Americans and were not subscribers to their membership.

The former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent blasted current Commissioner Rob Manfred in a Wall Street Journal op-ed for pulling the league’s All-Star Game out of Georgia, calling it a “serious mistake.”",1
353,Lance Armstrong's Son Accused of Sexually Assaulting a 16-Year-Old Girl,"Lance Armstrong’s oldest son has been accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl in 2018, an allegation that Armstrong’s legal representation denies.

Luke Armstrong, now 21, is accused of driving the girl to his father’s home in 2018 and assaulting her there. Luke Armstrong was 18 at the time, according to the arrest affidavit.

According to the New York Post:

His accuser reported the incident to police last November, alleging the assault happened after a party when Luke picked her up because she had been drinking, the report said. She claimed not to remember the drive, but woke up as Luke was allegedly sexually assaulting her on a couch at his dad’s home. Luke allegedly admitted to having sex with his accuser in a phone call with her last December, the affidavit says.

However, Armstrong lawyer Randy Leavitt claims that the sexual relationship was consensual and strongly denies any assault.

“What occurred three years ago in high school was not a crime and was not a sexual assault,” Leavitt explained to KXAN news. “It was a consensual relationship then and continued consensually between two young people with both ultimately going their separate ways.

“It wasn’t a one-time thing,” Leavitt said. “They had something of a relationship going on for a brief period of time.”

According to the affidavit, several people who knew the alleged victim told the Austin Police Department that the girl indicated she had been assaulted. However, the affidavit also discloses that at least one person told the police that the sexual relationship was consensual.

Luke Armstrong was arrested Tuesday and released on bond, according to KXAN. He was charged with sexual assault of a child, a second-degree felony.",1
354,"Report: Former NFL Player Kills 5 in South Carolina, then Himself","COLUMBIA, S.C. — The gunman who killed five people including a prominent doctor in South Carolina was former NFL pro Phillip Adams, who killed himself early Thursday, according to a source who was briefed on the investigation.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly, said Adams’ parents live near the doctor’s home in Rock Hill, and that he had been treated by the doctor. The source said Phillips killed himself after midnight with a .45 caliber weapon.

The York County Sheriff’s Office said they had searched for hours before finding the suspect in a nearby home.

The York County coroner’s office said Dr. Robert Lesslie, 70, and his wife, Barbara Lesslie, 69, were pronounced dead at the scene along with grandchildren Adah Lesslie, 9, and Noah Lesslie, 5.

A man who had been working at the home, James Lewis, 38, from Gaston, was found shot to death outside, and a sixth person was hospitalized with “serious gunshot wounds,” York County Sheriff’s Office’s spokesperson Trent Faris said.

Faris said deputies were called around 4:45 p.m. Wednesday to the Lesslies’ home in the Rock Hill area, and spent hours searching for the suspect before finding him in a nearby home.

“We have found the person we believe is responsible and we are with him at this time and that’s all I can say about the suspect,” Faris said.

The investigation is ongoing, he said.",1
355,County Officials Warn that Rangers Games Could Lead to COVID Surge,"Tarrant County’s top health officials are claiming without evidence that large crowds for Texas Rangers games may turn into a coronavirus super spreading event.

“We need to be sensible about how we bring back normal. There are times when you have to be cautious, and right now is the time to be cautious,” said Vinny Taneja, the county’s public health director, according to the Star-Telegram.

The Rangers announced that 38,238 fans turned out at Globe Life field on Monday, a number representing a sell-out crowd and the largest number the Rangers have had in more than a year, not to mention the largest group of fans for a pro baseball game since the pandemic was declared.

But Taneja bemoaned the stadium full of Rangers fans for ignoring social distancing and warnings to avoid large crowds.

Taneja claimed it was “hard” for him to see the huge crowd of baseball fans, adding, “COVID is still active; the flu is still active. Are we really wanting to ask for trouble?”

Still, the numbers are falling in Texas. Per the Star-Telegram: “Tarrant County has been on a downward trend in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations, and positivity rate since the end of January. The county has gone from reporting almost 20,000 cases a week to about 1,000 to 3,000 in recent weeks.”

Taneja is not on solid ground with his disgust over the Rangers game. Similar doomsaying of “super spreader events” was leveled at a growing number of significant public events over the last year.

Health officials accused Super Bowl 55 of being a super-spreading event in the making when QB Tom Brady led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a lopsided win over the Kansas City Chiefs in February. Not only were health officials in Florida worried, officials on the other side of the country in California even banned Super Bowl parties for fear of spreading the virus.

O’Neal said that paying off the ring is an example of the acts of kindness he tries to do every day.

“I’m into making people happy, so whenever I leave the house, I just try and do a good deed. I didn’t mean for that to get out. That’s not why I do it. .. The guy just came in; he was a young kid, hardworking guy.”

357,Report: MLB Commish Pulled All-Star Game After Talking to Stacey Abrams,"According to a report from Fox Business Network’s Charles Gasparino, sources inside Major League Baseball claim that Commissioner Rob Manfred “blindsided” MLB owners with “at least” the “timing” of his decision to pull the All-Star Game from Atlanta. Moreover, Gasparino’s report claims that Manfred spoke with defeated 2018 Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams before he decided to move the game.

Gasparino hit Twitter on Wednesday to deliver the report:

SCOOP: @MLB sources say owners were blindsided at least by the timing of @RobManfred's decision to pull the All-Star game from Atlanta. Also said his decision came after speaking w @staceyabrams, which is odd since she has now said she's against the boycott. Story developing — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) April 7, 2021

The report is puzzling since Abrams has consistently and publicly claimed that she opposed the game being taken away from Atlanta. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp recently slammed Abrams as the “biggest flip-flopper since John Kerry” for her sudden plea for people not to boycott Georgia.

Gasparino had several more scoop tweets for Wednesday, too.

The FBN reporter also said that he has heard that MLB executives now fear a major backlash over Manfred’s decision to punish Georgia. Gasparino also reports that the league is desperately backtracking to figure out ways to make sure minorities in Atlanta are not financially harmed by moving the All-Star Game to Colorado.

Also hearing @MLB working on a possible ""solution"" to after criticism that moving the All Star game out of Atl will be devastating to minority businesses will address that as well now @FoxBusiness https://t.co/UhQBoVn4d7 — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) April 7, 2021

Gasparino had one last thought on Stacy Abrams ham-handed comments over the All-Star Game:

What doesnt add up about @staceyabrams criticism of moving All-Star game out of Atlanta: She was initially partnering w @KingJames organization @morethanavote to oppose GA voter law. @morethanavote supports MLB decision to move out of Atl. Has she relayed her concerns to LeBron? — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) April 7, 2021

Still, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution’s Greg Bluestein, some insiders say that Abrams did ask MLB not to move the All-Star game:

I’m told that @staceyabrams spoke to an @MLB senior adviser and “strongly” urged the league to keep the All-Star game in Atlanta before the decision to yank the event. She also argued against a boycott before MLB’s move in a @USATODAY op-ed and @AJC interview last week. #gapol — Greg Bluestein (@bluestein) April 7, 2021

358,Georgia House Democrats Stay Silent on MLB’s Move Out of Georgia,"Georgia House Democrats, Rep. Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux have both stayed silent on Major League Baseball’s (MLB) decision to relocate the All-Star Game out of Georgia.

The Democrats, who both hold Congressional seats in neighboring Georgia districts, have stayed quiet regarding the MLB’s All-Star Game moved out of the Peach State. MLB confirmed Monday night the game is relocated to Denver, Colorado.

The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) released a statement Wednesday regarding the Democrat’s decision to stay quiet on a major topic from their own state, asking if they support the decision, which will lose millions of dollars in revenue.

Breitbart News independently reached out to McBath and Bourdeaux’s offices to ask them if they support the MLB’s decision to move the All-Star game from Georgia, which would be hurting local workers and costing the state $100 million. Neither office responded to the inquiry by the time this article was published.

The NRCC in February released a list of 47 “offensive opportunities,” which included 29 Battleground Democrats. The Battleground Districts are where “President Biden lost the district or where the 2020 presidential or congressional margin was within 5 percent.” Both of the Georgia Democrats have been on the list since the beginning.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) was on Fox Business Network’s show Kudlow Tuesday night to talk about the Democrat’s spread of disinformation about the voter integrity bill, which in turn caused the MLB to move the All-Star game.

Kemp said on Kudlow:

[T]his action is screwing the little guy. The people that would have profited from the baseball game being here that got pubs and restaurants around the stadium, the Uber drivers, and that whole economy where that dollar turns, and now, they’re taking something away from a metro Atlanta population in metro area population that’s 51% African American and taking it to Denver where it’s 9 or 10%. I mean, none of this makes any sense is why people are so mad.

Instead of taking a stand on the business being lost from moving the game, McBath took to Twitter to compare the voter integrity laws to Jim Crow laws.

This legislation is modern Jim Crow, full stop. https://t.co/FEOFdJYMvx — Lucy McBath (@lucymcbath) March 26, 2021

Bourdeaux also, instead of taking a stand on the business being lost from moving the game, took a similar stand to help spread similar opinions about the voter integrity laws, saying it would be a lot more challenging to win a seat now because of the bill being passed into law by the Georgia legislature.

359,"JCN Pens Letter to MLB, Demands All Star Game Return to Georgia","The Job Creators Network (JCN) sent a letter to the Major League Baseball (MLB) commissioner Wednesday “criticizing his decision to move the upcoming All Star game from Atlanta to Denver.”

The letter, which was sent from JCN president and CEO Alfredo Ortiz and addressed to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred, called out the organization’s decision to cost Georgia businesses $100 million, which JCN concludes “would have helped the small business community recover from the pandemic.”

“Small businesses in Georgia are hurting and the MLB commissioner pulled a multi-million rug out from underneath them,” Ortiz said in a statement. “Manfred justifies his decision by echoing false claims made by others who argue Georgia’s new election law is simply Jim Crow 2.0. That rationale couldn’t be further from reality.”

Ortiz also stated that “Georgia election rules make it easy to vote and hard to cheat.”

“In contrast to the incendiary rhetoric and accusations of racism from politicians and activists, these rules simply bring Georgia’s voting standards in line with other states’, including Colorado’s,” Ortiz continued.

Ortiz also called on Manfred and the MLB to reverse their decision in his statement, warning that if they do not, small businesses will “pay the price.”

“The commissioner should flip the switch on his selective outrage and allow the All Star game to return to Atlanta where it belongs, or local small businesses will pay the price,” Ortiz said.

In the letter, Ortiz said for some “small businesses that have disproportionately suffered through government-imposed pandemic lockdowns over the past year, the financial loss is a punch to the gut and will have an outsized impact on minority-owned businesses. … We demand that you reverse the decision.”

In addition, Ortiz wrote:",1
360,Jen Psaki: The United States Has ‘Not Discussed’ Boycott of China 2022 Olympics,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday that President Joe Biden’s administration had not discussed boycotting the 2022 Winter Olympics in China.

“We have not discussed and are not discussing any joint boycott with allies and partners,” Psaki said during the White House press briefing when asked about the Olympics.

China’s government warned against the idea, threatening a “robust Chinese response” if the United States decided to boycott the Olympics.

“The politicization of sports will damage the spirit of the Olympic Charter and the interests of athletes from all countries,” government spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said. “The international community including the U.S. Olympic Committee will not accept it.”

State Department spokesman Ned Price sparked speculation of the United States’ role in the Olympics on Tuesday when he stated the United States would continue reviewing the upcoming games in China.

“Part of our review of those Olympics and our thinking will involve close consultations with partners and allies around the world,” Price said in a briefing with reporters.

Psaki told reporters the idea of a boycott was not currently on the table.

“[T]here’s no discussion underway of a change in our plans regarding the Beijing Olympics from the United States point of view,” she said.",1
361,Police: Tiger's Crash Strictly a Result of Speeding 83 MPH in a 45 Zone,"The L.A. County Sheriff’s Department now says that the sole reason for Tiger Woods’ February 23 single-car crash was that he lost control after speeding 83 MPH in a 45 MPH zone.

The determination was made by looking at the crash scene and reviewing the black box data from Woods’ automobile, investigators say. Officials also noted that Tiger waived his right to privacy over the police investigation into the crash and authorized the accident report’s public release, TMZ said.

Insiders told TMZ that the five-time Masters’ winner was driving too fast and lost control ahead of the accident. Officials have no speculation for why he was driving at such an excessive speed.

Previous reports claimed that the crash scene showed that the 45-year-old Woods never applied the brakes before the impact that so suddenly stopped his vehicle.

According to testimony from a bystander who was first on the scene, Woods was found unconscious immediately after the wreck.

But first responders reported that the golf great was conscious and responsive when they arrived at the scene. The 45-year-old player was also conscious and alert when he was pulled from the wrecked auto. However, Woods is said to have no memory of the accident.

TMZ also noted that insiders told them that Woods seems to have accelerated just before the crackup.

Curiously, officials did not subpoena Woods’ cell phone records to determine if he was talking or even texting at the time of the wreck.

Still, in March, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva insisted that Woods was afforded no special treatment during the investigation but added no charges were expected to be filed against the player.

Woods was released from the hospital on March 16 after undergoing surgery on both his legs to repair the severe injuries suffered in the crash.

Woods is reportedly convalescing in Florida.

362,Kennedy: MLB Decision ‘to Turn Baseball into a Blue Sport’ Makes Me ‘Want to Heave’,"Wednesday on Fox News Channel’s “The Faulkner Focus,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) ripped Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred for his decision to quickly revoke the All-Star Game from Atlanta over Georgia’s recently passed election law.

Kennedy said the league’s decision “to turn baseball into a blue sport” makes him “want to heave.” He then called on Manfred to “buy a spine” and go on air to explain his reasoning for why he thinks the law intended to shore up election integrity is “racist.”

“Harris … I don’t hate anybody, and I try to see grace wherever I can find it, but the decision by Mr. Rob Manfred, the commissioner of Major League Baseball, to turn baseball into a blue sport — it just really makes me want to heave,” Kennedy told host Harris Faulkner. “You know, I mean … whether you agree or disagree with the Georgia law, I don’t think any of us — I know I don’t — want to have to think about politics when we watch baseball.”

“[W]hat disturbs me equally about Mr. Manfred’s decision is he hasn’t explained it,” he continued. “He hasn’t explained why he thinks that Georgia’s law, which I think was an honest effort toward election integrity, is racist. Now, Mr. Manfred, he looks like a smart guy. He went to Cornell, he graduated from Harvard Law School, he probably washed his hands before it was cool. I think if he is going to do this to Major League Baseball, he owes an explanation.”

363,Nike Suspends Sponsorship Deal with Deshaun Watson,"Nike has suspended its sponsorship deal with Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson after nearly two dozen allegations of sexual misconduct have been made against the player.

The move comes one day after Watson’s first accuser, Ashley Solis, also became the first to make a public appearance accusing the star player of sexual misconduct.

“We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and have suspended Deshaun Watson. We will continue to closely monitor the situation,” Nike said in its statement.

In all, 22 women have accused Watson of varying degrees of sexual assault and/or inappropriate behavior.

According to ESPN:

Watson’s brand partnerships also include Rolex, Beats by Dre and local partnerships with H-E-B and Reliant Energy. He also joined Lefty’s, a cheesesteak franchise, opening a restaurant in Houston near NRG Stadium in 2020. The NFL has launched an investigation into Watson under its personal conduct policy, and NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy on Tuesday called the allegations against the quarterback ‘deeply disturbing.’ The Houston Police Department also has an open investigation into Watson, without specifying what he has been accused of.

Rusty Hardin, who represents Watson, has steadfastly maintained his client’s innocence and countered that the lawyers representing Solis had “sought $100,000 in hush money on behalf of Ms. Solis to quietly settle the allegations the month before he filed the first lawsuit.”

Last week, Hardin disclosed the statements of 18 female massage therapists who said they had worked with Watson and that he had “never made them feel uncomfortable or demanded anything outside the scope of a professional massage.”

On Tuesday, however, Tony Buzbee, who is representing the plaintiffs, said that one of the 18 women who made those statements had also sent him a direct message referencing Watson saying that she had stopped working with the star quarterback because she had been “hearing too much stuff about him messing with other people.”

Watson, who had been seeking a trade before the slew of allegations against him became public, stands an excellent chance of being placed on the NFL Commissioner’s exempt list. A temporary status that would keep Watson off the Active List pending the results of an investigation.

The NFL has not yet said what action they will take.",1
364,Scarborough: Biden ‘Jumped the Gun’ Calling to Move ASG from GA,"MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough on Wednesday reacted to President Joe Biden changing his tune on moving the Masters golf tournament out of Georgia a week after calling for Major League Baseball to move its All-Star Game out of the state. The call, which was ultimately heeded by MLB, came in response to Georgia’s new election law.

After MSNBC’s Willie Geist pointed out that it is “impossible to square” Biden’s argument, Scarborough suggested the league and others, including the president, “jumped the gun” before actually reading Georgia’s law and comparing it to other states’ election laws.

“To listen to the president speaking right there, it’s impossible to square his argument,” Geist said. “One week ago, he was calling for the All-Star game to be moved out of Atlanta, and then shortly thereafter, it was. Now, he’s expressing concern about the idea of moving the Masters because of the impact it might have on working people in and around the Masters.”

“[D]oesn’t it seem that a lot of people jumped the gun, a lot of people moved this All-Star Game, talked about supporting moving of the All-Star game — and, yes, I do believe Major League Baseball moved the All-Star Game before actually either reading the bill or understanding how the bill lined up with New Jersey laws, with New York laws, with laws all across the nation,” Scarborough wondered. “And again, please, please, don’t shoot me. … But I understand the bad faith that was shown in Georgia. I understand the bad faith that was shown by Georgia legislators, but this is going to be hard to unwind. And it’s going to be hard to unwind because, again, there is that bad faith there, but when you line this bill up with what the laws were before the pandemic and what the laws are in states like New York, it is not Jim Crow 2.0.”

He continued, “The question is, did that warrant such a massive move? Or should they have listened to Stacey Abrams, should they listen to John Ossoff, should they listen to Raphael Warnock, who said keep the All-Star Game here, please, but let’s use this as a learning experience and let’s use this to draw America’s attention to the bad parts of this voting law.”

365,Former MLB Commish: Rob Manfred Made a ‘Serious Mistake’ by Pulling Out of Georgia,"Former Major League Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent blasted current Commissioner Rob Manfred for making a “serious mistake” in pulling the league’s All-Star Game out of Georgia.

Vincent, who served as MLB commissioner from September of 1989 to September of 1992, let fly with his criticisms of Manfred in a Tuesday op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. In the piece, Vincent accuses Manfred of having made a “serious mistake” by pulling the All-Star Game (ASG) from Atlanta. Specifically, he charges that Manfred should have first protested the “substance of the law” before acting out of “desperation” by enforcing a boycott.

Vincent also highlighted the disproportionate harm such boycotts have on minority communities. In addition to citing the hypocrisy of baseball pulling a special event from Georgia, supposedly because of a “racist” law, and then doing business with a gross human rights abuser in China. The former commissioner also questioned Manfred’s understanding of the Georgia law by harkening back to the incorrect and incendiary conclusions so many arrived at during the 2006 Duke lacrosse controversy.

Vincent wrote:

The talk shows and editorial pages are full of questions. What is the basis for acting so forcefully against Georgia? If Georgia is racist, how can baseball talk of doing business with China? Mr. Manfred failed to spell out specific criticisms of Georgia’s voting law. Now he’s put himself in the awkward position of having to defend Colorado’s voting laws. During my time as commissioner, I learned that the American people view baseball as a public trust. They want the game to stand for the best and noblest of our national virtues. They see baseball as the repository of their dreams, even as they root for their favorite teams. They don’t want, and won’t accept, anything that separates them from the game’s history and leadership. Major League Baseball can’t become a weapon in the culture wars, a hostage for one political party or ideology. It can’t be only for the rich or the poor, nor can it only be for one race, as it was until 1947. Baseball must always stand above politics and its dark elements of corruption, greed and sordid selfishness. It can’t go wrong by standing for national greatness. The situation calls to mind the 2006 Duke lacrosse case, when many erred—like Mr. Manfred has here—by leaping to a conclusion based on assumptions rather than carefully considered facts. I’ve done the same thing, to my regret. Much rides on Mr. Manfred’s shoulders so he must be prudent. Perhaps he now sees how complicated these issues can become. I wish him well.

Manfred decided to pull the game out of Atlanta due to the belief that the state’s recently passed voter reform measures represented an attack on the ability of many, specifically minorities, to vote. Those claims have been repeatedly debunked by Breitbart News and even, to varying degrees, by the Washington Post.

MLB has since relocated its ASG to Colorado. A state that requires voter ID and actually has fewer early voting days than Georgia.",1
366,"Pollak: In ‘Jim Crow’ Charge, Joe Biden Breaks ‘Healing’ Promise to Georgia Voters","President Joe Biden reiterated his claim Tuesday that Georgia and other states that are passing laws to discourage voter fraud are enacting “new Jim Crow laws” that “are just antithetical to who we are.”

In pursuing that outrageous, inflammatory claim — hearkening to the worst days of racial segregation — Joe Biden is betraying his promise on the 2020 campaign trail, and in his Inaugural Address, to heal a divided nation and to unite Americans in a common cause.

There is no basis whatsoever for the “Jim Crow” claim. The vast majority of Americans — including 73% of black Americans in a poll this week — favor the use of photo identification in voting.

Biden and the Democrats claim that the push for new laws is based on the “lie” that the 2020 election was stolen. But even if the 2020 result was entirely accurate, it lacked credibility to many Americans. The use of widespread vote-by-mail in many states that had never used it before, for example, created confusion on Election Night.

The fiasco with Major League Baseball proves the point.

Last week, Biden encouraged the league to move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta over the Georgia law, which actually expands voting in many ways. The league moved it to Denver, Colorado, a “whiter” city in a state where some voting laws are more restrictive than in Georgia.

The White House tried to claim that the president had not “dictated” the move, even as it tried to defend the league’s decision, and as Biden continued to cite “Jim Crow.”

The people hurt most directly by the loss of the All-Star Game are the residents of Atlanta, a majority-black city — one that was crucial to Biden’s election victory and to Democratic control of the Senate.

There is no better example of how Democrats have hurt black Americans while exploiting black voters and false claims of racism for political purposes.

Moreover, Biden’s stance is a direct betrayal of the promise he made to Georgia voters in the 2020 election.

Last October, while campaigning in Georgia, Biden devoted an entire speech to the idea of healing.

“I want to talk about how we’re going to heal our nation,” he told voters in Warm Springs. “I know this country, I know our people, and I know we can unite and heal this nation. Warm Springs is a good place to talk about hope and healing.”

America needed “a President who doesn’t divide us, but unites us,” he said. “A President who appeals not to the worst in us, but to the best. A President who cares less about his TV ratings and more about the American people. A President who looks not to settle scores, but to find solutions.”

Biden then warned: “Time and again, throughout our history, we’ve seen charlatans, the con men, the phony populists, who sought to play on our fears, appeal to our worst appetites, and pick at the oldest scabs we have for their own political gain.”

He invoked the Pope, and the Bible:

Pope Francis asked questions that anyone who seeks to lead this great nation should be able to answer. And my answer is this: I run to unite this nation and to heal this nation. I’ve said that from the beginning. It is badly necessary. The Bible tells us there’s a time to break down, and a time to build up, a time to heal. This is that time. God and history have called us to this moment, and to this mission. … And if we do so, we’ll once more become one nation under God, indivisible, a nation united, a nation strengthened, a nation healed. That is my goal. That is why I’m running. That is what we must do.

Later, in November, when the news networks declared that he had won the election, Biden declared: “This is the time to heal in America.” In his Inaugural Address, Biden spoke of “unity, not division,” and gave his “sacred oath” that he would write an “American story” of “love and of healing.”

In his abuse of “Jim Crow” to inflame the debate around voting, President Joe Biden is violating that oath, and breaking his explicit promises to voters in Georgia and beyond.

367,Kennedy: ‘A Special Kind of Stupid’ to Take Punitive Action Against Georgia for Voting Bill,"During Tuesday’s broadcast of FNC’s “The Story,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) slammed proponents of Major League Baseball’s decision to move its all-star game from Atlanta to Denver as a way to protest the Georgia Assembly’s efforts to strengthen the integrity of the state’s elections.

When asked to comment on a column written by USA Today’s Bob Nightengale, applauding MLB’s move and calling it the league’s “most important move since Jackie Robinson,” the Lousiana Republican reacted by calling such sentiments “a special kind of stupid.”

“Well, no disrespect, but that’s just a special kind of stupid,” he said. “This has nothing to do with Jackie Robinson. And it has nothing to do with race. Here’s what this is about: The Democrats want us to have an election month. The Republicans don’t. We want to go back to an Election Day. The Democrats oppose requiring an ID before you can vote. Republicans think we should in the interest of ballot security. Democrats want to make legal ballot harvesting. Republicans don’t. Ballot harvesting is where you pay somebody to go around and ask people to vote by mail, and you collect their ballots, and then you bring them to the ballot box.”

“I’m is not saying it’s inherently fraudulent, but fraud can occur. That’s all this dispute is about. The other point I’d make is that the Democrats want to pass Speaker Pelosi’s bill, HR1, which would federalize elections. Basically, what Speaker Pelosi’s bill would do is take everything that went wrong in the last presidential election and make it the law. None of this is about race. These Bolshevik woke leftists just obsess about race. They think about race. And the fact is, most Americans think about character. That’s what is so misplaced about all of this.”

“But why a large company, a CEO or a commissioner of a major sport would want to get involved in this and make conclusory allegations that everybody disagrees with them is a racist and not publicly defend their position? I don’t get it. I just don’t, Martha.”

368,U.S. Considering Joining Boycott of 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics,"According to the State Department, the United States is considering joining the boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic games as the Biden Administration is working to organize an international pushback on China.

A spokesperson from the State Department, Ned Price, said the United States has not decided about fully boycotting the games but is considering due to the growing concerns of China’s egregious human rights abuses.

This comes after the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in February, the Biden administration made no final decision on boycotting the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing over human rights abuses in China against the Uyghur Muslims of Xinjiang.

When reporters asked Price about the Biden administration plans ahead of the games, he said, “It [a joint boycott] is something that we certainly wish to discuss,” adding that “a coordinated approach will not only be in our interest but also in the interest of our allies and partners.”

The Winter Games are set to take place in Beijing between February 4th to 20th of next year.

“We don’t have any announcement regarding the Beijing Olympics,” Price said by tweet following his earlier statement. The “2022 remains a ways off, but we will continue to consult closely with allies and partners to define our common concerns and establish our shared approach to the PRC.”

As I said, we don’t have any announcement regarding the Beijing Olympics. 2022 remains a ways off, but we will continue to consult closely with allies and partners to define our common concerns and establish our shared approach to the PRC. — Ned Price (@StateDeptSpox) April 6, 2021

In early March, a human rights and advocacy organization for the ethnic group, World Uyghur Congress (WUC), asked the ethics commission chair for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to review the calls for the 2022 Winter Games not to be held in Beijing, China. They cited the allegations of “crimes against humanity” by China against Uyghurs.

Djaouida Siaci, a human rights lawyer, told Axios, “an Olympics boycott by the U.S. and its allies could help persuade the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into Beijing’s actions in Xinjiang.

This would be the first boycott of the Olympic games from the United States since 1980 in Moscow.

President Joe Biden spoke to Xi Jinping, the Chinese President, in February and expressed his approach to China would be different than his predecessor’s.

Biden said in a speech at the State Department, “We will confront China’s economic abuses,” and they are the “most serious competitor.”

“But we’re also ready to work with Beijing when it’s in America’s interest to do so. We’ll compete from a position of strength by building back better at home and working with our allies and partners,” Biden said.",1
371,Cuba Summons Biden Envoy over 'Flagrant' Human Rights Abuses in U.S.,"The Ministry of Foreign Relations (Minrex) of Cuba confirmed Monday that it had summoned the top American diplomat in the country, Embassy Chargé d’Affairs Timothy Zúñiga-Brown, to protest “flagrant and systematic violations of human rights in the United States.”

The accusation followed the publication of the U.S. State Department’s 2020 report on international human rights, which detailed the situation in every country on earth. Cuba’s profile in the 2020 report was typically unflattering given the consistent use of state violence to silence dissidents, the lack of free speech and assembly provisions, and widespread abuses of power by state security.

The Communist Party of Cuba’s protest followed repeated, public declarations of alleged human rights problems in the United States by the world’s most repressive regimes, primarily the Communist Party of China, which is currently overseeing the genocide of its Uyghur Muslim population in the nation’s west. At a meeting with President Joe Biden’s top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in Alaska last month, senior Communist Party official Yang Jiechi claimed the United States “is not qualified to speak to China from a position of strength” because of its own alleged wrongdoings.

Minrex made clear that it had lobbied the same protest against Washington in a diatribe delivered to Zúñiga-Brown.

Cuba’s director-general for American affairs, Carlos Fernández de Cossío, told the American diplomat that “flagrant and systematic violations of human rights in the United States and on the part of the government of that country are well-known and documented,” according to a Ministry press release. “This refers to racism, xenophobia, police brutality, torture of prisoners, extended imprisonment, the use of secret prisons, antisemitism, McCarthyism, and other forms of religious and ideological intolerance,” Minrex explained. The ministry did not cite any examples of instances of these alleged crimes — nor, of course, did it note that the Communist Party of Cuba faces documented allegations of committing nearly every single one.

Fernández de Cossío reportedly used the fact that Cuba — along with other human rights criminals such as China, Venezuela, and Pakistan — sit on the United Nations Human Rights Council as evidence that Cuba “enjoys international prestige in the realm of human rights.” He also allegedly dismissed the State Department’s documented evidence of human rights abuses on the island as “arbitrary and unilateral.”

Cuban Foreign Affairs Minister Bruno Rodríguez, Fernández de Cossío’s boss, took the nation’s campaign against the facts in the State Department report to social media, condemning the United States on Twitter.

“We reject the deceitful and politicized allegations about Cuba in the State Department report on human rights 2020,” Rodríguez wrote. “The opportunistic, arbitrary, and unilateral report lacks truth. We demand the government of the U.S. cease its campaign of discrediting and interference.”

Rechazamos las alegaciones engañosas y politizadas sobre #Cuba 🇺 del informe del Dpto de Estado sobre Derechos Humanos 2020. El informe, oportunista, arbitrario y unilateral, falta a la verdad. Instamos al gobierno de los EEUU a cesar su campaña de descrédito e injerencia. — Bruno Rodríguez P (@BrunoRguezP) April 5, 2021

The Communist Party appears to be attempting the summoning of the U.S. envoy as a victory against America, as the top story on Tuesday at Granma, the official state newspaper of the Communist Party, proclaimed, “Cuba’s Prestige in Human Rights Disqualifies U.S. Accusations.” The article repeats the claims in the Minrex press release about what the Cuban diplomat relayed to his American counterpart at Monday’s meeting.

The Cuban government notably did not refute the individual cases documented in the State Department’s human rights report, such as the death of dissident Sandi Fernandez Ortiz in police custody, the imprisonment of opposition leader José Daniel Ferrer, and the police raid of the headquarters of the San Isidro Movement in November, a dissident artist collective.

The State Department listed among Cuba’s greatest crimes “unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings, by the government; forced disappearance by the government; torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of political dissidents, detainees, and prisoners by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detentions; political prisoners; significant problems with the independence of the judiciary; and arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy.”

The State Department additionally accused the Communist Party of limiting religious freedom, denying citizens free and fair elections, “official corruption,” and human trafficking.

Cuba’s denial of human rights abuses arrives as the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), believed to be the country’s largest dssident organization, is engaging in an ongoing mass hunger strike demanding the end of the Castro regime. Ferrer, the group’s leader, and several family members are among the dozens who have spent 18 days on hunger strike as of Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, Ferrer used his Twitter account to warn that police had surrounded the headquarters of the organization in Santiago, eastern Cuba, making it impossible for the hunger strikers to communicate with locals in the neighborhood.

374,Poll: Over 80% of Venezuelans Don’t Trust Government Coronavirus Statistics,"A poll published this weekend by the firm Meganálisis found overwhelming national distrust in socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro’s handling of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in Venezuela, particularly regarding the number of cases and deaths the regime attributes to the virus.

Maduro’s regime, which has not ruled Venezuela legitimately since at least January 2019, has implemented a bizarre alternate lockdown method that requires Venezuelans to be under strict lockdown for seven days, followed by a week of no restrictions. Venezuelans have access to no vaccines at press time, though Maduro has promised mass vaccinations using Chinese, Cuban, and Russian products beginning this summer. Instead, Maduro has promoted the use of deadly ozone gas and “Carvativir,” an oil made of oregano and thyme, to fight the coronavirus. Maduro’s “cures” resulted in a month-long ban from publishing posts on Facebook that is currently still in vigor.

Nearly 82 percent of Venezuelans, surveyed from a pool representing all 24 states and regions of the country, answered negatively to the question “Do you believe and trust in the official statistics on coronavirus in Venezuela that the government of Nicolás Maduro announces on a daily basis?” Only 11 percent of respondents said they trusted the numbers, while 7.25 percent answered, “I don’t know.”

Meganálisis, which regularly organizes polls on attitudes towards the region and the general decline of the country under socialism, conducted its latest survey on March 29.

The last time Meganálisis asked the public for its trust rate in national statistics – October 18, 2020 – 72.56 percent of respondents said they did not trust the Maduro regime’s numbers. Only 12.35 percent said they believed the numbers. While these numbers reflect poorly on the Maduro regime’s ability to generate public trust, distrust appeared significantly higher in late March than in mid-October:

Meganálisis also asked respondents, “How has the Maduro government handled the vaccination process against coronavirus in Venezuela?” Again, an overwhelming majority said the regime had managed the issue poorly: 62.3 percent said “very poorly,” and another 22.8 percent said “poorly.” Only about six percent said the regime had handled the vaccine issue “well” or “very well.”

“These opinions are reinforced with the announcement and government propaganda regarding vaccines, which do not inspire confidence among citizens, as is the case of the Cuban, Chinese, and Russian vaccines,” Rubén Chirino Leañez, the vice president of Meganálisis, told Breitbart News.

Much of the distrust appears to be the product of a lack of access to proper health care, which has resulted in few Venezuelans receiving proper PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests when told they probably have a coronavirus infection. In October, Meganálisis found that 87 percent of those who live with someone whose doctor diagnosed them with the coronavirus never received a PCR test. A small minority of these did receive “rapid” tests that experts warn are often inaccurate.

The March poll found a modest increase in those diagnosed with the coronavirus without access to PCR tests: 89.4 percent of respondents. Another 89 percent said they treated those presumed coronavirus infections on their own, with no professional medical care.

Those diagnosed without a test do not form part of the nation’s official statistics:

Venezuela’s “vice president,” Delcy Rodríguez, is in charge of publishing coronavirus statistics on a daily basis and has been publishing increasingly alarming rates of infection in the past week. Venezuela experienced record-high numbers of the coronavirus back-to-back on successive days last week. On the day for which the latest statistics are currently available, Sunday, Venezuela documented 1,786 coronavirus cases, once again breaking the one-day record.

The Maduro regime has documented 166,123 cases of the Chinese coronavirus within its borders since the pandemic began, a number that has increased significantly in the past week, but international experts have continued to question this given how much smaller it is than for Venezuela’s neighbors, who – unlike socialist Venezuela – maintain functional hospital systems and well-stocked pharmacies. In Brazil, for example, the government has documented nearly 13 million cases of the Chinese coronavirus. In Colombia, that number is 2.4 million.

In remarks during his regular nationally televised broadcast on Sunday, Maduro insisted his regime “is two steps ahead of the pandemic,” comparing Venezuela’s infection rate to the United States’ rate. Venezuela is home to about 28 million people, 270 million fewer than the United States.

“They permanently demonize us but don’t do the same to Colombia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, the U.S., or Europe,” Maduro complained. “The New York Times, the Miami Herald are in a permanent campaign against Venezuela. They are incapable of recognizing advance, no achievement, not a single one of the successes we have had against the pandemic.”

Maduro insisted the current rapid rise in infection rates in Venezuela was entirely Brazil’s fault.

Maduro also announced the cancelation of a “free week” under his 7+7 program, extending the currently in-place lockdown, again allegedly because of the Brazilian government’s insufficient actions against the pandemic.

The socialist regime has also responded to an increase in cases by organizing “anti-imperialist” public events. Members of Maduro’s United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) published photos this weekend of socialists gathering to burn effigies of various individuals and concepts that Maduro has deemed enemies of the “Bolivarian Revolution,” such as Colombian President Iván Duque and “the imperialist blockade,” meaning international sanctions on the regime in response to its long record of human rights abuses:

375,EXCLUSIVE VIDEO: Mexican Cops Raid Human Smuggling Stash House in Border State,"Breitbart Texas obtained an exclusive video of the inside of a human smuggling stash house in a Mexican border state. Authorities in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, continue to witness a drastic increase in the number of migrants arriving in their region as they seek to reach the U.S. border.

The following short video captured the moment when state police forces in Nuevo Leon raid a stash house where cartel-connected human smugglers held 53 Central American migrants. The group includes 24 minors. The video shows the overcrowding and lack of basic necessities the migrants had to endure at the hands of their human smugglers. The raid took place in the Jardines neighborhood in the suburb of Escobedo. The town is located in the northern part of the Monterrey metropolitan area.

After getting the migrants out of the house, authorities learned that the group had been there for three days awaiting permission from an unnamed cartel to continue their journey north and cross into Texas. Authorities did not reveal if the migrants were headed to the Mexican border cities of Reynosa or Nuevo Laredo — two of the main human smuggling hubs that experienced the most activity since the start of the year.

As Breitbart Texas reported, authorities in the border states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas documented a dramatic increase in the number of migrants using their states to reach Texas.

376,Guatemalan President to Harris: Grant TPS to U.S.-Based Guatemalans,"Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei urged U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris this week to grant Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to illegal Guatemalan nationals already in America, allowing them to reside legally, work lawfully, and even travel.

TPS eligible migrants may travel back to their home country. However, the U.S. federal government designates that a foreign nation be eligible for the status when its nationals cannot return safely.

Giammattei’s request for TPS came Tuesday, during a phone conversation with Harris, tapped by U.S. President Joe Biden to lead the White House response to the migrant surge that is overwhelming America’s southern border.

The Guatemalan government issued a Spanish-language statement about the encounter on the same day it took place.

“[Giammattei] reiterated Guatemala’s interest in granting TPS Status to Guatemalan citizens who currently reside in the United States,” the Spanish-language statement read.

Presidente @DrGiammattei y vicepresidenta de Estados Unidos, @KamalaHarris, revisan temas de la agenda bilateral 🇹🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/II0RDUGkG3 — Gobierno Guatemala (@GuatemalaGob) March 30, 2021

The White House issued a readout of the phone conversation without mentioning the Guatemalan president’s TPS request.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services lists the following temporary conditions as reasons why the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may designate a country for TPS:

Ongoing armed conflict (such as civil war); An environmental disaster (such as earthquake or hurricane), or an epidemic. [As well as] other [unidentified] extraordinary and temporary conditions.

Profound malnutrition is reportedly driving Guatemalans to the U.S. border.

On Thursday, the Washington Post linked the “hunger crisis” in Guatemala to climate change, noting:

Guatemala now has the sixth-highest rate of chronic malnutrition in the world. The number of acute cases in children, according to one new Guatemalan government study, doubled between 2019 and 2020. The crisis was caused in part by failed harvests linked to climate change, a string of natural disasters and a nearly nonexistent official response.

Neither the U.S. government nor its Guatemalan counterpart mentioned the hunger crisis in their statements about the meeting.

Nevertheless, the White House indicated that Harris and Giammattei had agreed to work together on climate change and other issues to deal with the root causes of migration to the United States.

The White House stated:

They agreed to explore innovative opportunities to create jobs and to improve the conditions for all people in Guatemala and the region, including by promoting transparency and combating crime.

Harris and Giammattei agreed to collaborate on promoting economic development, leveraging technology, strengthening climate resilience, and creating the conditions to expand opportunity for people in their home countries to address the root causes of migration to the United States.

The Guatemalan statement also noted that the two leaders discussed several issues that affect both countries.

They reviewed issues on the rich bilateral agenda such as cooperation for economic and social development, border security, and migration, among others that allow combating the structural causes that motivate irregular migration.

Harris thanked the Guatemalan leader for his efforts to secure the Central American country’s southern border with Mexico, the White House acknowledged.

Giammattei could pressure the Biden administration for TPS in exchange for continuing their border security efforts.

Some Salvadorans and Hondurans who arrived many years ago are already enrolled in TPS, but the many recent migrants from those countries are not enrolled. As the name suggests, TPS is intended to be a temporary benefit. However, the U.S. has repeatedly extended TPS for some countries.

Migrants from the Northern Triangle, a Central American region covering Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, make up most migrants feeding the ongoing surge at the U.S.-Mexico border.",1
377,Maduro Regime Numbers Show Record Coronavirus Cases in Venezuela,"Venezuela experienced its highest number of documented Chinese coronavirus cases nationwide since the pandemic began Wednesday, according to socialist regime officials, suggesting a significant surge in the national infection rate.

Epidemiologists have for months questioned the suspiciously low rate of infection in Venezuela — a nation with a barely-existent healthcare system, poor sanitation, and an ongoing migrant crisis — according to socialist regime statistics. While neighboring Colombia and Brazil have documented more cases of Chinese coronavirus than nearly every country in the world, Venezuela claims a relatively small 160,000 nationwide cases of the highly contagious disease as of Thursday.

The socialist regime of dictator Nicolás Maduro has implemented a bizarre social distancing regimen known as “7+7,” not used anywhere else in the world, in which the regime forces a strict lockdown nationwide for seven days, followed by seven days of no restrictions at all. Maduro has sometimes modified the plan to allow for two weeks of freedom after two weeks of lockdown at a time. It is not clear who created the “7+7” plan and there is no evidence that it has prevented the spread of Chinese coronavirus more than either extended lockdowns or limited government intervention in people’s lives.

Maduro has also heavily promoted dubious alleged “cures” for coronavirus infections, most prominently Carvativir, oil droplets made of thyme and oregano. Maduro refers to them as “miracle droplets” on state television and claims they cure coronavirus infections. No scientific evidence exists for this claim, which has resulted in social media outlets like Facebook censoring Maduro’s account for health misinformation.

Maduro’s Vice President Delcy Rodríguez announced the regime confirmed 13 coronavirus deaths and 1,348 new infections, the largest single-day totals for the country since the pandemic began. The largest single-day total documented prior to Wednesday occurred on Monday; officials confirmed 1,288 cases that day.

While the numbers continue to increase in the country, the Maduro regime’s statistics still remain significantly lower than totals in neighboring countries. Brazil has documented nearly 13 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began and Colombia 2.4 million, compared to 160,497 cases in Venezuela. Both Brazil and Colombia have taken in a significant percentage of the millions of Venezuelan refugees who have fled socialism for the past decade in a crisis that continues to this day. Maduro’s regime has yet to provide an adequate explanation for the disparities between Venezuela and its neighbors. Investigators and journalists have concluded that the Maduro regime is severely undercounting the number of Chinese coronavirus cases in the country. In October, the Venezuelan polling firm Meganálisis published the results of a questionnaire regarding coronavirus health care. Surveying people who said that they lived in a household with someone diagnosed with Chinese coronavirus, Meganálisis found that nearly 70 percent of respondents lived with someone who was told they had coronavirus without being tested in any way to confirm an infection. Only 13 percent of those who said they lived with a coronavirus patient said that they had received PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, a test that confirms the presence of the genetic material consistent with Chinese coronavirus in the body. The Maduro regime is using a combination of PCR and more inaccurate “rapid” testing to confirm cases and thus add them to their tally, but it is not clear if those who only test positive using rapid tests contribute to formal statistics.

The Meganálisis poll asked all respondents if they trusted the official government statistics, to which 72 percent said “no.”

With cases rising, Maduro’s regime has turned the attention of the country onto the planned arrival of doses of Sputnik V, a Russian-made coronavirus vaccine candidate. Maduro’s state broadcaster VTV announced a third shipment of Sputnik V doses arrived in Venezuela on Monday, representing 50,000 doses of the product. Russian President Vladimir Putin approved Sputnik V in August, making it the first approved coronavirus vaccine candidate, but did so prior to Phase III clinical testing and without divulging key research data to the broader scientific community, causing international concern.

Maduro has also claimed to secure shipments of “Abdala,” a coronavirus vaccine candidate under development in Cuba. Abdala remains in the clinical trial phase and has not been approved for general use anywhere in the world.

While the vaccines arrive, Maduro has also promoted Carvativir and ozone therapy — the administration of toxic ozone gas to coronavirus patients — as “cures” to the disease, opening a “National Ozone Center” for access to “rectal ozone therapy” and claiming to pressure the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) to study Carvativir. Carvativir has become a point of contention between Maduro and Facebook, which banned him from posting on his official page for 30 days this week in response to repeated violations of its misinformation policy.

While there is no proof suggesting the Carvativir droplets have any positive effect in fighting Chinese coronavirus, no evidence exists that they are dangerous, either. Ozone, however, is a deadly gas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that the amount of ozone it takes to kill Chinese coronavirus cells is higher than the amount necessary to kill a human being, making it an undesirable treatment for coronavirus infection.",1
378,Biden Official Blames 'Predatory Elites' in Americas for Border Crisis,"Latin American “predatory elites” who stand to benefit from the status quo share the blame of the U.S. border crisis with Central American governments and migrants, a top Biden aide and unassociated poll recently asserted.

While the Biden administration believes “predatory elites” in the source countries of the migrant surge are the culprits behind the border crisis, a non-governmental poll recently showed that many Americans also blame Central American governments, migrants, the U.S. president, and Congress.

The Yahoo News/YouGov poll results unveiled Monday show that Democrats and independents are more likely than Republicans to blame the migrants’ country of origin for most of the issues at the U.S. border.

In blaming the “predatory elites,” Juan Gonzalez, the White House National Security Council’s senior director for the Western Hemisphere and a special assistant to U.S. President Joe Biden, appeared to be trying to deflect any of the blame for the border placed on the commander-in-chief by members of both parties.

Last Friday, the National Public Radio (NPR) reported:

Many migrants who come to the U.S. border from Central America are doing so because of “a predatory elite” who are tied to a host of problems in their home countries — not because of President Biden’s easing of Trump-era immigration policies, according to Juan Gonzalez, a top aide to Biden on immigration.

“You have, frankly, a predatory elite that benefits from the status quo, which is to not pay any taxes or invest in social programs,” Gonzalez explained.

“Migration is essentially a social release valve for migrants,” he noted, adding that remittances from their earnings in the U.S. drive more consumption in their country of origin, benefiting powerful elites there.

'Predatory Elite' Also Bear The Blame For Migrant Crisis. https://t.co/GAicplHf7r — Juan S. Gonzalez (@Cartajuanero) March 26, 2021

Unaccompanied children, family units, and other migrants from the Northern Triangle, a region that encompasses El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, make up the bulk of the migrant surge.

This month, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele conceded that his country’s inability to provide security and economic opportunities drives migrants he wants to keep inside his country to the U.S. border.

He stressed that the exodus of migrants to the U.S. border is bad for America and even worse for the Latin American countries they are leaving behind.

According to the results of a Yahoo News/YouGov poll, nearly two-thirds of respondents said Central American leaders bear either most of the blame (29 percent) or some of it (35 percent).

Together (64 percent) and on their own, Democrats (33 percent) and independents (31 percent) blame Central American leaders for most of the problems at the southern border more than Republicans (25 percent).

However, Republicans who said Central American governments bear some of the blame exceeded Democrats and independents.

Six out of ten Americans believe the U.S. Congress either bears most of the blame (24 percent) or some of the blame (36 percent), the poll found.

Republicans, including former President Donald Trump supporters, and independents are more likely to blame Congress for most of the border problems than Democrats.

A slim majority of respondents blamed the migrants for the border crisis, with 52 percent saying they either bear most (24 percent) or some (28 percent) of the blame.

Republicans are more likely to blame the migrants than Democrats and independents.

The poll surveyed 1,556 U.S. adults between March 23 and 25, finding that 62 percent of respondents believe there is indeed a border “crisis,” a phrase the Biden administration has bent over backward to avoid, calling it a border “challenge” instead.

Just under half (45 percent) of respondents said they believe the border’s situation has worsened under Biden. Only 19 percent said it has improved, while 36 percent told pollsters they are unsure.

Republicans and independents are less likely to say the situation has gotten better when compared to Democrats.",1
379,CIS: 'No Guarantee' Biden's Migrant Airlift Program Will Help Border,"U.S. President Joe Biden wants to expand Obama-era programs that offer to fly Central American migrants directly into the United States, an immigration expert told Breitbart News this week.

However, the Obama-era two-in-one Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole program may not ease the border crisis, Dr. Nayla Rush, a senior researcher a the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), told Breitbart News.

This month, the Biden administration revived the CAM program ended by former President Donald Trump in 2017.

In an email statement to Breitbart News, a spokesperson for the State Department, which administers CAM, cited section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. section 1157 as the legal authority for CAM.

Rush told Breitbart News that legal authority only applies to the Refugee part of CAM, not the Parole part.

“The Parole part could be sued,” she added. “The Refugee processing is legal. “However, the new proposed Central American plan, as introduced in [Biden’s January 2020] Immigration Bill, will only have one program for refugees.”

“The Biden administration seeks to replace the Obama-era two-in-one refugee/parole approach with a new three-part version of CAM, with three distinct programs with three specific protection schemes, Rush noted.

This expansion is included in the comprehensive amnesty and migration-expansion bill announced by Biden on January 20, which provides a window into what the president plans to do with CAM, the CIS expert noted.

In describing the three programs under the new CAM, she said, “The ‘Central American Refugee Program’ will give access to ‘refugee resettlement;’ the ‘Central American Family Reunification Parole Program’ will give access to ‘parole;’ and the ‘Central American Minors Program’ will give access to a new ‘special immigrant” status.'”

According to Rush, Biden’s CAM version will provide access to permanent residence in the United States.

Biden wants to expand CAM to allow vast numbers of migrants from Central America to legally enter the country via expanded side doors in current immigration law.

Breitbart News also spoke to Rush about a March 24 CIS report she authored on what Biden plans to do with CAM.

In the report, titled Biden’s Plan for Central American Migrants: Fly Them Straight to the U.S., Rush noted:

The question remains: Will reopening in-country processing (or what I have called the “back door”) convince people to apply for a ticket instead of simply showing up at the door? This disincentivizing strategy did not seem to work for the Obama administration; it may not for this one either. Biden’s plan may be more elaborate than Obama’s, but there is no guarantee it will help resolve the ongoing border crisis.

Obama-Biden administration officials launched CAM in 2014. In 2016, the Obama administration expanded eligibility beyond “minor children” to adult sons and daughters of U.S.-based parents as well as adult “caregivers,” including grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles.

The Trump administration terminated the program in 2017, but now President Joe Biden plans to rebuild and expand it.

“The Central American Minors (CAM) program provides the opportunity to certain qualified children from El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to apply for refugee status [or parole] if they have one or more parents lawfully present in the United States,” a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Breitbart News.

“Certain qualifying family members of those children may also be eligible for CAM processing,” the spokesperson acknowledged.

Rush from CIS explained that being “lawfully present” does not necessarily mean having “lawful status.”

“Most of the parents making use of the program [under Obama] were illegal immigrants who were ‘lawfully present’ because they had received Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED),” she noted in her report.

Referring to the expansion of CAM eligibility requirements, the State Department spokesperson noted that former President Barack Obama expanded the eligibility categories in 2016 to include certain relationships when accompanied by a qualifying child.

The spokesperson described those relationships as “children of the U.S.-based lawfully present parent who were married and/or over the age of 21; the in-country biological parents of the qualifying child; or a caregiver of the qualifying child who was related to either the U.S.-based lawfully-present parent or qualifying child.”

Unlike Obama’s CAM, which waited for Central Americans to express interest in emigrating to the United States, Biden’s revamped version will proactively seek out foreigners to bring into communities across the country, Rush wrote in the CIS report.

Despite the changes, “the rationale is the same: Don’t come here illegally because we will design in-country processing programs to get you in legally,” she added.

“That was, in essence, DHS [Department of Homeland Security] Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ recent message to Central Americans rushing to the Southern border when he asked them to ‘wait,'” Rush also wrote.

The Biden administration hopes that expanding the CAM will allow it to accept millions of migrants by essentially turning “illegal entries into legal ones,” Rush indicated.

“What the Biden administration meant by ‘wait, don’t come now,’ is really, ‘don’t come this way, we are designing legal pathways that will allow us to fly you here directly,'” Rush noted in the report.

President Biden expects CAM to allocate U.S. taxpayer-funded resources again to fly illegal aliens directly from Central America into the United States to relieve them of the burden of a harrowing and dangerous journey.

“This humanitarian program discourages minors and families from making the risky journey to the U.S. border by offering the alternative of a safe and legal pathway,” the spokesperson from State said about CAM.

Reviving and expanding CAM is also intended to “ease pressure at the southern border” where “resources are overwhelmed” by the surge of migrants predominantly from the Northern Triangle, she added.

The Northern Triangle is a region in Central America that encompasses El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

On March 10, the U.S. Department of State, which administers CAM, announced the program’s revival.

“We are expanding legal pathways to enter the United States by reopening the Central American Minors (CAM) program,” read a statement from State.

Rush explained to Breitbart News that the Biden administration intends to reopen CAM in two phases.

“The first will process eligible applications that were closed when the program was terminated in 2017, and the second will begin to accept new applications with updated guidance to follow,” she said.

Rush noted, “Are we certain these individuals are still in need of protection four or more years later? And if they were at risk of harm in their own countries since 2017 (or earlier), how did they manage to get by all those years?”

President Biden has already directed the Departments of State and Homeland Security (DHS) to initiate the first phase.

“Eligibility will remain the same [as it was under former President Barack Obama] in the first phase of the CAM restart,” the State Department spokesperson told Breitbart News. “We have not yet determined whether eligibility will be further expanded in the second phase when new applications will be accepted.”

Rush described Biden’s CAM as “an expansion of in-country processing of asylum seekers. Except that his new programs are mainly for non-refugees.”

“Any individual can apply for the refugee status under Biden’s Central American Refugee Program,” she added. “No sponsoring parents are needed.”

Biden may also extend the program to all of Central America at the Secretary of State’s discretion.

Furthermore, “Expedited processing of applications and requests” can “be provided in emergency situations, for humanitarian reasons, or if the secretary of State otherwise determines that circumstances warrant expedited treatment,” Rush said of Biden’s CAM.

President Biden can implement his CAM version’s refugee and family reunification components by executive fiat, as his old boss Obama did in 2014.

However, Rush said that adding the “Central American Minors Program” component will require legislative action.

Courts may also seek to prevent Biden from implementing his version of CAM.",1
380,Brazil’s Military Leaders Quit En Masse After Bolsonaro Fires Defense Minister,"The heads of Brazil’s Army, Navy, and Air Force all resigned simultaneously on Tuesday in what multiple Brazilian outlets described as a “turbulent” meeting with Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto, who assumed the position on the same day.

Conservative President Jair Bolsonaro accepted the resignation of Braga Netto’s predecessor, Fernando Azevedo e Silva, on Monday. The three military leaders allegedly opposed his replacement. Azevedo’s departure followed the controversial resignation of Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo on Monday after the top diplomat accused members of Congress of pressuring him to support the introduction of Chinese telecommunications company Huawei into Brazil’s market. Araújo’s supporters accused the Chinese government of pressuring Bolsonaro to replace Araújo with a more malleable diplomat in the eyes of the Communist Party.

Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, Attorney General Andre Levi, and several other cabinet members also recently departed their posts. Braga Netto served as Bolsonaro’s chief of staff before assuming the defense ministry post.

The government offered few official statements on the military shake-up and pro-Bolsonaro media noted that replacing military branch leaders often does coincide with a change in the Defense Ministry. Sources within the government speaking to the conservative Brazilian outlet Terça Livre insisted it would have been stranger for one of the three branches to lose its leader without the other witnessing similar reform. Terça nonetheless noted the head of the Army, Edson Leal Pujol, had faced “friction” with the Bolsonaro government, making him a likely candidate for replacement. In Brazil, the nation’s president is also the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

Mainstream outlets depicted the departures as chaos, however, hinting at major rifts between Bolsonaro and Brazil’s top brass, despite Bolsonaro’s background as a military captain. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo, also citing anonymous sources, reported on Wednesday that military leaders had “set aside their passive stance, which allowed the president to give the impression he had the support of the troops for his speeches” and had thus enacted this mass resignation to give the appearance Bolsonaro was isolated in the presidential palace. The newspaper claimed Azevedo’s removal as defense minister occurred shortly after Bolsonaro urged him to replace Pujol.

This, other outlets like the far-left Folha de Sao Paulo noted, prompted Pujol’s colleagues at the other military branches to resign alongside him in a combative meeting with Braga Netto. The newspaper also reported the Bolsonaro government downplayed anonymous reports of a tense meeting and insisted no significant changes would occur at the military, including any changes that would empower the military politically.

Reports that anti-Bolsonaro leaders in the military decided not to remain “passive” come at a sensitive time for Brazil. The nation marks the anniversary of the 1964 military overthrow of the left-wing government on Wednesday. The military leadership during the junta government was largely pro-American and acted with force against communists in the country. Leftists denounce the coup as a violation of democratic principles and accuse the military of sweeping human rights abuses.

Bolsonaro has not made any significant public remark on the anniversary this year at press time, instead, using his social media accounts to focus on news about the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. His son, Sao Paulo lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro, posted an homage to the military describing the coup as legal and necessary.

“On March 31, 1964, the Armed Forces acted WITHIN THE LAW, with massive and previously existing POPULAR SUPPORT, guaranteeing a FREE BRAZIL,” he wrote on Twitter. “Given the story told by the same bandits on the left, let us always remember: those who defended DEMOCRACY were not them, but the brave members of the Armed Forces.”

Em 31 de março, de 1964, as Forças Armadas agiram DENTRO DA LEI, com massivo e prévio APOIO POPULAR, garantindo um BRASIL LIVRE Embora a história contada pelos mesmos bandidos da esquerda, lembremos sempre: quem defendia a DEMOCRACIA não eram eles, mas os bravos membros das FFAA pic.twitter.com/qq25Dg9gTj — Eduardo Bolsonaro🇷 (@BolsonaroSP) March 31, 2021

The alleged tensions between Bolsonaro and the military appear to be separate from the circumstances surrounding former top diplomat Ernesto Araújo’s departure on Monday. Unlike the military leaders, Araújo published a lengthy letter explaining “adversarial” forces, without naming them, had made his job “impossible.”

“The truth liberates and lies enslave,” Araújo’s letter read. “Today, lies are shamelessly used for a materialistic project that seeks to enslave Brazil and Brazilians, and enslave the human being himself and rob him of his material and, primarily, spiritual dignity.”

Araújo had accused the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the day before of pressuring him to encourage the Bolsonaro government to “make a move on 5G,” apparently meaning to support the Chinese company Huawei in its quest to land the lucrative contract to build Brazil’s 5G network. Huawei has close ties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and is considered by many nations, including the United States, to represent a national security threat. The accused senator confirmed she discussed Huawei with Araújo but disparaged him as an “outcast” for his firm stance against Chinese colonialism in the country.

Brazilian media described the Chinese Communist Party as having visible “discomfort” with Araújo for his refusal to facilitate greater Chinese influence in the country in the aftermath of his dismissal.

381,Mafia Fugitive Caught After Police Find His YouTube Cooking Show,"A mafia fugitive was arrested in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, after Italian police discovered his YouTube cooking show.

The Italian gangster had concealed his face from the camera’s view while appearing on the YouTube cooking show with his wife, but had failed to hide his tattoos, which made him identifiable to police, according to a report by La Repubblica.

Marc Feren Claude Biart — a Roman-born drug trafficker — had been in hiding for five years, “but his tattoos and love for cooking betrayed him,” the Italian news outlet reports.

Biart is allegedly connected to the Cacciola clan of the ‘Ndrangheta in Rosarno, Italy — a prominent Italian mafia-style organized crime group based in the southern region of Calabria, which forms the tip of Italy’s “boot.”

The ‘Ndrangheta is considered to be one of the world’s most powerful crime syndicates because of its control of most of the cocaine that enters Europe, reports the Guardian.

‘Ndrangheta has also expanded its reach across all parts of the world, and is considered far more powerful than Sicily’s famous “Cosa Nostra” mafia organization.

The gangster had taken refuge in Boca Chica, a tourist resort near Santo Domingo, where he was careful not to attract attention to himself. He also avoided the local Italian community.

But after starting a cooking show with his wife on YouTube, and inadvertently tipping police off by seeming to forget to conceal his tattoos on his arms, Biart was caught.

Biart was identified by the “Interpol Cooperation Against ‘Ndrangheta,” which is made up of State Police, the Carabinieri, and the Guardia di Finanza — Italy’s three main law enforcement agencies — with the help of the Interpol of the Dominican Republic, as well as an Italian security expert in Santo Domingo.

Another ‘Ndrangheta mobster, Francesco Pelle — who was considered one of the most dangerous Italian fugitives — was arrested in Portugal on Monday, after being on the run for 14 years, reports the Guardian.

Pelle was tracked down at a clinic in Lisbon, where he had been receiving treatment for the Chinese coronavirus.

382,Brazil’s Top Diplomat Quits Under Pressure from China,"Brazil’s Foreign Affairs Minister Ernesto Araújo resigned on Monday, shortly after accusing pro-China lawmakers of pressuring him into supporting granting compromised telecommunications company Huawei Brazil’s lucrative pending contract to build a 5G network.

Prior to his resignation, Araujo had developed a reputation for being one of President Jair Bolsonaro’s staunchest anti-communist officials and a particularly vocal opponent of China’s attempts to control Brazilian politics. While Bolsonaro ran a presidential campaign on limiting China’s attempts at “buying” Brazil, as president he has strengthened ties to Beijing through economic deals and visited Beijing personally to attract further Chinese investment in the country.

China’s “discomfort” with Araujo maintaining the policy line that Bolsonaro had campaigned on with regards to the communist power was “evident and frequently emerged in private conversations,” the Brazilian newspaper O Globo noted this week.

“I struggled from the beginning for the freedom and dignity of Brazil and the Brazilian people, for our sovereignty and greatness in all aspects,” Araújo’s resignation letter to Bolsonaro, which he posted to Twitter, read in part. “I tried — before many, many colleagues for whom ‘diplomat’ and ‘patriot’ are not antonyms — to place Itamaraty [the Brazilian Foreign Ministry] at the service of the dream of a new Brazil.”

Araújo went on to state that he had been facing increasingly “adversarial” forces that had created a situation in which “it is impossible for me to continue working for our ideals in the position that I currently occupy.” The top diplomat specifically mentioned accusations that his resistance to Chinese influence had hurt Brazil’s attempts to acquire vaccines from foreign countries and claimed them all to be “false and hypocritical.”

“Unfortunately, in this moment of national life, the truth doesn’t matter for the forces that want to return to power — that force that, during the decades it ruled, only brought Brazil backwardness, corruption, and disgrace,” Araújo said, an apparent reference to the controversial release of former socialist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva from prison despite multiple convictions on extensive corruption charges.

“The truth liberates and lies enslave,” the letter continued. “Today, lies are shamelessly used for a materialistic project that seeks to enslave Brazil and Brazilians, and enslave the human being himself and rob him of his material and, primarily, spiritual dignity.”

Apresentei hoje ao Presidente Jair Bolsonaro esta carta em que coloquei à sua disposição o cargo de Ministro das Relações Exteriores: pic.twitter.com/laHBOmUhIt — Ernesto Araújo (@ernestofaraujo) March 29, 2021

The day before his resignation, Araújo published a message on Twitter accusing Senator Kátia Abreu of the left-wing Progressive party of pressuring him to allow Huawei, a Chinese telecommunications company, to build Brazil’s 5G network. Abreu runs the Brazilian Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

“On March 4 I had lunch with [Abreu],” Araújo wrote. “Short conversation. Little to nothing about vaccines. At the end, at the table, she says, ‘Minister, if you made a mode a move [sic] on 5G, you would be the king of the Senate.’ I made no move.”

Araújo did not mention Huawei, but Brazilian media assumed that, given his public opposition to allowing Huawei into Brazil due to its close ties with the Communist Party, Huawei was the company in question.

Abreu responded to the tweet with an extended statement referring to Araújo as an “outcast” and demanding his replacement for being “someone who insists on living outside good diplomacy, outside the truth of facts, outside balance and outside respect for institutions.”

Abreu reportedly admitted she defended Huawei as a contender to build the network despite the fact that Araújo’s statement did not mention the company.

Bolsonaro’s government is preparing to open bidding on a 5G contract this summer. In mid-March, Brazilian Communications Minister Fábio Faria admitted Huawei into the bidding process despite extensive national security concerns. A week before Huawei received approval for bidding, Faria ha stated that the company did not meet Brazil’s standards for such a large government contract. Faria visited Beijing shortly before the reversal.

Abreu was far from the only member of Congress pressuring Araújo to be more friendly to China. In its report noting China’s “discomfort” with the top diplomat, O Globo noted that the president of the Chamber of Deputies (roughly equivalent to the U.S. Speaker of the House) Arthur Lira met with a senior Chinese official last week for a conversation that the newspaper categorized as “mainly an attempt by Lira to occupy what he perceived to be a vacuum left by Araújo in the relationship with China.” Lira won the presidency of the lower house in part through an alliance with Bolsonaro against the further left forces in the lawmaking body.

O Globo reported following Araújo’s resignation that Bolsonaro was likely to choose someone more “pragmatic” that could “facilitate” ties with China following his former top diplomat’s departure, placing Brazilian Ambassador to Paris Luis Fernando Serra at the top of the list of possible replacements. Bolsonaro’s Washington envoy, Nestor Forster, is another option, though one O Globo suggested would find little support in Congress due to his proximity to Araújo and high likelihood of continuing the latter’s policies.

383,Over 60 Cuban Activists Mark Ten Days of Hunger Strike,"Over 60 members of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), believed to be the island’s largest pro-democracy dissident group, marked ten days of a group hunger strike against the regime on Monday.

UNPACU leader José Daniel Ferrer, who is participating in the hunger strike, said in public statements that police had surrounded his group’s headquarters in Santiago de Cuba, the largest city on the island’s east side. UNPACU had begun attempting to distribute food and medicine out of its headquarters in light of growing shortages that greatly escalated in the past three years, though have become even more acute as the Chinese coronavirus pandemic limits tourism revenue for the regime. Police agents surrounded the headquarters to prevent the distribution of humanitarian aid, prompting the hunger strike.

“There are over 60 activists on hunger strike and four who had to abandon [the strike] given health problems,” Ferrer said. “The tyranny fears us. Gandhi achieved more with a hunger strike than the United States with thousands of soldiers in Vietnam.”

“Down with communism. Down with hunger and misery,” he concluded.

The strike began on March 20; including that day, those participating have spent ten days without food.

Ferrer also shared a video on Sunday of the UNPACU headquarters and some of those on hunger strike inside. Given the many days without food, many of those in the video are lying down and appear immobile and extremely thin.

In an update last week, Ferrer stated 63 people were on hunger strike, 55 of them within Cuba. Not all of those in Cuba are concentrating in the Santiago headquarters. One woman, Niuvys Vicet Romero, told the website ADN Cuba that she chose to participate in the protest as a UNPACU member despite the government repeatedly threatening to take her two children away if she continued to participate in anti-communist activism.

“My only fear is that they seize my house, they take my children and put them in a disciplinary school, as they’ve threatened me with so many times,” Vicet said. “To this add political repression against vulnerable people, old people, women, and minors, who just wanted to receive food or medicine at the UNPACU headquarters. My own children were violently assaulted by political police and threatened with being interned in a juvenile detention center because they received food.”

The Organization of American States (OAS) weighed in on the hunger strikes this weekend. Secretary-General Luis Almagro, whose sternly worded statements have irked Latin America’s socialist dictatorships, urged “the end of repression, especially the use of police violence to suppress the humanitarian work that the Patriotic Union of Cuba conducts.”

“We once again ask the international community to take concrete actions to end impunity for the Castro regime,” Almagro stated. “We denounce that the dictatorship in Havana applies state terrorism against its citizens. It does so through violence on the part of its repressive system, through harassment, and through arbitrary detentions.”

Hunger strikes have a long history as a tool in the arsenal of pro-democracy dissidents in Cuba, and the Castro regime has a long history of allowing hunger strikers to die without meeting their often modest requests for enhanced freedoms and limitations on communism. UNPACU itself has held several mass hunger strike initiatives in recent memory to pressure the Castro regime into humanitarian reforms with little success. In 2019, for example, 89 UNPACU members held a hunger strike to protest proposed constitutional reforms that would expand the Communist Party’s powers on paper to better match the reality of the abuses Havana regularly perpetrates against its people. In a letter to President Donald Trump, the hunger strikers described similar harassment and abuse as what they are experiencing today.

“Since February 11th, the regime’s repressive forces have permanently surrounded the organization’s headquarters and have arrested those that attempt to enter or exit. For example, a 16-year-old has been beaten and detained as he left the headquarters in search of food for his 23-month-old niece since food items were stolen during the raid,” the letter read in part. “Although repression has been occurring with unusual fury in the last few days, actually since our campaign for the ‘NO’ to the Constitution began, the regime has increased its attacks against us.”

The constitutional reforms “passed” in an unfree referendum and, by the end of the year, José Daniel Ferrer had disappeared. Cuban state security arrested him on October 1, 2019, after a raid on the UNPACU headquarters and disappeared him for weeks, prompting protests organized by UNPACU, his family, and international calls from human rights groups for proof that he was alive and safe. While ultimately revealing that Ferrer was alive and imprisoned after international repudiation, the Cuban regime kept him in prison for six months without due process. Ferrer was freed in March 2020 into “house arrest” and vaguely accused of battery against an unknown assailant with no evidence of any such incident divulged.

Police briefly arrested Ferrer and his wife and child in November 2019 again after Ferrer failed to cease his activism.

384,Facebook Locks Out Maduro for 30 Days over Fake Coronavirus Cures,"Venezuelan socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro lost access to his Facebook page for a month, the BBC reported Sunday, for repeatedly promoting unproven Chinese coronavirus cures and violating the social media company’s posting standards.

Maduro has spent months promoting two uniquely Venezuelan coronavirus “cures”: the rectal administration of ozone, a potentially fatal toxic gas, to kill coronavirus cells; and Carvativir, or “miracle droplets” reportedly made of thyme and oregano. While Maduro has insisted that the two methods have saved untold lives under his regime, minimal scientific research exists into these methods and no evidence suggests they have any significant success against Chinese coronavirus. The American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has explicitly warned that ozone therapy is more likely to kill a person before killing enough coronavirus cells in that person’s body to make a difference in curtailing infection.

While Facebook has limited Maduro’s reach, World Health Organization (W.H.O.) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is not a medical doctor, entertained the regime’s false cures during a conversation with Maduro Vice President Delcy Rodríguez this weekend.

The United Nations, of which the W.H.O. is a subsidiary, considers Maduro the president of Venezuela despite his final term legally ending in January 2019. The true president of Venezuela is a lawmaker named Juan Guaidó, who has failed to use his constitutional powers as the nation’s armed forces remain illegally loyal to Maduro.

Facebook confirmed to the BBC in a report published Sunday that Maduro had lost access to the platform for at least 30 days due to posting false information about coronavirus treatments.

“We removed a video posted to President Nicolás Maduro’s page for violating our policies against misinformation about Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] that is likely to put people at risk for harm,” a spokesperson for the company said. “We follow guidance from the W.H.O. [World Health Organization] that says there is currently no medication to cure the virus. Due to repeated violations of our rules, we are also freezing the page for 30 days, during which it will be read-only.”

Spain’s El País reported that the offending content that triggered the temporary ban was a video published in January in which Maduro promoted Carvativir describing it as “miracle droplets” and claiming it could fully cure Chinese coronavirus infections. The report did not clarify why the temporary ban is occurring months after the publishing of content violating posting guidelines.

At the time, Facebook prevented Maduro from uploading Carvativir videos, prompting a televised rant by the dictator against Facebook owner Mark Zuckerberg.

“Who is in charge in Venezuela, the owner of Facebook? Who rules the world, the owner of Facebook? Zuckerberg is a tremendous abuser,” Maduro railed. “The world has to reflect on the abuses of social networks. They are multimillionaire people who try to impose their truths, their reasons, their abuses on the world.”

Maduro appeared to be able to access his account after this incident until this week.

Facebook limiting the Venezuelan socialist dictatorship’s access to its platform occurred nearly simultaneously with Tedros thanking Rodríguez, Maduro’s “vice president,” for what he called a “constructive call” on the pandemic. Tedros claimed on Twitter — an outlet that has not yet censored Maduro’s false coronavirus cure content — that the talk focused on using the United Nations Covax platform to ensure that Venezuelans receive doses of vaccines against the virus.

Gracias, Vice-President @DRodriguez_en for a constructive call on #Venezuela’s need for #COVID19 vaccines. @WHO, @pahowho & #COVAX are committed to ensuring & accelerating the flow of vaccines to 🇻 & all countries, so that priority groups can be vaccinated A.S.A.P. #VaccinEquity — Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) March 27, 2021

Rodríguez, on her Twitter account, claimed the conversation was about Carvativir.

“We also informed [Tedros] about the advances in our clinical trials of Carvativir and other anti-virals studied in our country,” Rodríguez wrote. “From Venezuela, we join this tough battle [against] the worst pandemic humanity has ever known! United as one world we will come out victorious.”

También informamos al @DrTedros sobre los avances de los ensayos clínicos del Carvativir y otros antivirales bajo estudio en nuestro país. Desde Venezuela nos sumamos a esta dura batalla x la peor pandemia q ha conocido la humanidad!Unidos como un solo mundo saldremos victoriosos pic.twitter.com/QvdLdbmRHC — Delcy Rodríguez (@drodriven2) March 27, 2021

The conversation with Tedros appears to be part of a greater effort on Maduro’s part to acquire doses of coronavirus vaccines and vaccine candidates. On Sunday, Maduro suggested in a nationally televised broadcast that he could offer nations that have developed coronavirus vaccine candidates crude oil in exchange for doses.

“Venezuela has the oil ships, it has the clients, so that they buy our oil and would dedicate part of their production to guarantee all the vaccines Venezuela needs,” Maduro said, without specifying a country. “Oil for vaccines!”

Russia and China, two of Maduro’s few remaining allies on the globe, have produced local vaccine candidates against the virus currently in distribution at home. As both rogue states rely on many of the same alliances, they are competing for the attention of states that would not contract with more reliable pharmaceutical companies in countries like the United States or India.

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov is traveling to Caracas as of Monday to meet with high-ranking Maduro officials, the Spanish news service EFE reported. EFE suggested Borisov’s first and most important meeting in the country would be with Tareck El Aissami, Venezuela’s oil minister and considered Maduro’s top liaison to the Iranian terrorist organization Hezbollah. The report did not clarify if Russia’s vaccine candidate, Sputnik V, would factor into any oil deals with Caracas.

385,Authorities Discover 44 U.S.-Bound Migrant Minors in Central Mexico,"Federal authorities in Mexico detained 81 Central American migrants who had entered their country illegally. The group told officials they were headed for the U.S. border. Authorities described 44 of the 81 migrants as being underage.

The apprehension took place this week in the central Mexican state of Puebla. State police and members of Mexico’s National Migration Institute (INM) raided a human smuggling stash house with 81 migrants inside, a prepared statement disclosed. During the raid, the migrants could not prove that they were in Mexico legally and the adults were taken for deportation procedures, according to the INM written statement.

Officials turned the underage migrants and the family groups over to the System for the Development of Children and Families (DIF) for processing.

Officials described the demographic makeup of the group as:

46 migrants from Honduras, including nine underage females, 18 underage males, ten women, and nine men.

18 migrants from Guatemala, including four underage females, six underage males, seven women, and one man.

16 migrants from El Salvador, including seven underage females, two women, and seven men.

One adult woman from Nicaragua.

The apprehension comes at a time when Mexican authorities are experiencing an increasing number of human smuggling attempts and apprehensions nationwide since the start of the year. The move forced Mexico’s government to deploy 8,700 soldiers to help carry out immigration enforcement in an attempt to bolster the overwhelmed INM agents and federal police officers.

386,Venezuela’s Maduro: ‘The U.S. Left the Rest of the World Without Vaccines’,"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro complained on Thursday at an event allegedly meant to address public education that the United States had hoarded the world’s supply of Chinese coronavirus vaccines, addressing a European incident involving British-Swedish company Astra-Zeneca.

At a televised event branded “every family a school” – meant to celebrate Venezuela’s alleged virtual school program that has replaced its dilapidated education system throughout the pandemic – Maduro claimed his illegitimate regime would soon begin administering vaccine-like products from Russia, China, and Cuba, and claimed socialist rulers are cutting deals for large shipments of vaccines. He did not clarify what, if any, obstacle the United States had placed in the way of the alleged inoculation program.

“The vaccine will continue with much seriousness,” Maduro claimed, referring to the inoculation program. “Now you guys have seen a meeting of the European Union where they declared an emergency due to lack of vaccines in the world. The U.S. has monopolized all the vaccines. They have taken them for themselves and left the rest of the world without vaccines.”

“The European Union has been able to advance just 20 percent of the initial [vaccination] plan. There is a significant vaccine shortage,” Maduro continued. “We are working with the Chinese vaccine, the Russian vaccines, now in April the experiments for the two Cuban vaccines, Soberana 02 and Abdala, will begin in Venezuela with the idea that in July we will be conducting mass immunizations with Abdala.”

Buena jornada de trabajo dedicada a la educación de nuestros niños, niñas y jóvenes. Revisamos todos los planes formativos que se encuentran en marcha: “Cada Familia una Escuela” y “Universidad en Casa”, aún en tiempos de Pandemia ¡La Educación Venezolana Avanza! pic.twitter.com/en1K4v0vnp — Nicolás Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) March 26, 2021

The European Union is indeed struggling to meet vaccine demand in its respective states, but there is little evidence that the United States or any of the three approved vaccines made in America – by the companies Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson – played any role in the shortages. The E.U. held a summit on Thursday to discuss vaccine distribution that devolved into states accusing more powerful members of hoarding doses away from smaller countries.

“When member states have a lot less vaccines available to them than others, then I think this is a big issue for Europe,” Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz objected. ”This could cause damage to the European Union like we haven’t seen in a long time.”

According to the Associated Press, Kurz lobbied the multinational body to reassess its distribution mechanism to ensure more equitable access to vaccines in light of shortages that some blamed on over-reliance on Astra-Zeneca, as opposed to American companies.

“The problem has been Astra-Zeneca,” the head of the European Commission health agency, Sandra Galina, stated plainly two days before the E.U. summit. Galina explicitly stated that Pfizer and Moderna had fulfilled the commitments in their contracts to supply vaccines to the European Commission, but Astra-Zeneca owed as much as 75 percent of what it had promised in an advanced agreement in August.

Astra-Zeneca is also facing mounting concerns over the safety of its vaccine product – which has not been approved by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning the E.U. is not competing with the U.S. to secure doses – after several countries paused administration of the vaccine product over potential evidence of it causing blood clots.

The U.S. National Institutes of Health issued a statement this week adding to suspicions, stating independent study monitors “expressed concern that Astra-Zeneca may have included outdated information … which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data” in its latest study release.

The Astra-Zeneca debacle has created an opening in the European market for Sputnik V, a Russian-made coronavirus vaccine candidate approved by leader Vladimir Putin in August 2020 prior to completing Phase III clinical trials. Putin, a professional intelligence officer and judoka, has no background in medicine or science. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) announced this month that it had reached agreements with companies in Italy, Spain, France, and Germany for the domestic production of Sputnik V in their respective countries. Several eastern European countries – with the notable exception of Ukraine , which banned the product – have also purchased doses of Sputnik V.

Maduro did not detail any of the background regarding Europe’s scramble to vaccinate its population during Thursday’s broadcast. He concluded by declaring, “Venezuela is the most aggrieved, assaulted, and threatened country by the American empire on the whole of planet – harassed, persecuted every day, and here we are on our feed because we want our nation to be free.”

The Maduro regime has not ruled Venezuela legitimately since January 2019, when Maduro’s last presidential term ended and the National Assembly used its constitutional power to remove Maduro and replace him with President Juan Guaidó. Guaidó has failed to exercise any of his constitutional powers save for installing ambassadors in countries hostile to the socialist dictatorship, so Maduro has continued to govern the country in practice.

The Maduro regime claimed this week that, by Friday, 50,000 teachers in the country will have received some form of coronavirus immunization. Maduro regime-run VTV did not clarify exactly which vaccine or vaccine candidate these individuals had received, though the network has vocally promoted the two Cuban-made vaccine candidates, Abdala and Soberana 02, which have yet to receive approval anywhere in the world.

387,Spain’s Socialists Granted Coronavirus Aid to Maduro-Linked Airline,"Right-wing political parties in Spain demanded an investigation this week into the ruling socialist party’s decision to grant federal aid to Plus Ultra, an obscure airline company with links to the socialist regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.

Pandemic-relief aid granted to Plus Ultra by Spain’s left-wing coalition government – led by the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) – is “irregular” and must be formally investigated, Spain’s conservative Popular Party (PP) said this week.

“The aid does not meet several of the requirements required by the fund to support the solvency of strategic companies. And if it is concluded that there was non-compliance – as the PP considers – it is necessary to revoke the aid granted and clarify responsibilities,” the party said in a statement.

The PP’s parliamentary faction has registered a formal request with the Spanish Congress to investigate the details of the 53 million euros ($62.4 million) in aid granted to Plus Ultra airlines. The aid was granted to the company through a Spanish government subsidies program designed to support companies deemed essential to the Spanish economy during the coronavirus pandemic. PP argued this week that Plus Ultra is far from an essential Spanish company and accused Spanish Finance Minister María Jesús Montero of making false statements assuring the public that the airline was Spanish-majority-owned when asked about its status by the Spanish Congress.

“The group of PP parliamentarians specify that it [Plus Ultra] is a Spanish company, but with a significant weight of Venezuelan and Panamanian capital that diluted Spanish ownership; nor is it a strategic company in the terms required by the [Spanish] Royal Decree in which it intends to cover this aid,” Concepción Gamarra, a spokeswoman for PP parliamentary deputies, said in a statement.

PP further accused Montero of lying about the number of workers that Plus Ultra employed prior to the pandemic, which was information required by the government to determine the amount of pandemic aid a company would receive.

“Plus Ultra had, before the pandemic, 255 workers and not 350 as stated by the Minister of Finance. And it also had four aircraft, of which today only one is left,” PP’s investigation request states, referring to the fact that Plus Ultra recently returned three of its four rented Airbus 340 aircraft to their original owners.

The Popular Party further noted that although the tourism industry was deemed essential to the Spanish economy and thus qualifies for the government subsidy program, this does not mean that a “niche” airline such as Plus Ultra also meets the same qualifications.

“Its strategic nature cannot even be justified by the ‘market niche it occupies,’ because it operated on routes that were already covered by large [Spanish and Colombian airline] companies such as Iberia, Air Europa, or Avianca,” the PP investigation request further states.

“Market figures show that it [Plus Ultra] carried 156,139 passengers in 2019 on 823 flights, putting it at 166th in Spain’s operating airlines, equating to just 0.1 percent market share,” the Olive Press, a Spanish ex-pat newspaper, reported on March 19.

The Spanish right-wing party Vox filed a formal complaint with Spain’s Supreme Court on Wednesday against members of Spain’s ruling left-wing coalition government responsible for granting the 53-million-euro bailout to Plus Ultra.

“The complaint was already advanced this Tuesday by the deputy of Vox, Victor González Coello, of Portugal in Congress, where he denounced the existence of links of this Venezuelan airline with the government of Nicolás Maduro and some of its most significant members,” Spain’s ABC newspaper reported on Thursday.

The PP is concerned that Plus Ultra’s links to South America have led Spanish President and PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez to use the airline as a bargaining chip with the Maduro regime.

“This concern is also bolstered by the fact that one of the majority shareholders in the company, [Camilo] Ibrahim Issa, has strong links to Maduro and the Chavista regime,” the Olive Press noted. Spanish newspaper El Mundo described Issa as Plus Ultra’s “most powerful shareholder” on March 11, citing information from unnamed Spanish opposition sources. Issa is a Venezuelan businessman of Lebanese origin with strong ties to Spain. He single-handedly introduced the Spanish-owned Inditex – the world’s largest fashion group, known for its flagship store, Zara – to Venezuela through his own intermediary retail company, Phoenix, in the early 2000s.

Rarely photographed, Issa was pictured attending a Venezuelan-government funded expo in Madrid in March 2015. Maduro’s regime advertised the event as a chance to educate Spaniards on “the true reality of Venezuela” and dismantle “the lies of the Spanish press.” The expo was promoted via social media within Spain by members of Podemos, a far-left political party that joined forces with PSOE in 2019 to form Spain’s current coalition government. The Secretary-General of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, has voiced support for Maduro’s regime in Venezuela. Iglesias currently serves as the Second Deputy Prime Minister of Spain.

“Camilo Ibrahim Issa has participated in meetings held by the former head of the Spanish government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, with businessmen linked to the [Bolivarian] revolution,” according to El Mundo. Zapatero is a PSOE member and served two terms as prime minister of Spain from 2004-2011.

“The president of Plus Ultra is a Spaniard named Fernando García Manso who in 2018 thanked the Maduro government in person for the launch of his route, even predicting that ‘one day we will be able to return the favor,'” the newspaper noted of Plus Ultra’s debut in Spain.

The Spanish National Assembly investigated both Issa and Plus Ultra president Rodolfo Reyes, a Venezuelan citizen, in 2018 “for their links to the existing corruption schemes around the business of the CLAP subsidized food boxes and the exchange control managed by the government of Nicolás Maduro,” El Mundo recalled. The newspaper referred to a money-laundering network set up by members of Maduro’s regime in 2018 to steal money from a Venezuelan government subsidy program known by its Spanish initials, CLAP.",1
388,Cuban ‘President’ Claims to Earn Doctorate amid Pandemic,"Cuba’s second-in-command, President Miguel Díaz-Canel, claimed to have successfully defended his dissertation this week for a doctorate from the Central University of Las Villas on the topic of “Science- and Innovation-Based Governance System for the Sustainable Development of Cuba.”

Cuba’s supreme ruler is the head of the Communist Party and longtime dictator Raúl Castro. Constitutionally, Castro is both Party head and military commander-in-chief but chose to issue his weakest title, “president,” to Díaz-Canel in 2018, giving the over half-century-old Castro regime a veneer of transition has not materialized in any substantive changes on the island.

Díaz-Canel has crafted a public persona as a scientific mind, claiming a background as an engineer who brings different sensibilities to governing than the former guerrilla fighters and bureaucrats still controlling the island today. His latest alleged academic achievement — at 60 years of age — comes at one of the most turbulent times in the modern history of Cuba, which faces a worsening Chinese coronavirus outbreak, severe food and basic good shortages, and multiple popular pro-democracy movements.

Cubadebate, a state-run propaganda outlet, praised Díaz-Canel on Tuesday for defending his doctoral dissertation “with the modesty and simplicity of a student” before a group of academics from the central Cuban university offering him a degree, who traveled to Havana to listen to his defense. It applauded the leader for allegedly facing the “crude reality” that the Cuban Revolution had failed to create an efficient technology apparatus. The outlet then quoted from Díaz-Canel’s alleged dissertation, which claimed his work was necessary because a “perception” existed that “the human potential and the scientific and technological capacities that the Revolution created have not in a generalized way had the desired practical impact on society and, in particular, the economy.”

Díaz-Canel reportedly objected to this “perception,” not the reality of Cuba’s population living in squalor while the Castro family’s riches grew for decades.

Cubadebate concluded Díaz-Canel “left no question unanswered” on the topic and received the acclaim of the professors.

Díaz-Canel addressed his presumably successful dissertation defense on Thursay, stating, “it’s not about receiving a title, but about applying the knowledge,” without elaborating. Díaz-Canel also tasked the nation’s academics with “focusing on the solution of the problems of the industrial systems in the country and to satisfy the internal market.”

The abrupt announcement of the culmination of what is typically at least three years of academic work conducted full-time by a senior member of a national government recalled similar incidents in other dictatorships, particularly the controversy surrounding former Zimbabwean first lady Grace Mugabe. Mugabe, known as “Gucci Grace” for her extravagant expenditures while husband Robert ruled the country for decades, claimed to have received a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Zimbabwe in 2014, months after enrolling in the program. Following the military intervention that extracted the Mugabes from power, the new government arrested the vice-chancellor of the university, Levi Nyagura, on charges of corruption tied directly to fraudulently awarding Mugabe a doctorate.

The Cuban independent publication 14 y Medio noted the strange timing of Díaz-Canel taking time out of his presidential duties to pursue a doctorate degree: in the middle of a pandemic that has reached record infection rates, while Cubans struggle to find basic foods like chicken and bread in their stores.

Cuba documented 816 cases of Chinese coronavirus on Wednesday and thre deaths, one of the highest one-date rates since the pandemic began. In total, Cuba has documented nearly 70,000 cases of Chinese coronavirus and 408 deaths, numbers that many observers have questioned given the deteriorated state of the Cuban socialist healthcare system and testimony from defecting members of the Cuban slave doctor system who have admitted to documenting false coronavirus testing and treatment abroad.

The Castro regime has focused significantly more on developing coronavirus treatment products to sell abroad than on containing the outbreak at home. Havana claims to have four coronavirus vaccine candidates in development, among which “Soberana 02” is considered the furthest along on the path to approval. On Wednesday, Díaz-Canel boasted that thousands of Cubans would soon be “vaccinated” with Soberana 02 and another candidate, Adbala, despite the products not yet passing Phase III clinical trials. The mass administering of the experimental products, state newspaper Granma claimed, would be the clinical trials. As of Wednesday, the Finlay Vaccine Institute, which is developing the candidates, claimed that 22,000 people in the country had been “immunized,” despite the lack of evidence that the products work.

El director del @FinlayInstituto explica que:

🔹Alrededor de 22 mil personas han sido inmunizadas como parte de la Fase III del ensayo clínico del candidato vacunal #Soberana02, casi la mitad de la población prevista en ese estudio.#CienciaCubana #CubaViva #LaFuerzaDeUnPaís pic.twitter.com/0BExd3FyJ3 — Instituto Finlay de Vacunas (@FinlayInstituto) March 24, 2021

A report from early March revealed that the Cuban government has already begun attempts to convince friendly nations around the world to purchase the products. The Castro regime’s ambassador to Suriname reportedly mentioned the potential of distributing a Cuban-made vaccine candidate in the country during a meeting with representatives in Paramaribo at the time.

Prior to attempts to sell vaccine candidates, the Castro regime had spent much of 2020 promoting the use of antivirals known as interferons to fight coronavirus infections, a method that no other country had adopted on a large scale and the scant scientific evidence suggested had a high success rate. In April 2020, a group of Cuban medical researchers denounced the use of interferons in a statement distributed by the NGO Cuban Prisoners Defenders, warning that it could lead to severe medical problems for patients, particularly those with mild cases of Chinese coronavirus who may recover naturally.

“When the Government of Cuba assures that the Interferon developed in Cuba cures the coronavirus, it is committing a serious crime against world public health, since this drug not only lacks any scientific proof, but also where it has been tested has already given null results of encouragement,” the researchers’ statement read.

As of this month, reports from Cuba surfaced accusing the regime of continuing to force coronavirus patients to ingest interferons as a means of treating respiratory disease.

389,Caruzo: What TPS for Venezuelans Means for Those of Us Still in Venezuela,"CARACAS, Venezuela – The Biden Administration recently provided Temporary Protected Status to approximately 320,000 Venezuelans living in the United States, granting them safe stay in America and allowing them to work.

It’s a welcomed move for Venezuelans living in America, but those like me – still living in Venezuela and wrestling daily against the disastrous and inexorable collapse of Hugo Chavez’s Socialism of the 21st Century – it means a tacit confirmation that things will not improve for us at all. It means that it will all remain as-is and it sends a message that the best course of action is to just escape.

I, by no means, mean ill-wishes or intend to rain on the parade for my fellow 320,000 Venezuelans. I am glad that they will get some proper normalcy with regard to their migrant status. The few Venezuelans that voted for Biden actually got what they were offered during Biden’s campaign – a TPS (or Temporary Protective Status) was the main allure of the Democrats for the admittedly small Venezuelan vote in the U.S. – and yet, such a generous offer didn’t do much to sway Venezuelans from supporting the GOP during these past elections.

The crux of the problem lies in the fact that the letter “T” doesn’t stand for temporary. There are enough precedents of similar TPS decrees that have simply been renewed over and over with time, turning the letter T into a P for perpetual. Why would Venezuela be the sole exception?

This, plus the fact that we’re politically stuck with the Venezuelan “opposition” and the inert Juan Guaidó, means that nothing will change for our once prosperous country. After 22 years of Revolution that encompass two whole thirds of my life under the same regime and the same opposition, I don’t have hope that things will change for the better. Our political crisis is good business for both the regime and the opposition, while we Venezuelan citizens in Venezuela are the ones that have to deal with the consequences.

And while we do so – and while many, without a doubt, are rightfully deserving of the benefits of TPS – there will inevitably be chavistas benefitting from the TPS’ blanket coverage and quasi-perpetual nature.

Many down here feel disgusted at seeing former chavista judges now living in America, offering their paid services to prepare TPS applicants’ paperwork. We’re no strangers to the luxurious and ostentatious life of the Boliburgueses, (Bolibourgeoisie, a portmanteau of the words “Bolivarian” and “bourgeoise”), a nouveau riche caste of corrupt rich socialists and people who made huge money by engaging in shady businesses with the socialist regime of Venezuela, many of whom prefer to live in capitalist Miami than in socialist Caracas.

Their businesses and antics have been well documented over the past years, and often involve laundering money in Miami through the purchase of real estate — properties that they will now be able to enjoy comfortably with the newfound benefits of the TPS.

For one Venezuelan woman who fled to the United States, this meant seeing Octavio Rivero Maita, the chavista man who assaulted and tortured her while kept in a Bolivarian Intelligence Service jail for 40 days for opposing Maduro’s regime, in her new country. Rivero Maita is a potential beneficiary of Biden’s TPS.

For Iván Simonovis, former chief of police in Caracas who is now living in the U.S. after being imprisoned for 15 years, it must’ve been extremely infuriating to see Antonio Amado Molina, the man responsible for his long captivity, casually strolling through the streets of Miami without no care in the world. To this day, many of the men imprisoned alongside Simonovis still remain confined to a cell. Amado Molina can potentially apply for the TPS.

While former Venezuelan socialist diplomat Martin Sanchez now works for Facebook, training the big tech conglomerate’s algorithms that create the narratives and contexts fed to you by the media, I’ve had to spend this week keeping constant watch on our water distribution so that everyone in this building is not left without water, jury-rigging my constantly failing internet connection so that I can submit these lines, carefully measuring what I say online because I am always one tweet or meme away from getting a 20-year “hate speech” sentence here, and skipping a heartbeat at every fluctuation in electric power, because each and every one of them can be a death sentence for my old appliances and computer. Still, all of this pales in comparison to what many face down here. I have much to be thankful for, because some do have it far worse here. I, at least, have food.

It’s not a matter of jealousy or envy towards any of the 320,000 Venezuelans, it’s just that there will be chavistas benefiting from the TPS while my brother who, because of me and what I do, is at constant risk of being victim to the socialist regime’s forced disappearance of family members, which always culminate in torture.

There’s no protected status for him, as neither of us will even get to board a plane without a U.S. visa. I am one of the last fools on the planet still trying to migrate legally, despite how uphill it all has been for me and how difficult my brother’s case is – who, due to his mental condition, is morally under my care, but not legally. As a man who once worked in a consular office for three years, I know a promise I made on my mother’s deathbed doesn’t carry much legal weight when it comes to visa applications, regardless of the country in question.

I am fully aware of the severity of the crisis that is unfolding at the U.S. southern border, and I’m in no way advocating for open borders, nor would I ever, not even when I am part of the worst migrant crisis in the region. According to the Organization of American States, this crisis has already made over 5.4 million Venezuelans leave this socialist paradise, nearly 20 percent of Venezuelans.

But that’s what the TPS means for the people still here. It simply means “flee, because this ain’t gonna change.” The fact that the Cisneros family (who in the past were at odds with Hugo Chávez but then chose to coexist with it the socialist regime for the sake of their business) is now seeking to acquire cheap assets in our destroyed economy is yet another demoralizing confirmation that there is no way out for a Venezuelan citizen other than to escape.

As desperate as I may be to escape from this country, the allure of the Democrats’ TPS does nothing for me, because even though I was young during the Obama/Biden administration, I am fully aware that it was during those eight years that Hugo Chávez (and then Nicolás Maduro) spread their influence throughout the region while they did nothing. Why would things be any different with an even older Biden now as president? It may sound hypocritical, but if this is how things will be, then I want my brother to have the same safety chavistas now have in America.

This perpetual TPS means that we will be stuck with Maduro and the Socialist Party’s usurpation of power, and stuck with Juan Guaidó, for all of eternity — and if that’s the case, then I want no part of it. I’ve already had enough of this socialist disaster that I had no part in creating. I’ve already lost my mother, much of my health, and most of my young years. I don’t want to lose anything else. To feel this demoralized and defeated is a sensation I don’t want in my life, but living in this country infects you with hopelessness on a daily basis.

Congratulations to the beneficiaries of the TPS. Please make the most out of your newfound life in America and be good and respectful to the country that’s now hosting you and your family and their customs. I sincerely hope that none of you or your descendants ever, ever forget why you fled in the first place and risked everything by remaining illegally in the U.S. all this time. I, for one, will never forget who and what I’ve lost to socialism.

390,Top Venezuelan Socialist Propaganda Show Suspended After Staffer Dies of Coronavirus,"Senior Venezuelan socialist regime official Diosdado Cabello canceled this week’s broadcast of his propaganda program, Con el Mazo Dando (“Hitting with the Mallet”), on Wednesday after a staffer died and several others tested positive for Chinese coronavirus.

Cabello officially serves as the first vice president of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), the ruling party, making him the most powerful person in the country after dictator Nicolás Maduro. Law enforcement officials have for years linked Cabello to the illicit drug trade and informants have identified him as the head of the Cartel de los Soles, a multinational cocaine trafficking outfit run out of the Venezuelan military. Cabello denies the claims and has attempted to sue journalists who have reported the evidence against him but lost the lawsuits after failing to disprove the reports. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who Cabello was rumored to have ordered an assassination attempt against, has referred to him as the “Pablo Escobar of Venezuela.”

Cabello reportedly fell ill last summer with Chinese coronavirus, forcing the suspension of his hours-long Wednesday night propaganda extravaganza. He returned to the program in September, having experienced visible weight loss and with notable changes in his voice. He since appears to have made a full recovery.

Cabello announced on Wednesday that the night’s episode of Con el Mazo Dando would not take place.

“Beloved compatriots, after evaluating the [Chinese coronavirus] situation and the loss of our brother Frank Bayola, a fundamental part of [Con el Mazo Dando], in addition to the apparition of a [Chinese coronavirus] outbreak on our team, we decided to suspend the program for the health of all,” Cabello wrote on Twitter. “We shall overcome.”

The government-run program confirmed Bayola’s death on Monday; Venezuelan outlets reported that he died after testing positive for Chinese coronavirus. Bayola was reportedly an “anthropologist” on the show’s “investigative” team who appeared on the show regularly as a commentator, applauding the Maduro regime and joining in attacks on the United States, which the Maduro regime regularly accuses of “economic war” against it.

Cabello dedicated the latest installment of the program on March 17 to urging Venezuelans to take precautions against the Chinese coronavirus.

Con El Mazo Dando #334 #ElCovidNoEsJuegoCuidate https://t.co/MtljfZqRFa — Con el Mazo Dando (@ConElMazoDando) March 18, 2021

Cabello spoke of his personal experience with the virus, crediting his recovery to his own “determination to get ahead.” Cabello addressed his audience in front of a photograph of late dictator Hugo Chávez holding a cross. The episode lasted nearly four hours.

Cabello is the highest-ranking member of the Maduro regime so far to have reportedly tested positive for coronavirus. Shortly before his announcement in July, Cabello canceled his television program and claimed that he was sick with “a strong allergy” and unable to properly host the show.

Venezuela has documented 152,508 cases of coronavirus within its borders and 1,511 deaths as of Wednesday, significantly less than its neighbors. For comparison, neighboring Brazil has documented more cases – over 12 million – than any other country but the United States. Colombia has documented about 2.3 million. Brazil’s and Colombia’s statistics are significantly higher than most of the world’s, though these include questionable numbers like Venezuela’s and other rogue states such as China and Iran, whose case totals experts have also questioned. China and Iran are close allies of the Maduro regime.

Scientists within the country have questioned the regime’s case count, insisting that the numbers looked nothing like the rates of infection in any other country on earth and noting the limited amount of formal PCR testing on patients exhibiting respiratory illness symptoms. The Academy of Physical, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences of Venezuela published a report in May warning that, without precautions, as many as 4,000 people a day could become infected nationwide. Venezuela has endured chronic shortages of nearly every drug in use in the healthcare industry today since at least 2016 and hospitals have limited access to pivotal equipment like respirators, leaving Venezuela particularly vulnerable to severe damage in the face of a highly contagious pandemic.

Following the publication of the report, Diosdado Cabello used his television show to call for government persecution of the scientists involved.

Further evidence has surfaced since then suggesting a much higher rate of infection in Venezuela than the regime has documented. In October, the polling firm Meganálisis found in a survey of Venezuelans nationwide that about 87 percent of people who lived with a person diagnosed with coronavirus said that the alleged coronavirus patient never received a PCR test. Those not confirmed through PCR testing do not appear in Venezuela’s official coronavirus statistics. Nearly 90 percent of those surveyed also said they treated the disease with no help from the government. Venezuela runs on a universal health care system, meaning private medical care is not available.

Maduro’s response to the pandemic has largely been dubious lockdown policies and the promotion of unproven treatments. Unlike anywhere else in the world, Venezuela has endured a “7+7” lockdown policy, meaning a week of strict lockdown followed by loosened restrictions, followed once again by lockdowns. No scientific evidence suggests this unique system prevents infections. Maduro has timed the loosened restrictions with holidays, such as the national Carnaval or the upcoming Holy Week.

Maduro has also promoted the use of ozone, a toxic gas, to treat coronavirus. Maduro opened a “National Ozone Center” in January for this treatment, which requires patients to ingest potentially fatal amounts of ozone, sometimes rectally, presumably to kill the virus. The American Food and Drug Administration has firmly denounced attempts to use ozone to treat coronavirus.

391,Commander: Northern Triangle Migrants Not Facing Systemic Persecution,"The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras do not engage in the kinds of systemic persecution of their citizens that would make them eligible for refugee or asylum status under United States laws, a top U.S. commander recently suggested.

During an underreported exchange at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) questioned Adm. Craig Faller, the U.S. Southern Command leader (SOUTHCOM), about the legal conditions on the ground in the Northern Triangle. This region is comprised of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Cotton asked the SOUTHCOM commander who oversees U.S. military activity in most of Latin America and the Caribbean:

Do the governments of those three [Northern Triangle] countries systematically persecute their own citizens on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, political views, religious belief, or other such categories?

Adm. Faller responded:

I’m in lockstep with our embassies, and we’ve got great diplomats, and we don’t see systematic exploitation. I work with the militaries, and the elements we work with are vetted and trusted, and I find they’re doing the right thing, whether it’s Honduras, Guatemala, or El Salvador.

Sen. Cotton noted that Northern Triangle citizens heading for the U.S. border are “economic migrants” who do not qualify for asylum or refugee status under American law because the governments of their home countries “do not persecute their own citizens systematically.”

Adm. Faller did not push back against Cotton’s characterization of the commander’s response.

To be eligible for asylum or refugee status, a migrant must face systemic persecution based on race, sex, ethnicity, religion, or political views in their home countries, the Arkansas Republican explained, adding:

An economic migrant is not eligible for asylum. They are not eligible for refugee status. Asylum is designed for people like, say a Hong Konger whose student visa expires and doesn’t want to return to Hong Kong now that the Chinese Communist Party has cracked down on that country. The reason we have a crisis that our border is because President Biden and his administration opened the border and ended the policies of the Trump administration that made it clear you could not make the very dangerous journey across Mexico; you could not pay smugglers and traffickers thousands of dollars to get to our southern border and then expect to be let in. If you let them in, more will come. That is why we have a crisis at the border.

Cotton urged President Joe Biden to reimpose the Trump-era border policies that effectively stemmed illegal migration to the U.S.

U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has refused to recognize the surge of migrants at the southern border, particularly comprised of unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle, as a crisis, calling it a “challenge” instead.

Biden border policies, including not expelling unaccompanied children who reach the border, have led to crowded, inhumane conditions in border patrol facilities.

While Republicans blame the Biden measures for the border crisis, noting that it is fueling child sex trafficking, among other problems, the Democrat president blames the previous administration.

Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, who served under Trump, told National Public Radio (NPR) this week that the previous administration warned the Biden folks that dismantling the former president’s immigration policies would trigger problems at the southern border.

Echoing his Salvadoran counterpart on Tuesday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador indicated Tuesday that the Biden administration’s promise of better treatment for migrants is to blame for the border surge.",1
392,"Biden Relying on White House, Not DHS to Deal with Border Crisis","U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials were notably absent from a trip to Guatemala and Mexico made Monday by senior White House officials seeking to hinder the surge of migrants at the southern border, particularly unaccompanied children.

Under the Trump administration, the DHS implemented measures to stem the illegal migrant surge at the southern border after leading negotiations with Mexico and a trio of Central American countries that are a major source of illegal migration.

At least so far, it appears President Joe Biden is relying on the White House and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. State Department to reach agreements with Mexico and Guatemala to curtail the surge of migrants.

Biden is facing intensifying pressure from both sides of the aisle to take more aggressive action to deal with the border crisis. The sitting administration claims the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is only a cyclical challenge.

Special Assistant to the President and Coordinator for the Southwest Border Amb. Roberta Jacobson, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for the Western Hemisphere Juan Gonzalez, and the newly-appointed Northern Triangle Special Envoy Ricardo Zuniga from the State Department made the trip to Mexico and Guatemala Monday.

No one from DHS was on the trip, according to a White House statement.

The high-level meetings between the Biden Administration officials and their Mexican and Guatemalan counterparts came as sitting DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas indicated that apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border might hit highs not seen in 20 years.

U.S. officials and their counterparts in Mexico and Guatemala discussed developing “an effective and humane plan of action to manage” the high-levels of migration to the U.S. southern border at the moment, the White House noted in the statement.

The Americans will also “address root causes of migration in the region and build a more hopeful future in the region,” it added.

President Biden wants to implement a multi-year, $4 billion measure to address the root causes of people leaving Central America, but Congress has yet to approve the funds.

President Joe Biden has dismantled some Trump DHS measures, including the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also known as the “Remain in Mexico” program, that requires illegals who arrive at the southern border seeking asylum to wait in Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings.

The Biden Administration also did away with a historic Asylum Cooperative Agreements the Trump DHS signed with Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador that reduced the incentive for migrants to make the dangerous journey to the U.S. by improving access to asylum protections as in their home countries.

However, Biden is turning to a tactic used by former President Donald Trump: outsourcing immigration enforcement to Mexico amid increasing numbers of unaccompanied minors feeding the border crisis.

Critics of the Biden immigration policies, including not expelling unaccompanied children who reach the border, have led to crowded, inhumane conditions in border patrol facilities.

Some Republicans who visited the border recently also said that the Biden policies are fueling child sex trafficking, among other problems.

Former acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, who served under Trump, told National Public Radio (NPR) this week that the previous administration warned the Biden folks that dismantling the former president’s immigration policies would trigger problems on the southern border.

“There is no consequence anymore,” Wolf told NPR. “The administration is treating this as though it’s a capacity issue and not an illegal behavior issue, and that’s a fundamental difference.”

Wolf acknowledged that DHS implemented programs such as “Remain in Mexico,” made asylum agreements with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and stopped allowing unaccompanied children to remain in the U.S. in the wake of the last border crisis in 2019.

Officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a component of DHS, “would tell [the Biden Administration] and, in a sense, warn them, ‘If you remove this … this is the consequence for that. We will see a significant uptick,'” Wolf added.

Echoing Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Tuesday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador indicated that the Biden administration is to blame for the surge at the U.S. southern border.

“Expectations were created that with President Biden’s government, there would be a better treatment of migrants,” López Obrador told reporters. “This has caused Central American migrants, and also from our country, to want to cross the border thinking that it is easier to do so.”",1
393,Merkel Politician Investigated for Money Transfers Dies on Cuba Flight,"BERLIN (AP) – A lawmaker with German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party has died after collapsing on a plane during a flight home to Germany.

Karin Strenz, 53, was flying back from Cuba with her husband, said Eckhardt Rehberg, a fellow lawmaker with their centre-right Christian Democratic Union party, according to news agency dpa.

The plane made an emergency landing in Ireland, but rescuers were unable to save Strenz, Rehberg said late Sunday. It was unclear what the cause of death was or why she had travelled to Cuba.

The German parliament’s lower house, the Bundestag, said Monday she wasn’t travelling on official parliamentary business.

Prosecutors in Schwerin said they had opened an investigation to determine the cause of her death, standard practice in such cases, and would request assistance from Ireland. They said they expect that an autopsy will be conducted in Ireland.

Strenz had been a member of the German parliament since 2009, representing a constituency in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

She didn’t plan to seek re-election in Germany’s Sept. 26 election. Early last year, Strenz and another lawmaker were targeted in raids by prosecutors investigating alleged money transfers from Azerbaijan.",1
394,Joe Biden Appoints Special Envoy to Address Border Surge,"The Biden administration appointed a special envoy Monday to help oversee its efforts to stem the ongoing influx of Central American migrants to the U.S. southern border as it faces bipartisan pressure to address the surge.

The White House remained adamant Monday that the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is “not a crisis” despite photos and videos showing otherwise.

Still, the Biden administration found it necessary to create a new position to help its effort to contain the flood of illegal migrants reaching the United States, particularly unaccompanied children. The U.S. State Department, which will oversee the new envoy, described the move as a high priority.

Nevertheless, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have yet to visit the border.

Biden officials tapped Ricardo Zúñiga to serve as a special envoy for the Northern Triangle, a region comprised of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.

Those three countries have long been the source of a significant portion of illegal migration to the United States.

Last week, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele told Fox News soaring migration levels at the southern border are bad for the U.S. and even worse for Latin America because it extracts the people vital to building the solid financial conditions that would keep them in their home country.

Bukele suggested that current U.S. immigration policies are incentivizing Salvadorans to head to the United States.

Jalina Porter, a spokesperson at State, told reporters Monday:

The special envoy will advise the secretary and acting assistant secretary for the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, coordinate closely with the National Security Council, and oversee the department’s comprehensive effort to manage regional migration and address the root causes of migration.

Zúñiga will engage with governments and non-governmental organizations in the region, including but not limited to Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, on improving conditions in Central America to keep potential migrants in their home country, Porter explained, adding:

[He will also] hold government actors accountable to their commitments to address root causes of migration and to address the increase in arrivals of unaccompanied children at the U.S. southern border. He will also keep congress apprised of our efforts. This is one of our highest priorities.

In a statement announcing the new appointment, the State Department stressed that Zúñiga would help oversee “the administration’s comprehensive efforts to stem irregular migration to the United States.”

He will also help implement Biden’s multi-year, $4 billion measure to address root causes of why people leave Central America.

Congress has yet to approve the $4 billion effort, “a potentially difficult process as Biden’s immigration bill faces opposition in both chambers,” the Hill noted.

In 2019, El Salvador’s president said he favors jumpstarting private commerce between the United States and El Salvador and improving conditions to prevent Salvadorans from leaving over U.S.-taxpayer-funded foreign aid “handouts.”

Unlike the previous administration, the Biden administration prohibits press requests to visit the detention centers and overcrowded processing centers holding children to take pictures or tour the facilities.

Some videos and photos have recently surfaced on social media, courtesy of U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-TX) and James O’Keefe. The videos and photos show the deplorable, overcrowded conditions of migrant children held in South Texas, with kids forced to sleep on floor mats amid a worsening humanitarian crisis.

Republicans, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and others who visited the border recently, have stressed the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border is nothing short of heartbreaking.

Addressing the Hispanic American community, some Latino Republican lawmakers have emphasized that the surge fuels child sex trafficking and forced labor, and many girls are raped on their dangerous journey up north.

At the height of a similar surge of unaccompanied children in June 2018, the Trump administration allowed the media and Congress members to tour the facilities holding the kids, giving Democrats the opportunity to criticize the former president’s immigration policy.

Leftist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) went as far as accusing former President Trump of running “concentration camps” at the border and locking children in “cages.” She has remained mostly quiet during the ongoing crisis.

A career member of the senior foreign service, “Zúñiga has served in a number of posts in Latin America and also served as senior director for Western Hemisphere Affairs at the National Security Council under former President Obama,” the Hill pointed out.",1
395,Mexico Deploys 8700 Troops to Cut Migrant Traffic to U.S. Border,"Mexico deployed 8,715 soldiers to stop the flow of migrants to the U.S. border, according to new federal disclosures. The move comes as U.S. immigration authorities struggle to absorb the rising number of Central American migrants entering that country.

During a news conference, Secretary of Defense Luis Cresencio Sandoval said the military set up 347 immigration checkpoints in Mexico along three main routes (Gulf, Center, Pacific). According to Sandoval, military forces had already “rescued” 12,905 migrants in March. Sandoval did not specify if the migrants were simply apprehended or if they were being held involuntarily by human smuggling organizations.

Sandoval’s announcement comes at the same time that U.S. President Joe Biden announced a diplomatic delegation to Mexico to discuss the ongoing immigration crisis.

After experiencing the start of a surge in migrants, Mexico deployed close to 1,000 National Guardsmen and members of the National Immigration Institute to its southern border in January. That move has proven largely inconsequential since migrants continue to reach Mexican northern states like Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon. In recent weeks, authorities in Mexico raided hotels and stash houses. Officials also stopped large groups of migrants stuffed in tractor-trailers.

396,Bolivia: Conservative Ex-President on Hunger Strike,"Former Bolivian President Jeanine Áñez declared herself on hunger strike this weekend and, according to her family, has been denied transfer to a medical facility despite rapidly declining health. Officials did transfer her to a new prison in the early hours of Sunday, outraging supporters.

Áñez is facing dubious charges of “terrorism” and “sedition” for having assumed the presidency in an emergency situation in November 2019. Socialist former President Evo Morales resigned that month after 14 years in power following a report from the Organization of American States (OAS) showing evidence of voter fraud led to his alleged win in the October presidential election. Morales was constitutionally term-limited from running in the race, but successfully sued to be on the ballot, claiming term limits are a human rights violation.

In response to the OAS report, Morales and most of the senior leadership of his party, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS), fled the country. Áñez, then a conservative senior senator, was the highest-ranking person left in the country on the constitutional line of succession, obligating her to assume the presidency.

Áñez organized a free and fair election last year, in which she did not partake, where MAS candidate Luis Arce emerged as the victor. The MAS government has since declared Morales’ voluntary resignation a “coup” and imprisoned Áñez on charges of organizing the false coup to seize power. Bolivian judges have sentenced her to at least four months of “preventative” time in prison after designating her a flight risk.

Áñez was arrested last week. Sources close to her notified Bolivian media Friday that she had “chosen to cease feeding herself” as a form of protest for her arrest.

“She is on hunger strike. I found her in very bad condition. ‘Why struggle? Why live?’ she told me,” Amparo Carvajal, the head of the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights, told El Deber, a Bolivian newspaper.

Áñez’s attorneys demanded the government offer her medical care outside of prison, prompting a weekend tug-of-war among various judges approving and overturning the request for health care. On Saturday, Áñez’s representatives presented to the court presiding over her case testimony from her doctor confirming that, at 53 and with a record of high blood pressure, Áñez faces a high risk of experiencing systemic arterial hypertension that may put her life at risk. One judge, Armando Zeballos, ordered Áñez to be moved to a healthcare facility in light of her medical state, but prison officials refused. Instead, they moved her to another prison in between Saturday night and Sunday morning.

Áñez’s daughter, Carolina Ribera, told Bolivian media outlets prior to her mother’s transfer that medical workers in the first prison were treating Áñez’s high blood pressure with short-term medications, not addressing her condition properly.

“What they do is inject her medicine intravenously to lower her blood pressure and in a little while it goes up again and they inject her again,” Ribera said, “that is how they are keeping her and I will continue to demand her transfer to a clinic to be treated appropriately.”

Ribera insists that the Zeballos order to move Áñez to a hospital remains in vigor and no judge has overturned it, meaning the government has chosen to simply ignore it.

The official in charge of Áñez’s transfer, identified by El Deber as Juan Carlos Limpias, insisted to reporters that the late-night transfer was precisely in response to concerns about her health, without clarifying why officials moved her to another prison as opposed to a clinic.

Áñez’s legal team announced Sunday a new request to the United Nations and the Interamerican Commission on Human Rights to intervene, using in part Ribera’s testimony outlining the abuses the former president has faced since her arrest. In addition to violations of her right to medical care, Ribera contended in the complaint to the international institutions that the individuals who arrested Áñez were not law enforcement officers, but rather “civilians with no identification who were sent via direct order from President Luis Arce.”

A Bolivian feminist NGO, the Judicial Office for Women, denounced the socialist government’s treatment of Áñez on Monday as “torture [and] cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment as recognized and prohibited by the Constitution of the State [Bolivia], the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention Against Torture of the United Nations, the American Convention on Human Rights, and the Convention [Against] Violence Against Women.”

Among the individual instances of alleged torture described are solitary confinement, lack of due process, and denial of proper medical care.

Arce’s government has avoided any significant statements on the Áñez case at press time. Morales, who returned to Bolivia after Arce won the presidency, attacked not the arrest, but OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro for issuing a statement of concern regarding Áñez’s physical state following her arrest.

Almagro’s declarations are a new attempt against democracy,” Morales claimed, accusing Áñez of participating in alleged “massacres.”

In reality, the violence following Morales’ voluntary resignation was largely the product of Morales, from self-imposed exile in Mexico, inciting violent socialists to take the streets. Mobs of angry radical left agents chanting slogans like “here we go, civil war” flooded Bolivia’s major cities in late 2019, attacking police officers and civilians. Law enforcement authorities recorded a conversation Morales himself allegedly had with a union leader while out of the country in which he instructed the union leader to organize blockades meant to starve urban people.

“Don’t let food into the cities,” the voice allegedly belonging to Morales said.

397,‘Conservative’ President of Colombia Allows Broadcast of Xi Jinping Speech,"President Iván Duque of Colombia, a self-proclaimed conservative and stern critic of Chinese allies in Latin America like Venezuela, allowed Chinese dictator Xi Jinping to broadcast a speech directly to the Colombian people Sunday.

Xi addressed Colombia on the occasion of the arrival of 774,320 doses of “Coronavac,” a Chinese coronavirus vaccine developed by the Chinese firm Sinovac. Coronavac is believed to be the least effective of the vaccines and vaccine candidates against the Chinese coronavirus currently circulating on an international scale, testing at a 50-percent efficacy rate in preventing coronavirus infections compared to the over 90-percent success of American vaccines.

The Chinese Communist Party has experienced significant success in selling “Coronavac” to Latin America, expanding into the markets of Chile and Brazil, the latter after conservative President Jair Bolsonaro initially canceled an order of Coronavac doses made by a state governor. Chile, which has relied heavily on Coronavac, is currently experiencing its most severe wave of coronavirus infections since the pandemic began despite widely outpacing vaccinations elsewhere in the continent.

According to China’s Global Times state propaganda outlet, Xi used his address to the Colombian people to boast that, under self-proclaimed conservative leadership, China had risen to be Colombia’s second-largest trade partner, threatening to dominate the nation’s economy.

“Xi said he hopes that the governments and peoples of the two countries will make joint efforts to strengthen friendly cooperation in various fields including the anti-pandemic fight, so as to elevate China-Colombia friendly cooperation to a new level from a new historical starting point and bring more benefits to the two peoples,” the Global Times reported.

The vaccines arriving from China in Colombia on Saturday are the third shipment from Beijing. The details of the agreement for the vaccine distribution, including the exact price and other commitments, remain unclear at press time.

Duque also made some remarks during the broadcast carrying Xi’s speech, thanking the Chinese Communist Party and Xi for his words and hoping that bilateral ties “grow stronger and more solid day by day, that they allow the free flow of information and good experience as well as scientific information.”

Colombia has one of the highest rates of coronavirus infection in the world, having documented 2.3 million cases within its borders as of Monday. Doctors have determined 62,028 people have died as a result of coronavirus infections since the pandemic began in Colombia.

“Coronavac” has become one of the world’s most administered coronavirus vaccines despite its poor performance. While the Chinese government attempted to claim that it was much more effective initially than studies ended up proving, the results of Phase III clinical trials in Brazil showed only a 50.38-percent efficacy rate in preventing infections. Chinese state media outlets defended the vaccine on the grounds that it was significantly more effective in preventing severe cases of coronavirus that require hospitalization and thus has the ability to save lives.

The Sinovac product has been the backbone of Chile’s vaccination program, which as of last week has resulted in at least one-third of the nation’s population receiving at least one dose of a vaccine against the Chinese coronavirus. Chile is the most vaccinated country in Latin America has one of the highest rates of vaccination against coronavirus in the world. The country received 4 million doses of Coronavac in February.

Despite the mass vaccination campaign, Chile’s rates of infection have skyrocketed in the past week, leading observers to describe it as undergoing a “far more aggressive” second wave with the vaccine than its first wave of cases when the pandemic began. Doctors confirmed 7,084 cases of coronavirus Saturday, the highest number of cases recorded in a single day in the country.

The center-right government of Chile confirmed last week that it has contracted with the American company Pfizer to import 150,000 doses of its coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer’s vaccine tested at a 95-percent efficiency rate in preventing coronavirus infections.

Chile, a country of about 19 million, has documented 931,939 cases of Chinese coronavirus since the pandemic began and 22,279 deaths.

Brazil, whose Butantan Institute hosted clinical studies for Coronavac, has documented the second-highest number of Chinese coronavirus cases in the world, not counting for mounting evidence that suggests rogue states like China, Russia, and Iran have grossly underestimated the number of cases within their borders. Nearly 12 million people have tested positive for coronavirus in Brazil and nearly 300,000 have died.

Despite repeatedly insisting he would not import vaccine candidates from China, President Jair Bolsonaro announced in January that his government had contracted with Sinovac, the company that makes Coronavac, to mass import ingredients to make the vaccine at home. Bolsonaro added that his country had also contracted with the Swedish company Astra-Zeneca for ingredients to make its vaccine, now under scrutiny after mounting concerns about blood clots.

“I appreciate the sensibility of the Chinese government, as well as the effort of the ministers of [the Foreign Ministry], [Foreign Minister] Ernesto Araujo, [Health Minister] Eduardo Pazuello, and [Agriculture Minister] Tereza Cristina [Corrêa da Costa Dias],” Bolsonaro said in a statement on Twitter.

398,Pope Francis Appeals for End to Violence in Paraguay,"ROME — Pope Francis called for peace in Paraguay on Wednesday as protests over surging coronavirus cases and political corruption have met with violence.

Following his weekly General Audience, the pope said he has been “concerned about the news from Paraguay,” with demonstrators demanding the impeachment of President Mario Abdo Benítez over his perceived mishandling of the health crisis.

“Through the intercession of Our Lady of Miracles of Caacupé, I ask the Lord Jesus, Prince of Peace, that a path of sincere dialogue may be found to find adequate solutions to the present difficulties, and thus build together the longed-for peace,” the pontiff told viewers following his streamed address from the library of the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican.

“Let us remember that violence is always self-destructive,” Francis declared. “Nothing is gained through it, but much is lost, sometimes everything.”

Political corruption and unrest are a way of life in Paraguay, with the ruling Colorado party in power almost exclusively over the last 70 years, which included a military coup in 1989 and a failed coup attempt in 1996.

A recent surge in coronavirus cases in the land-locked country combined with a glacially slow vaccine rollout has sparked anti-Abdo protests that have at times turned violent. For their part, police have responded with water cannons and rubber bullets.

Pope Francis traveled to Paraguay in July 2015 and during his visit he acknowledged Paraguay’s troubled and often violent history.

“From the first days of the country’s independence to recent times, Paraguay has known the terrible sufferings brought on by war, fratricidal conflict, lack of freedom and contempt for human rights,” the pope said at the time. “How much suffering and death!”

Francis commended the Paraguayan people for their “admirable spirit of perseverance in surmounting adversities and in working to build a prosperous and peaceful nation” while urging citizens to learn from their past so as not to repeat its errors.

“A people which forgets its own past, its history and its roots, has no future, it is a dull people,” he said. “Memory, if it is firmly based on justice and rejects hatred and all desire for revenge, makes the past a source of inspiration for the building of a future of serene coexistence.”

“It also makes us realize the tragedy and pointlessness of war,” he said. “Let there be an end to wars between brothers!”

“Let us always build peace!” he urged. “A peace which grows stronger day by day, a peace which makes itself felt in everyday life, a peace to which each person contributes by seeking to avoid signs of arrogance, hurtful words, contemptuousness, and instead by working to foster understanding, dialogue and cooperation.”

399,Charles Hurt: The Millionaire Bidens’ Incredible White Privilege,"Poor Joe Biden.

For nearly five decades, Mr. Biden has been getting everything wrong in Washington. He has always been a low-watt thinker with verbal dysentery.

But harmless.

Which is why he wound up as vice president in the first place — White Privilege Joe.

Poor guy, he is so slow he was the last person to realize that nobody took him seriously. He thought all the eye-rolls were just how everybody said: “Yeah, Joe, we love hearing the sound of your voice as much as you do!”

Droning on and on, the insufferable loquacity would have shamed even the Great Buffoon himself, John Kerry.

But if you are dumb enough, extravagantly ineffective, and willing to blow with any wind, you can make yourself quite a living in Washington.

Joe Biden might have arrived in Washington a half-century ago as “Middle-Class Joe.” But he is “Millionaire Joe” today. So is his dirtbag junkie son, Hunter.

White Privilege pays, baby! It might even make you the king.

The problem with blowing with the wind and running off with every loud mob is that you just never know when and where the mob might turn next. Especially if you were never all that swift to begin with.

This perhaps explains Mr. Biden’s obsession with saying the word “smart.”

Mr. Biden’s junkie son Hunter is “the smartest guy I know,” claims the elder Mr. Biden. That very well may be possible. After all, he has lived in Washington since before the invention of color television.

But Hunter is “the smartest guy I know” also sounds like something the family therapist suggested Mr. Biden say during their last junkie intervention after Hunter got strung out smoking cheese whiz in a crack pipe. I mean, there really was not any other positive reinforcement Mr. Biden could offer.

“Gee, son, you are the best at not sleeping with your dead brother’s widow,” was obviously not an option.

Neither was, “Man, you are so good at not grifting millions from corrupt foreign governments off your daddy’s name.”

Nor was, “Hey, kid, nobody is better at ignoring his illegitimate child in his memoir.” Okay, well at least that last one would have been actually true.

Now Mr. Biden tells residents of the Great State of Georgia that they need to “smarten up.” Now take that with a grain of salt. It’s entirely possible that Mr. Biden simply means Georgians should take up smoking cheese whiz from a crack pipe.

Mr. Biden was talking about the new Georgia legislation requiring people to present valid identification in order to vote in elections — obviously a racist attack on Black people.

We are talking fire hoses, snarling German Shepherds, and insurmountable poll tests. “Jim Crow on steroids,” Mr. Biden said — in all seriousness.

On second thought, it is entirely possible that Joe Biden’s deadbeat junkie son really is the smartest person Joe Biden knows.

400,Illegal Alien Accused of Murdering His Neighbor After Suing Police,"An illegal alien stands accused of murdering his neighbor in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Chicago, Illinois, after suing the city’s police department for including him in a “gang database” of suspects.

Luis Pedrote Salinas, a 30-something illegal alien, has been arrested and charged after allegedly murdering his next-door neighbor, 41-year-old Francisco Zamora, in the victim’s home this month.

According to authorities, Zamora was walking into his Chicago home as Salinas stood in front of him and shot him at point-blank range in the head. Salinas was so close to Zamora when he shot him, authorities said, that gunpowder was found around the entrance of the victim’s home.

Later, authorities said Zamora’s wife and daughter found his body. Zamora’s son told authorities he looked out a window of their home and saw a man who resembled Salinas leaving the scene of the crime.

Soon after, when authorities went to interview him, Salinas was seen with a gun and injured three Chicago police officers after resisting them. While taking Salinas into custody, authorities discovered a passport, a phone, two duffle bags, and cocaine in his car.

Shell-casings from the scene of the murder, authorities allege, match those from Salinas’ gun. He has since been charged with first-degree murder, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon, possession of a controlled substance, and felony resisting police. Salinas is being held without bail.

In July 2017, Salinas sued the Chicago Police Department, along with other illegal aliens, claiming he was falsely accused by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency of being a gang member charging that he was only put in ICE’s gang database because of his race and ethnicity.

The lawsuit was dismissed in November 2020.

Salinas was arrested in 2010 for battery, in 2011 for having an unopened alcoholic beverage in his car when police stopped him, and then again in 2015 for aggravated assault. Months after the 2011 arrest, ICE agents raided Salinas’ home and arrested him for his alleged ties to a Chicago gang.

By February 2012, Salinas was released from ICE custody on a $3,000 bail and received orders for voluntary deportation to occur in July 2012.

Salinas has repeatedly attempted to gain immigration relief to permanently stay in the U.S. In 2014 and 2015, Salinas applied for former President Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program but was denied both times.

In 2012, Salinas tried to obtain a U visa by claiming he was the victim in an armed robbery while working at a Subway restaurant.

401,George Floyd Family Atty Crump: ‘Confident in My Heart That There Will Be a Conviction of Derek Chauvin’,"Friday on CNN’s “New Day,” Benjamin Crump, George Floyd’s family lawyer, predicted Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin would be convicted for Floyd’s death while under arrest.

Crump said he is “confident” Chauvin will be convicted but cautioned that “the American legal system has broken my heart before.”

CNN’s Erica Hill asked, “What are you expecting from the defense?”

“Well, I think we’ve seen much of it,” Crump replied. “They are going to do everything possible, Erica, here to distract us. They say, ‘Look over here at this angry crowd,’ trying to suggest, ‘Look at these angry black people. That’s the reason why Derek Chauvin kept his knee on his neck.’ And then they are saying, ‘Oh, it’s the paramedics’ fault. They’re blaming everybody else. They’re saying, ‘Oh, the trace amount of drugs, his health condition.’ And that’s why we’re so grateful that Dr. Tobin was so effective in presenting his testimony that it completely destroyed the defense’s theory that George Floyd died as a result of trace amounts of drugs or health condition because he said unequivocally that a healthy person enduring what George Floyd had to endure would have died as well.”

He added, “And so I expect, and I am confident in my heart, that there will be a conviction of Derek Chauvin being criminally liable for killing George Floyd, but the American legal system has broken my heart before.”

402,Democrat Ro Khanna Slams Biden's Defense Spending Increase Proposal,"Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), the progressive caucus deputy whip, on Friday slammed President Joe Biden’s proposed defense spending increase.

Biden unveiled his “skinny” budget proposal that outlines his priorities as Congress prepares to start the annual appropriations process later this spring. The “skinny” budget calls for $1.52 trillion in spending and, if passed, would drastically increase domestic spending on health care, coronavirus-related programs, and other social welfare programs.

Khanna, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, contended that the Biden budget proposal fails to return to the Obama-era defense spending levels. The budget would provide a 1.7 percent boost to military spending.

He said:

At a time when his own Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, recently criticized a federal budget that is basically ‘military and pensions’ without building our productivity capability here at home, it’s disappointing that President Biden would propose a budget of $715 billion for the Pentagon, an increase of 1.6% over Trump’s $704 billion budget, instead of working toward returning to the Obama-Biden era spending levels. I am pleased to see that the proposal eliminates the overseas contingency operations (OCO) slush fund, but I am concerned that this budget will likely include other wasteful spending such as funding the new GBSD ICBM missiles that will cost almost $100B (over 10 years).

Lisa Gilbert, the executive vice president of the left-leaning Public Citizen, praised the budget’s focus on increasing domestic spending rather than feeding the “military-industrial complex.”

She said, “As Congress moves forward with this guidance for appropriating, they still have time to adjust the budget and meet true human needs rather than blindly fulfill demands from the military-industrial complex and its lobbyists.

“We need a fundamental shift in how we address national security issues and invest in climate action and pandemic response,” the California progressive said. “Those are the issues impacting the security of the American people and will keep Americans safer than spending billions on more deadly weapons.”",1
403,African Cardinal Urges Christians to ‘Rebel’ Against Same-Sex Marriage,"Cardinal Philippe Ouédraogo of Burkina Faso called on Christian families this weekend to “rebel” against LGBT lobbies that wish to “impose same-sex marriage” on the world.

“While adopting the positive values ​​of modernity, as active agents of the future of the world, African Christian families should rebel against the imperialism of certain lobbies and associations that advocate and want to impose same-sex marriage,” said Cardinal Ouédraogo, Metropolitan Archbishop of Ouagadougou, in his Easter homily.

The cardinal’s words came in the wake of a Vatican declaration banning Catholic clergy from granting blessings to same-sex couples, a measure that has generated consternation among progressive clergy and laity especially in the German-speaking world.

Speaking during the Easter vigil at the Cathedral of Ouagadougou, the cardinal also reaffirmed the Church’s teaching on the indissolubility of Christian marriage as well as its opposition to polygamy and adultery.

Ouédraogo went on to condemn the “insidious imposition” of anti-natalist programs and abortion on African nations.

“Every Christian should, like Saint Joseph, be welcoming to human life, be open to it and protect it,” he declared.

“The ultimate witness incumbent on all Christians in this society involves seeking the things that are above and not those of the earth, which are ephemeral,” he said.

The Biden administration recently announced that it will reintroduce countries’ abortion policy as part of the State Department’s annual survey of global human rights, reversing a decision by the Trump administration.

As part of the official U.S. human rights program, the State Department will resume the practice of the Obama administration of pressing countries to legalize abortion and same-sex marriage, a position that has angered Africans who view the measure as an imposition of Western values.

When President Biden reinstated taxpayer-funded abortions abroad, repealing the Mexico City policy, African human rights activists warned of a neo-colonialist push to force Africans to abandon their values, which include appreciation for every human life including the unborn.

A group called Culture of Life Africa released a video titled “A Message for President Biden,” which begins: “We appeal to Joe Biden, please do not, do not, do not, sponsor abortion in Africa.”

“We all deserve the right to live. I stand against the funding of abortion in Africa,” declares another speaker.

Nigerian human rights activist Obianuju Ekeocha, a biomedical scientist and author, also decried President Biden’s overturning of the Mexico City policy, especially as it affects Africa.

“The experts in the halls of Western power disregard the views and the values of an entire nation in order to push their pro-abortion agenda,” Ekeocha stated in her 2018 book Target Africa: Ideological Neocolonialism in the Twenty-First Century.

“At the core of my people’s value system is the profound recognition that human life is precious, paramount, and supreme,” she stated. “For us, abortion, which is the deliberate killing of little ones in the womb, is a direct attack on innocent human life. It is a serious injustice, which no one should have the right to commit.”

Unfortunately, Ekeocha observed, in their efforts to impose an abortion culture, those in the West care little for what Africans want.

“It is time for the international community to listen to the voices of the African people and to desist from pushing abortion on them,” she declared.

The financing of abortion in Africa, Ekeocha notes, is part of a larger war on the African people. “Western nations, organizations, and foundations wage war against the bodies of African women” in a frontal attack on “female fertility,” she says.

“The insistence on reducing the population of Africa, no matter what the cost to the Africans themselves, is racism, imperialism, and colonialism disguised as philanthropy,” she states.

405,"Report: Ethiopia, Eritrea Starving out Ethnic Minority Region","A report published Tuesday alleges Ethiopian federal troops and allied Eritrean army soldiers have committed “starvation crimes” as a military tactic in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region over the past several months.

“The sole reason for the scale of the humanitarian emergency” in Ethiopia’s Tigray region currently “is that the coalition of Ethiopian Federal forces, Amhara regional forces, and Eritrean troops are committing starvation crimes on large scale,” the report, published by Tufts University’s World Peace Organization on April 6, states.

The Ethiopian federal government has been engaged in a military stand-off with the separatist Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) since November 4, when Addis Ababa accused TPLF forces of attacking a federal military base in Tigray. Over 60,000 Ethiopians have fled the fighting, either for other parts of Ethiopia or neighboring states, such as Sudan. The conflict has created a new hunger crisis in the region, as many of the refugees have no access to food. Ethiopian and Eritrean soldiers are responsible for precipitating this hunger crisis through their systematic “starvation crimes,” which include looting grain stores and intentionally burning harvests, the new report alleges.

Fighting across Tigray has damaged most of the region’s energy sources and left the area under an electricity blackout. The lack of power means that mechanical grain mills are down.

“Even if farmers have grains, in many villages and towns, there are no operating mills,” Belgian professor and geographer Jan Nyssen told the authors of the report in late January. “Thus people can’t make bread or tayta (fermented flatbread) and many are living on roasted barley and whatever else they can find.”

“Traditional grinding is done between two stones shaped for that purpose, but many homesteads do not have such stones anymore, as mechanized grain mills have been built all over the place. The situation is even more difficult for the internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have no way to obtain such grinding stones,” Nyssen said.

“Two sources tell us that people go to the bushes and collect branches and leaves of non-toxic thirst-quenching plants such as sorrel (Rumex nervosus) in order to have at least something in their stomachs. In some places there are not even matches available to light a fire for cooking,” he added.

The paper cited instances of looting, considered an act that contributes to a starvation crime in Ethiopia, from a February report by Amnesty International, which detailed an attack on the city of Aksum by Eritrean soldiers from November 28-29.

“Residents said Eritrean soldiers stole sugar and flour from a store called Guna Trading; that they robbed May Akko, a large community store, of truckloads of sugar, cooking oil and lentils; that they took flour and animal fodder from the Dejen Flour Factory, and that they looted the budget student grocery store of the university,” Amnesty International reported on February 26.

According to the World Peace Organization report:

Article 270 of the Ethiopian Penal Code of 2004 is concerned with ‘war crimes against the civilian population’. Paragraph (i) specifically prohibits ‘the confiscation, destruction, removal, rendering useless or appropriation of property such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of food stuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works, health centres, schools.’ Additionally, Article 273 prohibits pillage, piracy and looting.

“Intentionally using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival, including wilfully impeding relief supplies as provided for under the Geneva Conventions” constitutes a war crime in international armed conflicts, according to the International Criminal Court.",1
407,"Nigeria: Nearly 2,000 ‘Deadly Criminals’ Escape in Explosive Prison Break","Heavily armed militants attacked a prison facility in Nigeria’s southeastern city of Owerri on Monday, allowing nearly 2,000 inmates to escape.

Armed gunmen stormed the Owerri prison on April 5 at around 2:15 a.m., according to the Nigerian Correctional Service. Some militants used explosives and rocket-propelled grenades to detonate sections of the building.

“The Owerri Custodial Centre in Imo state has been attacked by unknown gunmen and forcefully released a total of 1,844 inmates in custody,” a spokesman for the Nigerian prison service said in a statement Monday.

“The attackers who stormed the facility … gained entrance into the yard by using explosives to blast the administrative block,” Nigerian Correctional Service Spokesman Francis Enobore said. “They were said to have arrived [at] the center in their large number in several Hilux pick-up vans and Sienna buses armed with sophisticated weapons and immediately engaged the security personnel on duty in a fierce gun battle. They eventually detonated the explosive to gain entrance.”

The Nigerian Police Force said Monday the gunmen also attempted to infiltrate the force’s headquarters and armory, but that police officers successfully thwarted the attack. The militants were armed with “sophisticated weapons such as General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs), Sub-Machine Guns (SMGs), AK49 rifles, Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPGs), [and] Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs).”

The Nigerian Police Force said it believes the attackers were members of an outlawed Nigerian separatist group known as the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The Nigerian government designated the IPOB as an official terror organization in 2017. The IPOB demands independence for a region of southeastern Nigeria it calls Biafra. A 1967-1970 civil war between Biafra secessionists and the Nigerian federal government killed one million people.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari condemned the attack on Owerri prison on Monday as “an act of terrorism” in a statement released by his spokesman on April 5.

“The President directed security and intelligence agencies in the state and the geo-political zone to fully mobilize and go after the terrorists, apprehend them and get them punished under the full weight of the law,” the statement read. “He also called for the best efforts to be made to rearrest fleeing prison detainees, many of whom are believed to be deadly criminals.”

IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu denied the group’s involvement in the prison attack in a statement to CNN on April 6.

“We have no hand in what transpired in Owerri, Imo State,” Kanu told the U.S.-based news outlet.",1
409,France Opens Archives on Rwandan Genocide,"(AFP) — The French government on Wednesday ordered the opening up of significant state archives concerning the Rwandan genocide, on the 27th anniversary of the start of the slaughter that still casts a shadow over France.

The archives concern the work of former president Francois Mitterrand and his prime minister Edouard Balladur between 1990 and 1904 when the Rwandan genocide began, according to a statement issued in France’s official journal which publishes government decrees.

Many of the documents — which include diplomatic telegrams and confidential notes — were sources for a long-awaited report by historians published late last month over France’s role in the genocide.

The genocide saw around 800,000 mainly people slaughtered, mainly from the ethnic Tutsi minority, between April and July of 1994.

Five Alleged Rwandan Genocide Perpetrators Live Openly in Britain, Four on State Welfare https://t.co/uFrTrBBx31 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 23, 2020

A commission set up by President Emmanuel Macron concluded that France bears overwhelming responsibilities over the genocide and was “blind” to preparations for the massacres.

Its report published last month said there had been a “failure” on the part of France under Mitterrand, while adding there was no evidence Paris was complicit in the killings.

Macron ordered the report after years of accusations France did not do enough to halt the massacres and was even complicit in the crimes.

The issue still poisons modern relations between France and Rwanda under its President Paul Kagame, a former Tutsi rebel who has ruled the mountainous nation in Africa’s Great Lakes region since the aftermath of the genocide.

The Elysee said it hoped the report would mark an “irreversible” reconciliation process between France and Rwanda, which Macron has said he wants to visit this year.

Rwanda described the report as “an important step toward a common understanding of France’s role in the genocide against the Tutsi”.

410,Nigerian Cardinal Joins Bishop’s Critique of Buhari Government,"Nigeria’s highest ranking Catholic prelate has come to the defense of the bishop of Sokoto, accused by the Buhari government of playing “partisan politics.”

Cardinal John Onaiyekan (pictured), the emeritus Archbishop of Abuja, said on television Monday no one can stop the Bishop of Sokoto, Matthew Kukah, from speaking against bad governance in the country.

A spokesman for President Muhammadu Buhari described Bishop Kukah’s Easter Sunday homily as ungodly, accusing him of playing partisan politics by criticizing the government’s ineffective response to Islamic terrorism in the country.

“With all due respect to whoever is speaking for the Presidency, he has a wrong idea of politics,” Cardinal Onaiyekan said in response.

“Does that mean that whenever we (religious leaders) tell the truth and work to make our country better, we should shut up because we are playing politics? No, we refuse. We will continue to talk,” the cardinal said.

“Kukah is not preparing a coup against Buhari,” Onaiyekan said. “He is only concerned about the people he sees every day. Kukah is speaking for so many who do not have a voice.”

“What we expected from the Presidency was to hear what Kukah had to say and take the issues one-by-one; maybe give explanations, if there is a need for such, and hopefully consider considering his message in its future plans,” Onaiyekan said.

Speaking to the issue of granting amnesty to bandits and terrorists, Onaiyekan said the move only breeds more criminality.

“We should be telling bandits and terrorists: ‘Go and sin no more,’” he said. “We cannot in any way give them the impression that they are doing the right things.”

In his response, the cardinal echoed the critique offered by Bishop Kukah on Sunday.

“All the question of easy amnesty, under the pretense that they have repented, and spending money on them is sad, especially when we say we have no money to spend on the victims,” Onaiyekan said.

“Kids’ glove treatment of criminals boils down to bribing them to keep calm because the causes of criminality and insecurity will still be there,” he continued. “The more you treat criminals this way; the more others will come out so that they too can come to get the same treatment.”

“We made it clear that unless the injustices are addressed, there is no room for peace,” he said. “It is only when you address the injustice that you can now sit down for peace,” he said.

Onaiyekan also said that pockets of agitation against the government are “cries of anguish” stemming from the widespread situation of insecurity.

“With what we have now, there is no way you can excuse the authorities,” he said. “The first duty of the government is the security of lives and properties.”

“The separatist agitations across the country are cries of despair. If you cannot trust the government to protect you, where do you go?” he added.

“Government has not told us they are unable to protect us even though they have sometimes in the past told us to defend ourselves but how are we supposed to do that? So, the agitation for separation is simply a cry of anguish,” he said.

The cardinal concluded by urging the government to stop issuing statements and start taking effective action against the terror.

“We don’t need a powerful president, but a safer nation,” he said.

“They have the responsibility to do something,” he said. “We are tired of hearing beautiful words from rulers.”

411,Nigerian Bishop’s Critique of Government Sparks President’s Ire,"Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari lashed out at the Catholic bishop of Sokoto Monday for criticizing his government’s response to Islamic terrorism in the country.

During his homily on Easter Sunday, Sokoto Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah said that “insecurity, in particular terrorism, has degenerated since President Buhari came to power in 2015,” an assertion that provoked a swift response from President Buhari.

The bishop lamented the neglect of Boko Haram victims by the Buhari administration while “repentant” Boko Haram insurgents are rehabilitated and freed.

“The nation has since become a massive killing field, as both government and the governed look on helplessly,” the bishop said in his homily.

“Mysteriously, the government is investing billions of naira [the local currency] in rehabilitating so-called Boko Haram repentant members and their other partners in crime, in the belief that they want to turn a new leaf,” Kukah said.

The legislature in Nigeria called for ""chopping off the genitals"" of convicted rapists on Wednesday amid a surge in rapes nationwide. https://t.co/IOfaP2W920 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) July 17, 2020

“These criminals have waged war against their country, murdered thousands of citizens, destroyed infrastructure and rendered entire families permanently displaced and dislocated,” he continued. “Why should rehabilitating the perpetrator be more important than bringing succour to the victims?”

Mallam Garba Shehu, Buhari’s senior special assistant in charge of media and publicity, in turn accused the cleric of engaging in partisan politics.

“In saying that Boko Haram terrorism is worse than it was in 2015, he did not speak like a man of God,” Shehu said in a statement Monday. “Kukah should go to Borno or Adamawa to ask the citizens there about the difference between 2014 and 2021.”

“He is playing in partisan politics by dragging the president into it,” Shehu said. “If you claim to be a man of God, as Bishop Mathew Hassan Kukah does, ideology should not stand in the way of facts and fairness.”

“Some of the comments are no more than a sample of the unrestrained rhetoric Fr. Kukah trades in, which he often does in the guise of a homily,” the president’s spokesman said.

“We urge well-meaning citizens to continue supporting the administration’s ongoing efforts to secure the country and move it forward,” he added.

Bishop Kukah is not alone in his criticism of government inaction against Islamic terror in Nigeria under President Buhari.

In September 2019, Catholic leaders in Nigeria denounced the state of unrest and violence in the country, urging Buhari to step up to his responsibility of protecting Nigerian citizens.

“Nigerians are tired of losing their dear ones to these killings,” said the national president of the Catholic Laity Council of Nigeria (CLCN), Thomas Adekoya. “Catholics are tired of mourning and burying their priests who are daily murdered for no just cause.”

Mr. Adekoya was referring to scores of killings of Christians at the hands of different Muslim groups, including murders of Catholic priests.

The Catholic Church is at “the receiving end of some of the most bizarre of these killings,” Adekoya said.

""Christians slaughtered in Nigeria — a Commonwealth country!"" https://t.co/5Ijf6vpoVq — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 18, 2019

“If we hold dear that the protection of lives and property and the welfare of citizens are the greatest responsibility of any government towards its citizens, then our present-day government has fallen far short of the expectation of Nigerians,” he said.

For his part, the Catholic Archbishop of Kaduna Archdiocese, Mathew Man’oso Ndagoso, said that the Buhari government must “wake up to its responsibilities” of ensuring adequate security across the country.

“Anybody who cares for this country must be concerned about what is happening today regarding insecurity,” the archbishop said. “What is happening in the North East which has crept into the North West, South East and South West is becoming alarming.”

“I have made this call before and I will still make it that the responsibility of any government either through the ballot or barrels of the gun or through whatever means is to safeguard the life and property of the citizenry,” he said.

Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari (pictured), who is of the Fulani ethnic group, has been criticized for encouraging a narrative that minimizes the importance of religion in the conflict between Muslims and Christians in central Nigeria.

Two Catholic bishops, as well as other Christian leaders, have insisted that the violence represents a “clear agenda for Islamizing the Nigerian Middle Belt” by using armed Fulani jihadists.

One of the bishops, Matthew Ishaya Audu of Lafia, said in 2018 that the ongoing attacks are not random or economically motivated, but purposefully target Christians.

“They want to strike Christians,” Bishop Audu said, “and the government does nothing to stop them, because President Buhari is also of the Fulani ethnic group.”

In February, 2021, the Nigerian Bishops Conference released a message condemning the ongoing situation of insecurity in the country, again indicting Buhari.

“We are really on the brink of a looming collapse, from which we must do all we can to pull back before the worst overcomes the nation,” the bishops declared.

“The very survival of the nation is at stake,” they said. “The nation is falling apart.”

“Serious insecurity, clearly evident in widespread loss of lives and property, for long unaddressed, has left the sad and dangerous impression that those who have assumed the duty and authority to secure the nation are either unable – or worse still, unwilling – to take up the responsibilities of their office,” the bishops added.

412,Egypt Stages Glittering Parade to Transfer 22 Mummies to New Museum,"Egypt staged an elaborate procession on Saturday to celebrate the transport of 22 of its ancient royal mummies from a historic museum in central Cairo to a newly built facility in the national capital.

The Pharaohs’ Golden Parade moved from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo’s main Tahrir Square to the newly constructed National Museum of Egyptian Civilization located four miles south. Golden trucks decorated in pharaonic designs transported the mummies to their new resting place via climate-controlled cases.

“The vehicles were designed to appear like the ancient boats used to carry deceased pharaohs to their tombs,” according to the Associated Press (AP).

The mummies of 22 ancient Egyptian rulers were paraded through the streets of Cairo on April 3. The pharaohs were given a ‘golden parade’ as they moved from their previous home at the Egyptian Museum to a new national museum a few miles away ⚱️ pic.twitter.com/VPmwDtZOGP — NowThis (@nowthisnews) April 5, 2021

Most of the mummies date to ancient Egypt’s New Kingdom, which ruled from 1539 B.C. to 1075 B.C., according to Egypt’s Ministry of Antiquities. The parade transported 18 kings and four queens in chronological order of their rule. The procession included some of ancient Egypt’s most famous leaders, such as Ramses II, who ruled for 67 years, and Queen Hatshepsut, Egypt’s only female pharaoh.

Cairo authorities shut down several streets and intersections in the capital to accommodate the event, which included a gala in Tahrir Square where representatives of 400 international press agencies gathered in bleachers to document the spectacle. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi joined other Egyptian dignitaries in Tahrir Square to watch the parade before welcoming the mummies as they arrived at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. The president’s welcoming ceremony served as an inauguration of the new museum, which has only displayed partial exhibits since it was built in 2017. Twenty of the mummies will go on display to the general public starting April 18, while two others will be stored.

“This majestic scene is a new evidence of the greatness of this people, the guarding of this unique civilization that extends into the depths of history,” Al-Sisi wrote in a Twitter statement.

The Egyptian government spent millions of dollars organizing the Pharaohs’ Golden Parade as a way to encourage international tourism to Egypt. The country relies heavily upon the tourism industry for revenue and has suffered great economic losses in the sector due to the ongoing Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, a 2011 popular uprising caused years of political turmoil for Egypt and discouraged tourists from visiting the country.

The movement of the mummies from their decades-long resting place at Cairo’s old museum has caused some observers to speculate that the disturbance may have unleashed a so-called “curse of the pharaohs” on Egypt, which has suffered a string of bad luck in the weeks since the Pharaohs’ Golden Parade was announced.

Dozens of people died when two passenger trains collided in Sohag, Upper Egypt, on March 26, and at least 18 people died when an apartment building collapsed in Cairo the next day.

“Then, as preparations were in full swing to move the mummies to their new resting place, the Suez Canal was blocked by the giant container ship the Ever Given, for almost a week,” the AP noted on Sunday. Egypt suffered an estimated $1 billion loss from the nearly weeklong blockage, which took place from March 23-29.

The “curse of the pharaohs” dates to the 1922 discovery of King Tutankhamun’s tomb, when a warning inscription reading “Death will come on quick wings for those who disturb the king’s peace” was also allegedly unearthed alongside the teenage ruler’s sarcophagus. The myth of the pharaohs’ curse has survived over the past century, despite a lack of evidence that this warning inscription exists.",1
413,Islamic State Mozambique Invasion Sent Thousands Fleeing Country,"More than 50,000 people have been affected by recent Islamic terror attacks in northeastern Mozambique and need food assistance, the World Food Program (WFP) said Thursday.

Hundreds of terrorists believed to be linked to the Islamic State (ISIS) attacked the Mozambican natural gas hub of Palma, located in Cabo Delgado province, on March 24. The jihadis laid siege to the city for several days and killed dozens of Palma residents, including foreigners contracted to work at a nearby liquefied gas plant. ISIS formally claimed responsibility for the attack on Palma on March 29 and remained in control of the resort town as of the same day according to Dyck Advisory Group, a South African private security firm hired by the Mozambican government to defend Palma.

The attack sparked a grand exodus from Palma to neighboring towns and provinces.

“Hundreds of people fled the fighting, running into forests, mangroves, or nearby villages,” the BBC reported March 28.

“It’s a real humanitarian catastrophe,” WFP Director for Southern Africa Lola Castro said in a press statement issued April 1. “People are heading all over the place — by boat, on foot, by road.”

The WFP is distributing emergency food packages to “support the people wherever they are,” and collaborating with U.N.I.C.E.F. to supply a “desperate population” with drinking water, Castro said.

U.N.I.C.E.F. stands for the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. The WFP is the food-assistance branch of the U.N.

“The situation is very bad and it’s affecting Cabo Delgado’s neighboring provinces,” Castro said Thursday, adding, “We don’t have enough resources to support the scale-up that is needed.”

One week since the attack on Palma, #Mozambique, began, the security situation reportedly remains volatile and thousands of people are on the move in search of safety & assistance.

Nearly 9,200 have already arrived in other districts of #CaboDelgado: https://t.co/bCfsRwb3JL pic.twitter.com/JXKTeEt9wL — OCHA Southern & Eastern Africa (@UNOCHA_ROSEA) April 2, 2021

The March 24 attack on Palma “uprooted many who had been sheltering there after having fled conflict in other parts of Cabo Delgado,” according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (O.C.H.A.).

More than 9,100 people have arrived in the Cabo Delgado towns of Nangade, Mueda, and Montepuez since March 24 and some displaced persons have even been driven to the nearby Tanzanian island of Pemba, the O.C.H.A. said in a flash update April 2.

“Roughly two-thirds of people arriving in neighboring towns are staying with host families, “who have generously opened their homes to those fleeing the violence,” according to the update.

“Thousands more are reportedly on the move through the forest in search of safety and are expected to arrive at different locations in the days ahead,” the office added.",1
414,Report Decries ‘Sustained Campaign’ of Anti-Christian Violence in Nigeria,"A spokesman for Christian Solidarity Worldwide (CSW) warned Friday of a “sustained campaign” of anti-Christian violence in Nigeria, which has increased in severity in recent years.

Recent attacks on Christians “are the latest in a sustained campaign of violence which has been ongoing in multiple states in central Nigeria for over a decade now,” Ellis Heasley, Public Affairs officer at CSW, said in an interview with Crux, an online Catholic news outlet.

“Christians in particular are extremely vulnerable to attacks by an armed group comprising members of the Fulani ethnic group, often referred to as the Fulani militia, to distinguish them from peaceable Fulani communities,” Heasley said.

“Last year saw a significant and sustained uptick in violence of this kind across Nigeria,” Heasley said. “CSW received reports of such attacks, particularly in Kaduna state, on an almost daily basis.”

“Hundreds of civilians have been killed and abducted for ransom, and thousands have been displaced, with some members of the international community raising concerns that the current violence bears the hallmarks of atrocity crimes,” he added. “This year attacks are also being reported increasingly from southern Nigeria.”

In December 2019, the Wall Street Journal published a report stating that Islamist Fulani militants are waging a brutal war on Nigeria’s Christians in a campaign to rid the country’s Middle Belt of non-Muslims.

Fulani radicals now pose a greater threat than the Islamic terror group Boko Haram, French intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy wrote, and they carry out systematic attacks against Christians, which include burning, raping, maiming, pillaging, and killing.

This “slow-motion war” against Nigeria’s Christians is “massive in scale and horrific in brutality,” Lévy said, and yet “the world has hardly noticed.”

Lévy also accused mainstream media of disingenuously describing the attacks on Christians as ethnically or economically motivated, a false narrative promulgated by “professional disinformers.”

“They are Islamic extremists of a new stripe,” a Nigerian NGO director whom Lévy interviewed stated, “more or less linked with Boko Haram.”

International Christian Concern (ICC) has estimated that between 50,000 and 70,000 Christians have been killed by radical Islamists in Nigeria — primarily Fulani militants and members of the Boko Haram terror group — over the past decade.

When Fulani militants “attack these farming villages, they often burn down churches, kill pastors, and destroy Christians’ homes and shops,” noted Nathan Johnson, ICC’s regional manager for Africa. “I have never heard of a mosque being destroyed or imam being killed during these attacks, so there is a clear sign that they at least hate Christianity, if they are not blatantly targeting Christians.”

In his interview this week, Heasley said this violence “is showing no sign of slowing in 2021,” adding that there is a need for “urgent international intervention” to help the government address the threats posed by the Fulani militants and both factions of the Boko Haram terrorist group.

“These attacks paint a worrying picture for freedom of religion or belief (FoRB) in Nigeria, in which members of religious minority communities in the center of the country continue to be targeted within a climate of impunity,” Heasley said.

Nigeria’s population of approximately 206 million is nearly evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. Islam is the dominant faith in the North and Christianity in the South – but most killings take place in Nigeria’s Middle Belt, where the two halves of the country meet.

415,Islamic State Celebrates Mozambique Gas Hub Massacre,"The Islamic State (ISIS) claimed responsibility for last week’s attack on the Mozambican town of Palma, a local news site reported on Tuesday.

Hundreds of terrorists believed to be tied to ISIS stormed Palma on March 24. The resort town lies north of a natural gas processing plant that employs large numbers of foreign workers throughout the area. The jihadis laid siege to Palma, infiltrating military barracks, banks, shops, and homes.

The Islamic State formally claimed responsibility for Palma’s seizure through its online propaganda outlet, the Amaq News Agency, on March 29, saying the attack had “resulted in the deaths of 55 Mozambican forces and Christians including contractors from outside the country.”

A Mozambican affiliate of ISIS known locally as Shabaab, or “the youth” in Arabic, carried out the assault on Palma, according to the Associated Press. Shabaab is the colloquial term for the militant group, which has no known links to the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate “Al-Shabaab.” Mozambique’s Shabaab group was admitted to the Islamic State’s Central Africa Province (ISCAP) in 2019 and formally named “Ahl al-Sunnah wa al Jamma’ah (ASWJ).”

A top al-Qaeda leader issued statements this week seeming to challenge the Islamic State’s claim of responsibility for the attack on Palma, noting that the photo used by Amaq News Agency to demonstrate ISIS’s presence in Palma was in fact an old photo taken when ASWJ seized Mocímboa da Praia, a key port town located 50 miles south of Palma, in August 2020.

“Using a photo that was taken in an entirely different place is a sign that the terrorists were unable to send their media any usable photos of Palma,” the Mozambican Information Agency noted on Tuesday, pointing to a practical reason for the discrepancy. The town of Palma and its surrounding area is believed to be under a communications blackout, with either limited or no telephone and internet access.

Palma’s communications blackout has made it difficult for journalists and government authorities to confirm details of the siege, including the number of people killed by ISIS over the past week. Many area residents remain unaccounted for. ISIS killed at least dozens of people in Palma from March 24-29 as its members attempted to take control of the town. The Islamic State remained in control of Palma as of March 29, according to Dyck Advisory Group, a South African private security firm hired by the Mozambican government to protect the town.

“My guys are engaging these terrorists in skirmishes. The terrorists have taken cover in houses, which is what they always do. They come out and shoot at the aircraft, and they have hit and shot at our aircraft often,” the firm’s CEO, Lionel Dyck, told the BBC on Monday. “Until we put sufficient troops in there to clear them out of the houses of Palma they will remain in control.”

Some survivors of the Palma siege “walked for 100 kilometers [60 miles] to the town of Nangade, where … they said the raiders had singled out state employees for attack,” the Mozambican Information Agency reported on Tuesday, citing the local news site Mediafax. “Speaking in Swahili, the terrorists said they wanted to seize public officials because they believed they could use them as bargaining chips to oblige the [Mozambican] government to implement sharia [Islamic] law. … [T]hey believed that these officials were the obstacle to implementing Islamic religious norms in Cabo Delgado,” the province in which Palma is located.",1
416,Antony Blinken: Reproductive Rights Are ‘Human Rights’,"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reinstated abortion and reproductive rights in the list of “human rights” to be evaluated in the State Department’s annual global human rights report.

“Women’s rights, including sexual and reproductive rights, are human rights,” Blinken told reporters Tuesday.

The Biden administration is resuming the practice of including abortion policy as part of the State Department’s annual survey of global human rights in different countries, reversing a decision by the Trump administration.

In releasing its annual global human-rights report Tuesday, the State Department said an addendum will be added later this year to cover previously dropped topics, including maternal mortality, access to contraception and reproductive healthcare, topics that had been dropped during the Trump presidency.

As part of the official U.S. human rights program, the State Department will resume the practice of the Obama administration of pressing countries to legalize abortion.

During his first days in office, President Biden began reversing the Trump administration’s elimination of taxpayer-funded abortions, repealing the Mexico City policy, which prevents federal funds from going to groups that perform overseas abortions.

African human rights activists reacted strongly to the measure, warning of a neo-colonialist push by the Biden administration to force Africans to abandon their values, which include appreciation for every human life including those not yet born.

A group called Culture of Life Africa released a video titled “A Message for President Biden,” which begins: “We appeal to Joe Biden, please do not, do not, do not, sponsor abortion in Africa.”

“We all deserve the right to live. I stand against the funding of abortion in Africa,” declares another speaker.

Nigerian human rights activist Obianuju Ekeocha, a biomedical scientist, also decried President Biden’s overturning of the Mexico City policy, especially as it affects Africa.

“The experts in the halls of Western power disregard the views and the values of an entire nation in order to push their pro-abortion agenda,” Ekeocha states in her 2018 book Target Africa: Ideological Neocolonialism in the Twenty-First Century.

“At the core of my people’s value system is the profound recognition that human life is precious, paramount, and supreme,” she states. “For us, abortion, which is the deliberate killing of little ones in the womb, is a direct attack on innocent human life. It is a serious injustice, which no one should have the right to commit.”

Unfortunately, Ekeocha observes, in their efforts to impose an abortion culture, those in the West care little for what Africans want.

“It is time for the international community to listen to the voices of the African people and to desist from pushing abortion on them,” she declares.

The financing of abortion in Africa, Ekeocha notes, is part of a larger war on the African people. “Western nations, organizations, and foundations wage war against the bodies of African women” in a frontal attack on “female fertility,” she says.

“The insistence on reducing the population of Africa, no matter what the cost to the Africans themselves, is racism, imperialism, and colonialism disguised as philanthropy,” she states.

The head of the West African Bishops’ Conference has also denounced Biden’s decision “to promote the destruction of human lives domestically and in developing nations” through taxpayer-funded abortion.

In a February 3 interview with Crux, a U.S.-based online Catholic news outlet, Archbishop Ignatius Kaigama of Abuja said that Biden’s revival of U.S. taxpayer funding for abortions overseas “does not stand to reason” but rather “violates human dignity.”

“As I understand it, President Biden’s memorandum reverses restrictions on abortion access domestically and abroad imposed and expanded by the Trump administration,” the archbishop said. “It is intriguing that one of Biden’s first official acts is to promote the destruction of human lives domestically and in developing nations.”

In his interview, Archbishop Kaigama did not only appeal to Biden’s duty as a Catholic, but rather to his duty as president, charged with protecting the lives of citizens and promoting the common good.

“The President should use his office to prioritize the most vulnerable, including unborn children,” the archbishop said. “Vatican II and all the Popes down to Pope Francis have described the deliberate killing of a child before or after birth as a most grievous violation of God’s commandments.”

“Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes,” Kaigama said, citing the Second Vatican Council. “As Bishops, we have always reiterated that abortion is a direct attack on life that also wounds the woman and undermines the family and above all, it offends God.”

417,Tanzania: 45 Died in a Stampede During President's Memorial Service,"At least 45 people were killed in a stampede that broke out last week in Dar es Salaam during a public viewing of Tanzania’s late president, John Magufuli, local police confirmed on Monday.

The stampede took place on March 21 at Dar es Salaam’s Uhuru Stadium, where Tanzanian government officials staged a public viewing for late President Magufuli following his death from a “heart illness” on March 17.

“[A] stampede occurred when some Dar es Salaam residents attempted to enter the stadium via unofficial entrance points as the crowd got larger,” the Citizen, a Tanzanian newspaper, reported on March 30.

“They went to the stadium in order to express their love for their departed leader but because the number of people was huge, some became impatient and opted to using unofficial entry points and that was how the problem occurred,” Dar es Salaam Police Commander Lazaro Mambosasa told the Citizen‘s sister paper, the Mwananchi, on March 29.

At least 37 more people were wounded in the stampede, according to Mambosasa, who added that all of those injured “were progressing well and had been discharged from various hospitals” as of Monday.

While the police chief could not name the stampede’s victims, the Citizen revealed the identities of several people killed during the event on Tuesday. Five members of a single Dar es Salaam family died during the stadium tragedy, according to the newspaper.

“On Thursday, March 25, hundreds of mourners turned up at the home of Mr. David Mtuwa in Dar es Salaam to pay their last respects to five family members who lost their lives during the stampede at Uhuru Stadium on Sunday, March 21,” according to the Citizen. “Christian (11), Michelle (8), Nathan (6), Natalia (5), Suzan Ndana Mtuwa (30s) and a housemaid Anita Mfik- wa (27) died as they went to pay their last respects to the body of former President John Magufuli.”

The BBC first reported on the family’s deaths on March 22, identifying the victims as “Dennis Mtuwa’s wife, two of his children, a nephew, and a niece.”

“These last 24 hours have been really difficult for me. I feel relieved when I’m surrounded by people, but when I’m alone the amount of grief becomes overwhelming,” Mr. Mtuwa told the BBC at the time.

The Citizen on March 30 identified an additional stampede victim as Rose John. The woman’s body was recently transported from Dar es Salaam to northwestern Tanzania’s Kagera region for burial, according to the newspaper.

Tens of thousands of people packed into Uhuru Stadium on March 20 and 21 for a chance to pay their respects to late President Magufuli, who died from a “heart illness” according to the Tanzanian authorities. Prior to the government’s announcement of Magufuli’s death, the leader had been uncharacteristically absent from public for nearly three weeks. Tanzanian government officials initially refused to comment on Magufuli’s disappearance, sparking speculation that the leader had fallen ill or contracted the Chinese coronavirus.",1
418,Human Rights Watch Condemns African Leaders Backing Chinese Genocide,"The non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch published a plea to leaders of African countries Monday to stop supporting China’s attempts to avoid accountability for the ongoing genocide of Uyghur and other Turkic Muslims populations in Xinjiang.

The Chinese Communist Party faces a litany of accusations — based on extensive research, eyewitness testimonies, surveillance footage, and other hard evidence — of crimes that amount to genocide against minority ethnic populations in Xinjiang, its westernmost and largest province. Among the most horrific realities is the construction of hundreds of concentration camps believed to house as many as 3 million people at their peak. Survivors of the camps have testified to indoctrination, beatings, forced sterilization, “nightly” gang rape, and medical practices consistent with live organ harvesting. A study by international experts published this month concluded China is guilty of every element in the international legal definition of genocide.

Outside of the camps, extensive evidence suggests China has enslaved hundreds of thousands of Xinjiang residents in its cotton trade, destroyed heritage sites and cemeteries, and implemented a pervasive, high-tech surveillance system that tracks the activities of every non-Han person in the region.

Human Rights Watch Africa Advocacy Director Carine Kanez Nantulya noted in a statement published Monday that the governments of Burkina Faso, the Republic of Congo, and Sudan recently allowed their ambassadors to China to partake in a propaganda event in which the Communist Party claimed to have brought peace and stability to Xinjiang through its repression of the local Uyghur population, condemning human rights activists who have spoken out against abuses there.

“They extolled Chinese authorities’ success in raising the standard of living in the region and dismissed Western criticism of China as driven by ulterior motives,” Nantulya wrote. “There is little evidence that the ambassadors discussed Beijing’s strategy of mass arbitrary detentions, which have seen around one million Turkic Muslims detained simply based on their identity.”

“The event might be routine diplomacy, but African governments’ willingness to remain silent on Beijing’s suppression of rights has real-world consequences,” the expert continued. “Some have helped defend China’s Xinjiang policies at the United Nations Human Rights Council, where Burkina Faso and Sudan are members, while introducing a resolution to bring systemic racism in the US and around the world under international scrutiny.”

Nantulya urged African politicians to “try seeing Xinjiang through the eyes of the Turkic Muslim population that has endured torture, enforced disappearances and cultural persecution,” accusing them of allowing “economic benefits gained from China” to cloud their public morals.

Nantulya notably concluded without referring to the campaign to eliminate the Uyghurs and other Turkic people of Xinjiang as a “genocide.” While campaigning for the human rights of Uyghurs for years, Human Rights Watch has avoided the term despite several governments, including that of the United States, ruling the coordinated persecution a “genocide.”

Human Rights Watch most recently expressed frustration at African nations for their relationship with China during the wave of racist events against black people in Guangzhou, southern China, last year. Guangzhou is home to one of China’s largest African ex-pat communities, which became the target of extreme racism at the height of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic in April last year.

“We have pictures showing how some people were locked down in their apartments without food. You can’t go out on the street if you are black,” a spokeswoman for an association of Nigerians living in China told Voice of America at the time. Videos of Africans sleeping in the streets became prominent on social media after landlords evicted them and hotels refused to house them, despite the fact that they were paying their rents and could afford apartments and hotel rooms. Local restaurants, including McDonald’s, placed signs on their windows stating they would not serve black-skinned people.

The Chinese government responded to the international outcry over the situation in Guangzhou by stating that the accusations were “absurd” and Africans needed to “readjust their way of thinking.”

“Some African governments have expressed disillusion with the Chinese regime, but many have deep financial ties to Beijing, compromising their stances,” Human Rights Watch observed at the time, noting that many African countries have become deeply indebted through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a Chinese global infrastructure takeover project.

“China has invested billions into a plan known as the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI), which it debuted as a plan to reconstruct the ancient Silk Road from western Europe to Beijing,” Human Rights Watch noted. “Instead, it has invested in building expensive infrastructure projects in Africa, paid for through predatory loans offered to the local governments.”

“African governments together should unequivocally call on the Chinese government to cease all discrimination against Africans in China, and carry out prompt and transparent investigations to hold to account all those responsible for discriminatory practices,” Nantulya suggested then.

A year later, little evidence exists that the Chinese Communist Party suffered any consequences as a result of the racist policies implemented in Guangzhou.

419,Mozambique: Islamic State Massacres Dozens in Natural Gas Hub Siege,"Islamic State jihadists in Mozambique killed dozens of civilians over the weekend during a violent seizure of Palma, a natural gas hub located on the country’s northeast coast that employs scores of foreign workers.

Hundreds of terrorists believed to be tied to the Islamic State (ISIS) stormed Palma on March 24, infiltrating military barracks, shops, and banks to begin a siege of the resort town. An ISIS propaganda outlet alleged on March 29 that 55 people, including Mozambican soldiers and foreign nationals, had been killed in the assault on Palma since last week, though this figure has not been independently verified. The Islamic State formally claimed responsibility for the attack on Palma through the same propaganda outlet on Monday, publishing a photo to the website allegedly showing a group of militants from its Mozambican branch in the town.

The militants attacked a convoy filled with unarmed civilians as it attempted to flee Palma’s besieged Amarula Hotel on March 26. “The defense and security forces registered the loss of seven lives of a group of citizens that left the Amarula hotel in a convoy that was ambushed by the terrorists,” Omar Saranga, a spokesperson for Mozambique’s defense department, told reporters on March 28, though witnesses say many more people are still unaccounted for.

“Hundreds of people fled the fighting, running into forests, mangroves or nearby villages,” the BBC reported on Sunday. “Some tried to escape the hotel in a convoy of vehicles on Friday, aiming for a nearby beach. At least 20 people were reportedly flown to safety in helicopters, but others were ambushed outside the hotel.”

“Witnesses have described hiding out while waiting to be rescued by boat, on a beach strewn with headless bodies,” according to the British broadcaster.

South African national Adrien Nel, 40, was among those killed as he attempted to escape from Amarula Hotel on Friday. Nel’s mother, Meryl Knox, told the BBC on Monday that he was riding in the fleeing convoy along with his father and brother as it was stopped by terrorists. The jihadis shot and killed Nel, but his father and brother survived the attack and recovered Nel’s body as they fled the ambush. Nel’s father, Gregory Knox, and brother, Wesley, “hid with his body in the bush until the following morning [March 27], when they were able to make it to safety in Pemba [155 miles south of Palma],” Mrs. Knox said told Reuters.

“No army to protect them, none of them having weapons, so it was a matter of run for your life or face these insurgents, who are so cruel and barbaric,” she told the BBC.

Dyck Advisory Group — a South African private security firm hired by the Mozambican government to defend Palma — told the BBC that the jihadists were “still in control of Palma” as of March 29.

“My guys are engaging these terrorists in skirmishes. The terrorists have taken cover in houses, which is what they always do. They come out and shoot at the aircraft, and they have hit and shot at our aircraft often,” the firm’s CEO, Lionel Dyck, told the broadcaster on Monday.

“Until we put sufficient troops in there to clear them out of the houses of Palma they will remain in control,” he added.

Dyck Advisory Group’s account of the current situation in Palma conflicted with Mozambique government statements on the town’s status on Monday. Mozambique’s state news agency quoted unnamed government sources on March 29 alleging Islamic State terrorists had been “driven out” of Palma and were “fleeing” towards the Tanzania border.",1

421,African Pilots and Belaursian Mercenary Tried for Bombing French Soldiers,"(AFP) — Three men went on trial in Paris on Monday over the bombing of a French military camp in Ivory Coast in 2004, which killed nine soldiers and sparked furious reprisals by the French, causing a deep rift in Franco-Ivorian relations.

But none of the suspects were present in court and their whereabouts are unknown.

Two Ivorian fighter jets were involved in the November 6, 2004 attack on French peacekeeping forces in Bouake, which was at the time in rebel-held territory.

Flying low, one of the planes fired rockets into the camp, killing nine soldiers and an American aid worker. Forty others were injured.

The attack came during an aerial offensive by then Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo to try reclaim the country’s north, which had been in rebel hands since 2002.

France reacted furiously, wiping out Ivory Coast’s entire fleet of military aircraft, dealing a severe blow to Gbagbo’s bid to end the rebellion.

Relations between France and its former colony, which had already been fraught, quickly deteriorated.

Violent anti-France protests broke out across the nationalist south.

France, fearing for the safety of its nationals in Ivory Coast, airlifted thousands of expatriates to safety.

‘We want the truth’

On Monday, one of two Belarussian mercenaries accused of carrying out the raid on the Bouake camp, Yury Sushkin, went on trial for murder, along with two Ivorian co-pilots, Ange Magloire Gnanduillet Attualy and Patrice Ouei.

All three were among crew members caught on camera after landing at an airport near the capital Yamoussoukro following the bombing raid.

If convicted they face a maximum term of life imprisonment, but as their whereabouts are unknown it is unlikely they will serve jail time in France.

Relatives of the victims are mainly hoping that the trial will provide clues about who ordered the attack on French forces and why.

Officials close to Gbagbo, who was toppled by French-backed rebel forces in 2011, claimed that the pilot mistook the French camp for rebel positions.

But some suspect it was a deliberate hit, aimed at clearing a path for Gbagbo’s forces to storm rebel-held territory, or even that France itself masterminded the attack on its forces to have a pretext to try chase Gbagbo from power.

Among the many questions hanging over the affair is why France rejected an offer to have Sushkin handed over when he was arrested in Togo, which borders Ivory Coast, a few days after the airstrike.

“We want to learn the truth,” the children of one of the victims of the attack, Philippe Capdeville, told AFP, adding: “The silence of French authorities on this affair is dramatic.”

422,Suez Canal (Almost) Clear as Stranded Ship ‘Partially Refloated’,"The massive container ship MV Ever Given which has been blocking the Suez Canal for almost a week was “partially refloated” Monday morning, raising hopes the critical waterway will soon be cleared for a resumption of maritime traffic.

Suez Canal Authority (SCA) chief Osama Rabie said rescue efforts with tugs had succeeded in shifting the bow and stern of the ship to align with the direction of the waterway however it is not yet underway.

“The position of the ship has been reorientated 80 percent in the right direction,” Rabie in a statement. “The stern… moved to 102 metres (335 feet) from the shore,” compared to its position four metres from the shore previously.

Efforts to fully refloat it will resume on the next high tide completing an effort that began when the ship first became stranded last Tuesday, as Breitbart News reported.

The SCA statement confirmed the refloating process “will resume when water flow increases again from 11:30 local time… in order to completely refloat the vessel, so as to reposition it in the middle of the waterway.”

An official from the 200,000-tonne ship’s owners, Shoei Kisen, said while the Ever Given “has turned”, it “is not afloat.”

The ship had been “stuck at an angle of 30 degrees towards the canal, but that has eased,” said the official.

“A total of 11 tug boats have been pulling Ever Given since this morning,” they added, saying that while there was damage sustained by the ship on its bow when it got stuck, “but no new damage has been reported.”

It is not yet clear when traffic along the canal will resume.

A canal official, who requested anonymity, said shipping officials had started technical checks, and were reassured the ship’s engine was working.

Each day of the blockade could be costing global trade some $6-10 billion, according to a study published Friday by German insurer Allianz.

That translates to some 0.2 to 0.4 percentage points of annual trade each week.

Authorities said 369 ships are currently stalled as they wait for the canal to reopen.

423,Kenya: Hospitals Charging for Vaccines They Don't Have,"Two Kenyan health ministry agencies denied authorizing the use of the Russian-made coronavirus vaccine candidate Sputnik V in Kenya this week despite reports that some Kenyan hospitals are already charging citizens to register for the shot.

Collins Tabu, the head of immunization at Kenya’s health ministry, said on March 24 he was “not aware of the Sputnik V vaccine’s existence in the country, even as the [Kenyan] Pharmacy and Poisons Board (PPB) said it had only approved its importation but not distribution,” Kenya’s Daily Nation newspaper reported on March 25.

“Private health facilities such as the Nanyuki Cottage Hospital had by on Wednesday [March 24] already started registering Kenyans for uptake of the jab at a reported cost of Sh8,000 [$73],” according to the newspaper.

Kenya’s Senate Health Committee also denied knowledge of Sputnik V’s authorization for use in the country on Wednesday.

“While inspecting the National Vaccine Depot in Kitengela yesterday, Committee chairperson Sabina Chege, said parliament is only aware of the [approval of the] AstraZeneca vaccine,” the Daily Nation reported, referring to the Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate developed by the German-Swedish pharmaceutical company Astra-Zeneca.

An official for Kenya’s PPB who asked not to be named told the Daily Nation on Thursday that the health agency had “authorized the importation of Sputnik V, but claimed the board was not aware of its distribution across the country.”

Nishant Mishra, a senior official at Sputnik V’s Kenyan distributor, Dinlas Pharmaceuticals, told the newspaper that the vaccine candidate “has been imported with the full knowledge and clearance of the PPB.”

Moscow’s Gamaleya Institute developed Sputnik V last year. It was registered by Russian health officials in August 2020 as the first vaccine candidate to be approved for use against the Chinese coronavirus anywhere in the world. The Russian Ministry of Health allegedly broke its own protocol to rush Sputnik V through approvals so that it could be used for emergency use in the country. The ministry registered the vaccine candidate before it had cleared Phase III clinical trials and without releasing clinical data on its safety or efficacy rate. The Lancet medical journal published late-stage clinical data for Sputnik V in February showing the shot allegedly had an efficacy rate of 92 percent against the Chinese coronavirus.

Russia has offered Sputnik V to dozens of countries, including Kenya, for use in their domestic coronavirus vaccination drives. At least 49 countries have approved the shot for emergency use so far. Hungary became the first European Union (E.U.) country to grant Sputnik V initial use approval on January 22 despite continued resistance by the European Medicines Agency, the E.U.’s health authority, to approve the vaccine candidate for emergency use bloc-wide.",1
424,Suez Canal Blockage Holding Up $9.6 Billion in Goods per Day,"The blockage of the Suez Canal by stranded container supership MV Ever Given is turning out to be more of a catastrophe than originally anticipated.

Taiwan-based Evergreen Group, the ship’s operator, said Friday it will take at least another two or three days to get the ship moving again, and it could take weeks for Suez traffic to return to normal.

Maritime traffic is beginning to route around the blocked canal, adding weeks to shipping time and millions in additional costs. An estimated $9.6 billion in shipped goods is being held up by the calamity every day.

Early bouts of optimism that tugboats could dislodge the ship, or at least move it out of the way, gave way Thursday to viral images of bulldozers vainly attempting to dig sand away from the hull of the ship or nudge it back into the water. Observers around the world are trying to find a dash of humor in the bizarre images:

Evergreen representatives said the effort to dig sand away from the bow of the ship and refloat it at high tide would require up to three more days. A refloating attempt on Friday was unsuccessful.

Suez Canal officials originally hoped the ship could be moved within a matter of hours and the canal could reopen by the weekend. An adviser to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi predicted Thursday that navigation through the canal “will resume again within 48-72 hours, maximum,” a far more optimistic estimate than most other analysts are offering.

“It’s a difficult process. The ship’s bow is still wedged in the canal wall, and there could be some structural damage. If you try to yank it out, things could get worse and fuel could spill out. It’s the worst place in the canal for such a big ship to be stuck,” a source involved in the operation told the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

According to the WSJ, after waiting a few days to see how the rescue operation was going, the owners of some 300 idled ships have begun rerouting them around the canal toward the Cape of Good Hope, or making other adjustments to the course of ships approaching through the Mediterranean. Some operators are apparently choosing to sit tight and wait for the Suez to clear, since the alternate route can add weeks to a ship’s journey.

A logistics expert told the BBC on Friday it would take about two days to undo every day of delay from the closed canal.

“If the delays are short, most companies will absorb the extra delay in transit times. But salvage officials said the congestion could last days or even weeks, in a blow to global supply chains already strained by the Covid-19 [coronavirus] pandemic,” the BBC reported.

The Suez situation is fast becoming a global shipping and oil crisis, and the WSJ explained it will affect American companies and consumers:

While European and Asian businesses are likely to feel the brunt of the disruption, U.S. importers could also be affected. Demand for containers and berthing space soared late last year and into this year, well before the current Suez crisis. Backups in container ports, especially along the West coast of the U.S., have grown during a normally slack period in shipping demand. That has tied up inventories for weeks in some cases, as ships wait to reach berths while unloaded containers sit for long periods at packed freight terminals. The Suez blockage “will drastically reduce global container shipping capacity and lead to further delays for American importers to get their orders delivered,” said Lars Jensen, chief executive of Copenhagen-based SeaIntelligence Consulting. “This couldn’t have come at a worse time because all ships available have already been deployed.”

Rising costs of shipping are expected to ripple through the global economy, affecting even companies that ship by truck and rail. Shipping costs are already up some 30 percent worldwide, with some even higher spikes reported.

Port authorities are bracing for pandemonium when fleets of long-delayed ships finally begin arriving after rounding the Cape of Good Hope or waiting for the Suez Canal to clear. Just as a problem with one airport can cause a chain reaction of disruptions and missed connections across the country, so the Suez blockage is beginning to rattle countless supply lines that were indirectly relying on shipments to arrive through the canal. Many of those secondary supply lines involved shipments of oil and gas. Fortunately, seasonal demand for oil is running relatively low at the moment.

“It’s not going to be an easy operation. It’s probably going to be an expensive one. It’s already very expensive because so many ships have been blocked from going through. More than likely there will be massive lawsuits from other shipping companies and people who expected their goods and parts to arrive on time,” U.S. National Defense University professor Paul Sullivan told Voice of America News (VOA) on Thursday.

Sullivan doubted the Egyptian government and Suez Canal operators would be held responsible for the incident, which has thus far been blamed on high winds. “The real responsibility is going to be on the part of the ship itself, and Egypt will most likely fine that shipping company and the people involved in this incident a very large sum,” he anticipated.

The Egyptians have reportedly requested assistance from the Netherlands, which was MV Ever Given’s destination. The U.S. government offered its assistance Friday, possibly in the form of a U.S. Navy dredging team. Evergreen Marine has already hired Dutch and Japanese firms to consult on refloating the ship.

“We can’t exclude it might take weeks, depending on the situation,” the CEO of Evergreen’s Dutch contractor said Thursday.",1
425,Zimbabwe’s President Receives Chinese Vaccine in Public,"President of Zimbabwe Emmerson Mnangagwa received the Chinese-made coronavirus vaccine candidate “Coronavac” in public on Wednesday to help dispel vaccine “conspiracy theories” that the shot is unsafe.

President Mnangagwa received a dose of Coronavac at a tourist resort in Victoria Falls, located on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, on March 24. The president’s injection was broadcast live on state-run TV. Mnangagwa was joined by a group of Zimbabwean opposition leaders at the event who received doses of Coronavac alongside him. The event was designed to demonstrate the vaccine candidate’s safety to Zimbabweans, who have generally been reluctant to participate in Zimbabwe’s coronavirus vaccine drive since it launched on February 18.

“I therefore challenge all of us in our respective communities to accept the vaccination program and to shun vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and the negative conspiracy theories,” Mnangagwa said before receiving his dose of the product.

“Just over 44,000 people in Zimbabwe have been vaccinated so far, representing 68 percent of the target population for the first phase,” Mnangagwa said later at the event.

A cellphone accessory shop worker in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare, explained to Reuters on Wednesday why he has chosen not to receive a dose of Coronavac, the only Chinese coronavirus vaccine candidate currently available in the country.

“I have heard that some people are falling ill after being vaccinated so my family and I will not do it. If I was meant to die I will just die when the time comes, this is not for me,” Blessward Makoni told the news agency.

Some health workers’ unions in Zimbabwe say the federal government has inadvertently caused people to doubt the vaccine candidate’s safety by failing to provide sufficient information about the shot to the public.

China’s state-run biopharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech developed Coronavac. The shot demonstrated an efficacy rate of just 50.38 percent against the Chinese coronavirus according to late-stage clinical data. At least nine people – almost all age 60 or over – have died in Hong Kong over the past month shortly after receiving doses of Coronavac through the city government’s coronavirus vaccination program.

At least ten people have suffered from temporary facial paralysis after they were administered Coronavac, while several others were admitted to intensive care units for various health incidents shortly after receiving the shot. Coronavac’s use in people age 60 and over is currently banned in China due to safety concerns, but Hong Kong health authorities waived health requirements to allow its use among senior citizens in the city last month.",1
426,"Kenya Orders Shutdown of Refugee Camps Housing over 400,000 People","The Interior Ministry of Kenya announced Wednesday it would shut down two camps populated by over 400,000 refugees, mostly from Somalia and Sudan.

Nairobi gave the U.N. Human Rights Commission (UNHCR) two weeks to create a “road map” for evacuating the refugees.

According to Voice of America News (VOA) on Wednesday, the conversation between the Kenyan Interior Ministry and UNHCR grew quite heated, as the Kenyans threatened to send hundreds of thousands of people from the Dadaab and Kakuma camps to the Somali border unless the U.N. quickly made plans to take them elsewhere:

UNHCR said it would continue the dialogue and had asked Kenya to guarantee protection for the refugees. In a statement, the agency said, “The decision would have an impact on the protection of refugees in Kenya, including in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic.” Fred Matiang’i, the interior minister who issued the ultimatum, said there was “no room for further negotiations,” according to the ministry on Twitter.

Kenya has long seen the camps as a security threat and so do U.N. officials and many of the residents. Kidnappings and bombings have been perpetrated at the overcrowded camps and incoming waves of Somalis have unleashed epidemics of diseases like cholera. Sexual abuse, including rape and female genital mutilation, is rampant in the camps, while armed gangs have targeted both refugees and aid workers. Violence has broken out between local tribes and refugees.

Terrorist organizations like al-Qaeda and Somalia’s al-Shabaab recruit from the displaced populations, including the foot soldiers used for bloody terrorist attacks like the Westgate Mall siege in 2013 and the Garissa University slaughter in 2015.

The Kenyan government tried to close the camps in 2015 and 2016 on national security grounds, claiming Dadaab in particular had “lost its humanitarian nature and become a haven for terrorism and other illegal activities.”

International human rights groups and the United Nations criticized the move initially and the Kenyan high court ultimately halted it in 2017, ruling the shutdown order “specifically targeted Somali refugees” in an act of “group persecution” that was “excessive, arbitrary, and disproportionate.”

It was not immediately clear why the government expected its new shutdown order to fare better at the high court. Perhaps the inclusion of the Kakuma camp, with a current population of about 190,000 refugees largely from South Sudan, will be enough to deflect legal challenges that attack the order as “group persecution” against Somalis, or the government feels the security situation has deteriorated enough that judges will no longer regard the order as arbitrary or disproportionate.

The Dadaab refugee complex, which dates back to 1991, was the largest such facility in the world at its peak and would have been considered one of the largest cities in Kenya if the population was Kenyan.

Reuters noted the shutdown order comes at a moment of severe tension between Kenya and Somalia, which broke off diplomatic relations with its neighbor last December, accusing the Kenyans of meddling in Somali politics.

Kenya and Somalia also brought a maritime border dispute before the International Court of Justice this week, potentially affecting their respective national boundaries in an area believed to be rich in oil and natural gas. The Kenyan interior ministry told Reuters the camp closings are not intended to bring diplomatic pressure against Somalia.

UNHCR urged the Kenyan government to make sure that “suitable and sustainable solutions” can be found for residents of the shuttered camps and complained about the “short timeframe” given for the relief agency to make plans.",1
427,"Suez Canal Blockage Enters Day Two, May Last Weeks","The closure of the Suez Canal, one of the world’s busiest maritime shipping lanes, continues into its second day after a cargo ship ran aground and completely blocked passage between the Red and Mediterranean Seas.

The Suez Canal Authority announced Thursday it was “temporarily suspending navigation” through the canal as maritime traffic backed up on both ends, Agence France-Presse reported.

On Wednesday, the MV Ever Given, one of the largest operating cargo vessels, ran aground and turned to lodge its bow and stern at opposing ends of the canal, resulting in the first total blockage of the route in history. The ship sails under a Panamanian flag, though Japanese firm Shoei Kisan owns it with the Taiwanese Evergreen Marine Corp responsible for its operation.

Evergreen attributed the debacle to unusually high winds and a sandstorm present in the area at the time of the vessel’s entry into the canal. Egyptian officials confirmed the weather patterns but have yet to formally produce an explanation for the vessel’s course deviation. Early reports suggested the vessel was experiencing power failures before the incident. Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, the firm directly managing the Ever Given, explicitly denied this, saying “Initial investigations rule out any mechanical or engine failure as a cause of the grounding.” The company further noted that there were no injuries and all of the ship’s cargo had been saved.

Initially, the Suez Canal Authority was optimistic in its timetable for clearing the blockage, estimating traffic might fully resume within two days. Early efforts at moving the Ever Given may have fueled that sentiment, with tugboats able to move the boat to one side of the canal by late Wednesday morning. Thursday’s statement from the Authority, however, stands in stark contrast to the positive tone it set in the fiasco’s infancy.

As of Thursday morning, the tugboats had resumed their efforts, delayed by nightfall, to dig out and re-float the 220,000-ton cargo ship, the Wall Street Journal reported. On-the-ground experts offered pessimistic estimates on the timetable. Dutch salvage expert Peter Berdowski, whom Evergreen hired to help move the ship, vaguely estimated the operation would last “days to weeks.”

Egypt, under President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, has ramped up efforts to expand the canal to allow for two-way traffic of larger vessels, though even such projects have not widened the passage enough to accommodate the Ever Given’s 1300-ft total length.

As of Wednesday, more than 70 ships were waiting on either side of the canal, prompting concerns that such a large concentration of stationary cargo presented a tempting target for Iran, a known maritime predator.

The backlog of shipping is already generating economic fallout. On Wednesday, crude oil prices rose by nearly 3 percent as Middle Eastern fuel shipments to Europe became imperiled.

The Suez Canal sees over ten percent of worldwide shipping pass through its waters each year. Without the critical passage linking the Red and Mediterranean Seas, maritime trading vessels have no alternative route but to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa and circle the entire continent, a vastly longer route incurring additional expenses and holding little appeal for anyone other than 15th-Century Portuguese spice traders.

Completion of the canal under British rule in 1869 allowed trade to bypass the longer route and made the region a crucial economic center for the Empire. Even after Egyptian independence, British and French entities retained control of the vital waterway after Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal Company in 1956, prompting a military intervention that failed to reclaim control of the waterway.",1
428,Pope Francis Laments Massive Presumed Jihadist Attacks in Niger,"ROME — Pope Francis reached out to the people of Niger Wednesday, offering prayers and encouragement following lethal terror attacks that claimed the lives of at least 137 people.

“I learned with sorrow the news of the recent terrorist attacks in Niger, which caused the deaths of 137 people,” the pope said after his weekly General Audience. “Let us pray for the victims, for their families and for the entire population so that the violence suffered may not cause them to lose trust in the path of democracy, justice and peace.”

Three attacks on villages and settlements in western Niger have left more than 200 dead in six days, with Sunday’s killing of at least 137 civilians the deadliest suspected jihadist massacre ever committed in Niger.

According to one local official, “armed men arrived on motorbikes and shot at everything [that] moved.”

Although no group has yet claimed credit for the massacres, they bear the mark of the Islamic State terror group, the only jihadist group in the area large enough and well enough organized to carry out attacks of this magnitude, local media report.

“In treating civilian populations systematically as targets now, these armed bandits have gone a step further into horror and brutality,” said government spokesman Zakaria Abdourahamane in a statement Monday.

The Islamic State has been strengthening its hold in western Niger over the past two years.

According to Ibrahim Yahaya Ibrahim, senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, taxes levied by the jihadists have been increasing, along with and the theft of cattle, the murder of village leaders, and the displacement of segments of the population.

“We must read this new dynamic of conflict involving civilians as a response by the jihadists of the Islamic State to locally organized community resistance,” Ibrahim said.

The scale of the recent killings is unprecedented. Until recently, the Islamic State group would target a few isolated individuals in retaliation for their collaboration with the government or with an enemy jihadist group.

In the current situation, the jihadists are now carrying out a collective punishment, Ibrahim said, where the whole community is targeted.

429,Congo’s Main Opposition Candidate Dies on Presidential Election Day,"Republic of Congo opposition leader Guy-Bryce Parfait Kolelas died Sunday, the same day the African nation held general elections in which Kolelas was a candidate.

Kolelas died on March 21 while being evacuated from a hospital in the Republic of Congo to a medical facility in France. He had been admitted to a hospital on March 20 after falling seriously ill with symptoms of the Chinese coronavirus, which he tested positive for on March 19. Kolelas “died in the medical aircraft which came to get him from Brazzaville [Republic of Congo] on Sunday afternoon,” according to his campaign director, Christian Cyr Rodrigue Mayanda.

“A video published on social media showed 61-year-old Kolelas, who was diabetic, appearing very weak,” Radio France Internationale (RFI) reported on March 22. The opposition leader is seen in the video clip removing an oxygen mask from his face to communicate a message to his supporters.

“I am in trouble. I am fighting death,” Kolelas said. “However, I ask you to stand up and vote for change. I would not have fought for nothing.” He added the Republic of Congo’s latest general election was “about the future of your children.”

Kolelas was one of six opposition candidates running against incumbent Denis Sassou-Nguesso, who has been the president of the Republic of Congo since 1997. Nguesso, 77, also served as the country’s president from 1979-1992.

“He [Kolelas] was runner-up to Nguesso in the 2016 presidential election, gaining around 15 percent of the vote, and was widely seen as Nguesso’s main political rival” in this year’s polls, RFI noted Monday.

Nguesso was re-elected president of the Republic of Congo on Tuesday with 88.57 percent of the vote, the country’s interior minister, Raymond Zephirin Mboulou, announced on state television on March 23. Nguesso will now start a new, five-year term as president. Guy Brice Parfait Kolelas received 7.84 percent of votes on Sunday, while opposition candidate Mathias Dzon won just 1.9 percent of the vote, according to the state government’s official tally.

Internet Without Borders, along with 49 other organizations, accused Nguesso of shutting down the internet in the Republic of Congo on the day of general election voting, March 21. The allegations prompted the Republic of Congo’s Catholic Church to issue a statement in which it expressed “serious reservations” about the general election’s transparency. The country’s largest opposition group, the Pan-African Union for Social Democracy, boycotted the election in protest of the internet blackout.",1
430,Tanzania: Tens of Thousands Pack Stadium to Honor Late President,"Tens of thousands of Tanzanians packed a stadium in Dar es Salaam to honor late Tanzanian President John Magufuli on Saturday.

Mourners lined the city’s streets on March 20 to watch as the late president’s casket was transferred via military vehicle from a Dar es Salaam church to Uhuru Stadium, where it lied in state over the weekend. Some Tanzanians laid clothing articles down on the road ahead of the motorcade procession, while others showered the casket in flower petals as it drove past. Once at the stadium, droves of Tanzanians visited Magufuli’s casket, pouring into the site to pay their respects to the late leader. Many people wept audibly as they walked past the coffin. Some were so overcome by emotion they fainted and military personnel carried them away on stretchers.

There was a stampede at Uhuru Stadium on Sunday as thousands of mourners rushed the site’s entryway for a chance to walk past the late president’s casket, according to the BBC, which reported the number of casualties from the incident was “not yet clear.”

Still images and video footage of the packed crowds at Uhuru Stadium over the weekend showed few people out of the tens of thousands wearing sanitary masks despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The lack of masking and social distancing was emblematic of Magufuli’s tenure as Tanzania’s president over the past year, during which he refused to lock Tanzanians down in quarantine or force citizens to wear masks in the face of the pandemic.

Magufuli’s lax attitude toward the Chinese coronavirus caused many Tanzanians and Africans to speculate that he had contracted the disease during his nearly three-week disappearance from public in the days preceding his death on March 17. The Tanzanian government’s initial refusal to comment on Magufuli’s uncharacteristic absence fanned rumors about the leader’s health status.

Tanzania’s new president — former Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan — announced Magufuli’s death, officially from a “heart illness,” last week, revealing he had been admitted to the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute in Dar es Salaam on March 6.

African heads of state gathered in the Tanzanian capital of Dodoma on Monday to pay their respects to Magufuli during the late president’s state funeral. Thousands of Tanzanians attended the ceremony inside a Dodoma stadium where masks and physical distancing were eschewed as they were in Dar es Salaam during Magufuli’s public viewing over the weekend.

The African continent is “saddened by the death of a revolutionary,” Democratic Republic of the Congo President Felix Tshisekedi told the crowd of mourners.

“He wasn’t just our leader, but also a guardian and parent to many … and an honest man,” Tanzanian President Hassan, sworn in on March 19, said at the funeral.",1
431,Egypt Prepares Move to Capital East of Cairo,"Egypt is scrambling to complete a new administrative capital east of Cairo in time to receive its first civil servants by July, the government confirmed this week.

“The rate of completion of the first phase has passed 60 percent across all projects,” Khaled el-Husseiny, spokesman for the new capital, said this week. The Egyptian government plans to transfer its first batch of government ministers to the city by July and officially open the new administrative capital by the end of 2021 as part of a greater plan to alleviate congestion in Egypt’s nearby national capital, Cairo.

The planned launches follow several pandemic-related delays and financial setbacks for Egypt’s new administrative capital. The Egyptian government planned to rely heavily upon the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) to fund the city’s construction when it first announced the venture in 2015. The Emirati funds fell through shortly afterward, however, forcing the Egyptian military and government to take on an estimated $25 billion cost to construct the capital’s first phase. Cairo also reached out to alternative foreign donors, including China, for additional off-budget funding.

“Some international financing has been secured for rail links, and a $3 billion Chinese loan has helped fund the business district, built by China State Construction Engineering Corp (CSCEC),” Reuters reported on March 17.

Egyptian Housing Minister Asem al-Gazzar announced on February 24 that “60 floors have been constructed thus far in the Iconic Tower, the tallest tower in Africa at 400 meters, in the New Administrative Capital’s central business district,” according to the Egyptian Independent.

“The would-be 385-meter high 80-floor Iconic Tower is expected to be the tallest skyscraper in Egypt and Africa upon completion,” Xinhua, China’s official press agency, reported last January.

“We have about 800 Egyptian engineers, 4,000 Egyptian workers, 800 Chinese engineers and 1,000 Chinese workers who are currently working in the project,” Chang Weicai, general manager of CSCEC Egypt, told Xinhua. He added that CSCEC had “cooperated with about 100 Egyptian local companies so far” to build the business district.

Chang hailed the CSCEC’s collaboration with Egypt on its new administrative capital as a landmark project for China’s infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which Egypt joined in 2016.

“Egypt now has a golden chance for economic development, and the CBD [Central Business District] joint project embodies both China’s BRI and Egypt’s Vision 2030 for future development,” Chang said at the time.

Reuters described more recent development in the city’s construction on Wednesday ahead of the capital’s upcoming launch.

“At the heart of the city, workers are putting finishing touches to an avenue of ministries that echo the architecture of pharaonic temples and adjoin a raised Islamic complex, two domed parliament buildings, and a sprawling presidential compound,” the news agency relayed. “There will be a monorail passing through a business district where a 385-meter central tower is close to completion. Beyond, the contours of a 10 km [6 mile] park stretching to a giant mosque are taking shape.”",1
432,Gunmen Kidnap Catholic Priest in Southern Nigeria,"Unidentified gunmen abducted a Catholic priest in Nigeria’s Delta State this week, the Premium Times reported Thursday.

The priest, Father Harrison Prhinyovaw, was driving near the town of Abraka Monday evening around 8:00 pm when the assailants held him up at gunpoint and abducted him, leaving his vehicle at the scene.

Prhinyovaw is the pastor of St. John’s Catholic Church, in the Ukwuani Local Government Area of Delta State, and was reportedly in transit from Warri back to his parish when he was kidnapped.

“The Catholic priest was meandering a bad spot in Oria-Abraka, Ethiope East Local Government Area of the state when he was returning to base from Warri in his Highlander Jeep,” said one local eye-witness to the abduction.

“The kidnappers shot sporadically in the air to scare away passers-by at the scene of the operation,” the witness said. “They abandoned the cleric’s car at the scene of the incident.”

Another auricular witness, a member of a local vigilante group, told journalists he and his colleagues had heard the gunshots fired by the kidnappers but did not see them or go after them.

“It looked like they came to fight a war. We have so far picked about 15 shells which are bullets from their AK-47 gun,” the witness told Oasis magazine.

Fellow Nigerian priest Father Ugochukwu Ugwoke also announced the kidnapping on Twitter, asking for prayers. He identified the missing pastor as Father Harrison Egwuenu, a priest of the Catholic diocese of Warri.

Delta State police spokesman Edafe Bright, the Deputy Superintendent of Police, confirmed authorities’ awareness of the incident, adding that a team of police officers had been assigned to the case.

433,Missing Tanzanian President Declared Dead of 'Heart Illness',"Tanzanian President John Magufuli has died at the age of 61 from a heart illness, Tanzanian Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan said on Wednesday.

“Dear Tanzanians, it is sad to announce that today 17 March 2021 around 6:00 p.m. we lost our brave leader, President John Magufuli, who died from heart disease at Mzena hospital in Dar es Salaam where he was getting treatment,” Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan said during a state television broadcast on March 17. Tanzania will now enter a two-week national mourning period for Magufuli, the vice president added.

Magufuli was admitted to the Jakaya Kikwete Cardiac Institute in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on March 6, Hassan said during her speech on Wednesday. The revelation puts to rest weeks of rumors surrounding Magufuli’s nearly three-week disappearance from the public eye since he was last seen on February 27 in Dar es Salaam during a ceremony at the Tanzanian State House. The Tanzanian government’s initial refusal to comment on the president’s whereabouts fueled speculation that he had fallen ill, with some alleging that he had contracted the Chinese coronavirus.

Vice President Hassan seemed to make cryptic references to Magufuli’s illness on Monday during a speech marking the launch of a government project in Tanga, a town in Tanzania’s northeast.

“It’s quite normal for a person’s body to be indisposed and contract the flu or develop a fever,” Hassan said on March 15, without clarifying to whom she referred. The vice president similarly acknowledged “rumors flying around” Tanzania during her speech, without specifying which rumors she referred to or what they claimed.

“As Tanzanians, we must work together, be united and build our nation. Most of the rumors you hear don’t originate in Tanzania … they come from outside the country. I ask you to ignore them. If it’s about prayers, pray, but all in all, we should remain united and take Tanzania forward. We’re safe,” Hassan said.

Tanzanian Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa claimed Magufuli was “safe” and working on March 12 while urging Tanzanians to “ignore fake news” concerning the president’s health status.

“The prime minister asked Tanzanians to be calm because President John Magufuli is safe and he is going about his work,” the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation quoted Majaliwa as saying.

Tanzanian security forces arrested at least four people for allegedly spreading “false information” about Magufuli’s health on social media in recent days, demonstrating the government’s desire to clamp down on speculation surrounding the head of state.

Magufuli’s death on Wednesday comes just five months after he won a second five-year term as Tanzania’s president in October in a disputed election. Magufuli was first elected president of Tanzania in 2015 after the country’s left-wing ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi, chose him to succeed former Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete. The former parliamentarian was nicknamed “The Bulldozer” for his aggressive leadership style, which saw him push through policies he championed despite opposition from government factions.

Magufli’s policies surrounding the Chinese coronavirus pandemic – which included blanket refusals to force Tanzanians into lockdown or to wear sanitary masks, and an endorsement of alternative remedies for coronavirus, such as prayer and steam inhalation – contributed to fervid speculation over the past few weeks that the president had contracted coronavirus during his disappearance from the public eye.",1
434,Mozambique: Children as Young as 11 Beheaded by Islamist Insurgency,"British-based charity Save the Children said Tuesday children as young as 11 years old have been beheaded by the savage ISIS-affiliated Islamist insurgency in Mozambique.

The terrorists are reportedly murdering children before the eyes of their helpless mothers.

Sky News quoted horror stories related to Save the Children by civilians in Mozambique, including a mother who hid in terror with three of her children while the insurgents murdered her 12-year-old eldest son, and a woman who watched the death of her 11-year-old boy.

The Mozambique insurgency calls itself Ahlu-Sunnah Wa-Jama, a name it borrowed from Somalia’s Al-Shabaab terrorist organization; some of the killers, and many terrified local citizens, simply refer to the militants as “al-Shabaab.” The insurgency grew out of a popular movement against corrupt government and foreign exploitation of Mozambique’s oil and gas resources, but its loyalties lie with the Islamic State.

The U.S. State Department formally designated the militants and their leader Abu Yasir Hassan, a Tanzanian national, as a terrorist organization last week. The designation identified them as “ISIS-Mozambique” and noted they pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in the spring of 2018. The State Department held them responsible for the deaths of over 1,300 civilians and the displacement of some 670,000 Mozambicans.

A dozen U.S. Army Green Berets arrived in Mozambique this week on a two-month mission to train local troops. The New York Times (NYT) on Monday described it as “the entry of the United States military into a counterinsurgency effort that has been aided so far mainly by South African mercenaries, who have faced accusations of human rights abuses.”

The NYT quoted a State Department insider who said the Green Beret training program “could lead to more ambitious American help for Mozambique’s military including combat casualty care, planning and logistics.”

“I don’t think anyone saw this coming. For this to crop up so quickly is concerning,” said U.S. Special Operations Africa deputy commander Col. Richard Smith.

The ferocity of the Mozambican insurgents may have intensified this year, but their appearance on the scene should not have come as a sudden surprise to anyone. After years of increasingly bloody activity, they launched their first major offensive in 2017, attacking the port city of Mocimboa da Praia, which they finally managed to conquer in 2020. The Islamic State began claiming responsibility for Mozambican atrocities in the summer of 2019.

The long-held strategic objective of the insurgency is taking control of the gas-rich province of Cabo Delgado, or at least making it so dangerous that foreign energy companies can no longer operate there. Beheadings have been a staple of their tactics for years; they reportedly beheaded 50 people in a mass atrocity in November 2020 and then hacked the bodies into pieces.

The BBC on Sunday described northern Mozambican villages as “cut off from the outside world by roving gangs of machete-wielding Islamist fighters” with a habit of hanging their butchered victims from trees, their severed heads balanced atop the bloody corpses. The jihadis generally behead male villagers while taking the women and girls as slaves, much like Boko Haram in Nigeria.

When one man escaped a village massacre and then tried to phone his brother to see if he was all right, a jihadi answered and said, “We killed your brother. We are afraid of nothing. We are al-Shabaab and we kill as we please.”

“We came here by foot with nothing. We were afraid. We saw al-Shabaab killing others with knives. There are many women I know who were abducted. There are many children in the camp here whose mothers were taken,” another refugee told the BBC.

The intensity of the ISIS-Mozambique campaign should come as no surprise to informed observers. The New York Times noted that 160 gunmen from the Wagner Group, the notoriously brutal Russian mercenary organization, flew into Cabo Delgado to protect its energy operations in 2019 and then flew right back out again after the insurgents killed seven of them.

South African mercenaries proved to have more staying power, but also more indiscriminate firepower, as international human rights groups accuse them of killing civilians while having little significant effect on the insurgency. The U.S. State Department this week dismissed the use of mercenaries as “a feature of the landscape in Cabo Delgado that complicates rather than helps efforts to address the terror threat there.”

Another complicating factor is the Mozambican government, which is almost as corrupt as the jihadis accuse it of being, and has a distressing habit of interfering with humanitarian aid shipments to the starving refugees of Cabo Delgado. Local residents told the BBC the police expect bribes before allowing them to eat. Factions within Mozambique’s political class accuse each other of supporting the insurgents.

Money for food and medicine sent by well-meaning foreign donors wound up supporting the corrupt government instead, with little visible effect on Mozambique’s grinding poverty, which helps the Islamists recruit fighters and market itself as a popular revolutionary movement.",1
435,"Tanzania: As President Nears One Month Missing, VP References 'Flu'","Tanzanian Vice President Samia Suluhu Hassan seemed to imply that Tanzanian President John Magufuli was sick on Monday amid unproven rumors that he may have contracted the Chinese coronavirus since he disappeared from the public eye last month.

“It’s quite normal for a person’s body to be indisposed and contract the flu or develop a fever,” Hassan said on March 15, without clarifying to whom she was referring. The vice president made the remarks at the launch of a government project in Tanzania’s northeastern town of Tanga.

Hassan likewise acknowledged “rumors flying around” Tanzania during her speech, without specifying which rumors or what they claimed; the vice president warned Tanzania’s citizens against trusting such “outside” information.

If it’s about prayers, pray, but all in all, we should remain united and take Tanzania forward. We’re safe,” she said.

President Magufuli was last seen in public on February 27 in Dar es Salaam during a government ceremony held at the Tanzanian State House. He has remained out of the public eye for over two weeks since then. The extended absence is unusual for Magufuli, as he regularly speaks at church congregations and political rallies. The Tanzanian government’s refusal to confirm Magufuli’s whereabouts over the past 17 days has fueled speculation that he may have fallen ill. Tanzania’s opposition party alleged without evidence on March 11 that Magufuli had been airlifted first to Nairobi, Kenya, and then to India to receive medical treatment after contracting the Chinese coronavirus.

Tanzanian Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa broke the government’s silence on Magufli’s status on March 12, claiming he was “safe” and working.

“The prime minister asked Tanzanians to be calm because President John Magufuli is safe and he is going about his work,” the Tanzania Broadcasting Corporation quoted Majaliwa as saying while urging Tanzanians to “ignore fake news.”

Police in Tanzania have arrested four people in recent days for allegedly spreading “false information” about Magufuli’s health via social media.

“[T]he Kilimanjaro Regional Police Force is said to be holding two people on suspicion of spreading false information on social media concerning senior government officials’ health, contrary to the law,” Tanzanian newspaper the Citizen reported on Monday. “This brings the number of suspects arrested in connection with spreading online fabricated information related to the health of President John Magufuli to four after two such cases were reported on Sunday [March 14] and Saturday [March 13].”",1

“I think that when we talk about establishing peace, and centering people’s humanities, protecting people’s rights, it’s not just about the ‘what’ and the end goal, which often gets a lot of focus. But I actually think it’s much more about the ‘how’ and the way that we are coming together and we interpret that ‘what’ and the actions that we take to get to that ‘what,’” Ocasio-Cortez told Rabbi Michael Miller, executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, on April 1.

“What this really is about is that it’s a question more than anything else about process. We really need to make sure that we are valuing a process where all parties are respected, and have a lot of equal opportunity to really make sure that we are negotiating in good faith.”

“The value of human rights is really the path to peace here,” Ocasio-Cortez told Miller.

“That’s a central thing that we need to make sure that we value the safety and the human rights of Israelis and we value the safety and human rights of Palestinians in that process that is similar on equal footing.”

“Just like here in the United States, I don’t believe that children should be detained. I think that starting on those basic principles of human rights, we can build a path to peace together.”

Critics on Twitter mocked Ocasio-Cortez for her response to Miller’s question, with one commenting: “This sounds like she is giving a oral book report in front of the class on a book that she has never read.”

Another Twitter user quipped: “She would have been better off with an interpretive dance.”

A third commented, “What about the Where? Have we considered The Who and the Whom? All while disregarding the Because.”

Last year, Jewish groups, including many leftwing ones, slammed Ocasio-Cortez for withdrawing from an event commemorating late-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Rabin, who was one of Israel’s most dovish leaders and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994.",1
437,"Ted Cruz, Republican Senators Say Biden Funding to Palestinians Violates Anti-terror Law","Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and seventeen other Republican Senators wrote to Secretary of State Tony Blinken on Thursday, objecting to the Biden administration’s plan to spend $250 million on the Palestinians, arguing that the proposal violates anti-terror law.

As Breitbart News noted Wednesday:

The Biden administration announced $250 million in spending Wednesday on the Palestinians, despite a 2018 law that prevents U.S. taxpayer dollars from supporting the Palestinian Authority while it pays stipends and pensions to terrorists and their families. … In 2018, President Donald Trump signed the Taylor Force Act into law, which prevents the U.S. from providing economic support and other funding to the Palestinian Authority while it continues to pay the families of deceased terrorists, or to pay terrorists in Israeli prisons — a policy referred to by critics as “pay-for-slay.” The Palestinian leadership, having refused to end the payments, lost U.S. funding. Trump also cut funding to the UNRWA because of concerns that it has supported terror. The Taylor Force Act allows for a limited set of humanitarian exemptions, such as funding for vaccination programs. Blinken claimed that “All assistance will be provided consistent with U.S. law,” but did not explain how the funding would comply with the Taylor Force Act. He also did not provide any evidence of reforms within the Palestinian Authority or UNRWA, nor did he mention any Palestinian effort to discourage terror or to stop incitement against Israel or Jews.

In the letter, Cruz and his collegues note that the Biden administration’s funding violates the Taylor Force Act because it is being used for public services, freeing money in the Palestinian Authority (PA) budget to continue supporting terrorists:

On March 18, the State Department transmitted an unpublicized report to Congress pursuant to its obligations under the TFA [Taylor Force Act], which confirmed that the PA has in recent years funneled hundreds of millions of dollars toward terrorists and their families, and that in 2019 alone the PA expressed its intention to spend approximately $342.6 million on such rewards. … On March 19, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report finding that for the fiscal years 2015-2019, when USAID was distributing Palestinian assistance, USAID “did not consistently ensure” that those grants would not be passed along to terrorist groups and terrorists. The GAO recommended that, should funding resume, USAID should “(1) verify prime awardees have procedures to ensure compliance with requirements before making subawards and (2) conduct post-award compliance reviews in time to make corrections before the awards end.” It also noted that “USAID agreed with the recommendations.” … The notification describes new assistance that would go towards, inter alia, “municipal roads,” “internal roads, sidewalks, safe and designated bus parking lots, and driving routes,” “reservoirs, pump stations, water distribution and transmission networks,” “basic commodities,” “emergency preparedness,” “community initiatives,” “safe spaces to engage in community initiatives,” and “building the resilience of the Palestinians to climate change and strengthening their adaptation to climate change.” These activities are the governance responsibility of the PA, and Congress prohibited American assistance to such activities against the backdrop of the PA using its available resources for pay-for-slay programs. In fact, Congress explicitly and narrowly enumerated in TFA what Palestinian governance programs should nevertheless still receive assistance: wastewater projects, childhood vaccination programs, and payments to East Jerusalem hospitals. The programs described in the March 26 USAID notification do not fit into those exceptions and so likely violate the TFA.

The State Department’s announcement of funding to the Palestinians on Wednesday came after weeks of speculation that the Biden administration was spending the money in secret to avoid public scrutiny or potential legal challenges to the policy.

438,Iran Blames U.S. for Coronavirus Vaccine Failure,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Thursday claimed the United States prevented Iran from buying millions of doses of coronavirus vaccine from India.

India halted all vaccine exports to anywhere in the world in late March as coronavirus cases spiked and domestic demand for vaccines surged.

“We have done what we should have done. We bought vaccines from India and we paid for it, but then they said ‘our Judiciary has gotten in the way and we cannot give you the vaccines,’” Rouhani claimed during a video conference on Thursday, specifically blaming former U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Trump dwarfed all the executioners of history as he started a war against the Iranian nation which had no boundaries, like a war that does not shy away from [using] chemical, microbial and nuclear weapons or [targeting] residential and non-residential areas,” Rouhani railed, as quoted by Iran’s state-run PressTV.

Rouhani called the U.S. “rebellious” and “lawless” for keeping sanctions in place during the coronavirus pandemic, but he also claimed the American “maximum pressure” campaign was a failure and Tehran remained unbowed.

Rouhani did not explain why his regime apparently has vast amounts of money available for huge missile bases, advanced uranium centrifuges, and foreign military interventions, but not medicine for its own people.

U.S. sanctions have always made exceptions for humanitarian assistance and medicine, although some critics of the sanctions say foreign suppliers remain nervous about triggering secondary sanctions by dealing with Iran. India slowed or halted most exports to Iran in early March because Iran’s supply of rupees ran low, delaying payments for months. India stopped buying Iranian oil after U.S. sanctions were reimposed in 2019.

Rouhani also appears to have forgotten Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s theocratic order banning the import of Western vaccines in January, greatly complicating Iranian medical supply chains because alternative non-Western suppliers must be secured.

In addition to doses of the British-Swedish Astra-Zeneca vaccine manufactured by India, and 150,000 doses of India’s indigenous-designed Covaxin vaccine that have already been delivered, Tehran has also purchased vaccines from Russia and China, and is participating in a trial of vaccines from Cuba. The Iranians have also boasted of creating their own vaccines, but no evidence exists that these have successfully passed clinical trials or are even in development in any way.

Despite this cornucopia of imports and promises to develop domestic alternatives with superior Iranian medical science, the Iranian Health Ministry admitted in March that its domestic vaccine rollout was a failure. The ministry blamed this failure on Russia, India, and America, while critics of the regime pointed to internal political battles, scapegoating, misappropriation of funds, and confusing messages from the theocracy like the Ayatollah’s vaccine ban. The Iranian medical establishment is also deeply skeptical of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, essentially dismissing it as a substandard and untested product Iran must settle for because it cannot obtain better alternatives.

India’s pause in vaccine exports, which is expected to last until June, combined with unexpectedly slow vaccine production in South Korea have created a supply problem for many participating nations in the United Nations-backed Covax program. Concerns have been raised that India may not be able to supply the billion doses it was contracted to provide.

Adar Poonwalla, head of the Serum Institute of India (SII), said Wednesday the institute is “prioritizing the needs of India,” but is “still short of being able to supply to every Indian.”

Poonwall in turn suggested part of India’s problem was a U.S. ban on exports of some crucial supplies — a result not of Trump administration sanctions against rogue states like Iran, but the Biden administration invoking the Defense Production Act to give American manufacturers priority access to those supplies. A global shortage of these materials was cited as one reason for the U.S. government to restrict exports.",1
439,Netanyahu: Israel Won't Be Bound by Deal that Gives Iran the Bomb,"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Israel would not be bound by a renegotiated nuclear deal with Iran that would see the Islamic Republic obtaining a bomb in a few years, and reiterated the Jewish State would do whatever it took to protect itself from regimes seeking its destruction.

Netanyahu delivered his remarks at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day.

“The nuclear deal with Iran is once again on the table. Such deals with extreme regimes are worthless.”

Referencing the indirect talks that have begun in Vienna, Austria, between the U.S. and Iran, Netanyahu said: “The nuclear deal with Iran is once again on the table. Such deals with extreme regimes are worth as much as garlic peel.”

He then issued an implicit but sharp rebuke to the Biden administration: “I say to our closest friends too: ‘A deal with Iran that threatens us with annihilation will not bind us.’ Only one thing will bind us: to prevent those who wish to destroy us from carrying out their plans.”

Iran has such military strength and experience in dynamic modern warfare no enemy can even dream of beating it, Major General Hossein Salami, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, declared Tuesday. https://t.co/Bu3wZ5IOZ8 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 30, 2021

“During the Holocaust we did not have the power to protect ourselves and we did not have the privilege of sovereignty. We had no rights, no state, and no defense,” the Israeli premier went on. “Today we have a state, we have the power to defend ourselves and we have the full right as the sovereign state of the Jewish people to protect ourselves from our enemies.”

Earlier this week, Breitbart reported key Israeli officials were “very troubled” by the American administration’s mixed messages regarding the deal.

Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley was accused by one official of “acting like he’s from the U.N.”

Blinken spoke on Friday with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi and according to a source with knowledge on the matter, the American diplomat said that a gradual approach with Iran that would lead to a “sharpened” nuclear deal. However, the official also said that opinions are split within the Biden administration.

Iran issues its orders to China Joe https://t.co/6rojrphcRh — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) February 7, 2021

The impression Blinken gave is that the Biden administration “is not pinning its hopes” on the talks in Vienna this week and is “not expecting a breakthrough.”

“They understand Iran is leaning toward refusing any new declarations or plans… Iran has a tough stance of returning to the JCPOA and removing all sanctions,” the official said.",1
440,U.N. Applauds Biden Admin for $250 Million Aid Gift to Palestinians,"The Biden administration was applauded Thursday by the U.N. agency for so-called Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, after it offered $250 million in funding while sidestepping a 2018 law that prevents U.S. taxpayer dollars from supporting the Palestinian Authority.

“UNRWA could not be more pleased that once again we will partner with the United States to provide critical assistance to some of the most vulnerable refugees across the Middle East,” the agency’s commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini, said in a statement seen by AFP.

“The U.S. contribution comes at a critical moment, as we continue to adjust to the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic presents.”

As Breitbart News reported, the State Department’s announcement of the funding flow confirmed weeks of speculation about a “quiet” effort to restart finance for the Palestinians — even as the American public struggles during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic:

Joe Biden is about to pour almost $100 million into Palestinian areas, while the Palestinians continue to pay for terrorists who murder Israelis & Americans. He kept it from the American public. It's deeply troubling, to say the least. https://t.co/ejBh50vsjn — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) March 31, 2021

Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the U.S. plans included $75m in economic and development assistance in the West Bank and Gaza, $10m for peacebuilding programs through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAid), and $150m in humanitarian assistance for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).

The direct Palestinian aid – with no concessions asked for or offered in return – is in direct contrast to the position taken by former U.S. President Donald Trump.

In 2018 he signed the Taylor Force Act into law, which prevents the U.S. from providing economic support and other funding to the Palestinian Authority while it continues to offer stipends for the families of deceased terrorists, or to pay terrorists in Israeli prisons — a policy referred to by critics as “pay-for-slay.”

The Palestinian leadership, having refused to end the payments, as a consequence lost U.S. funding.

Trump also cut funding to the UNRWA because of concerns that it has supported terror. The Taylor Force Act allows for a limited set of humanitarian exemptions, such as funding for vaccination programs.

The Biden decision to earmark millions in Palestinian support drew particular anger from Israel, which argues the agency serves to perpetuate the idea of a Palestinian refugee problem in a way that undermines the Jewish state.

Palestinians never concealed their contempt for Trump or his support of Israel.

Palestinians hailed the end of “the worst era” of President Donald Trump’s administration on Saturday night, saying “an evil has distanced itself from us” and calling the incumbent “dangerous and destructive.” https://t.co/109Z4Z6gEr — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 8, 2020

“We believe that this U.N. agency for so-called ‘refugees’ should not exist in its current format,” said the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Gilad Erdan.

“I have expressed my disappointment and objection to the decision to renew UNRWA’s funding without first ensuring that certain reforms, including stopping the incitement and removing anti-Semitic content from its educational curriculum, are carried out,” Erdan said.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric welcomed the restored U.S. assistance, and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said it “sends the right signal” amid growing needs due to the coronavirus pandemic.

441,Islamic State Women Suspected of War Crimes After Returning to Sweden,"Six female Islamic State members who have returned to Sweden in the past year after being held in prison camps in Syria are suspected of participating in war crimes.

The six women, all members of Islamic State who came back to Sweden in the last year after leaving to join the terror group in the Middle East, are under investigation for potential participation in war crimes, according to Prosecutor Reena Devgun.

Devgun told broadcaster Sveriges Radio that while prosecutions for war crimes committed overseas are difficult cases, extensive documentation of Islamic State crimes could aid the investigation into the women’s actions.

Swedish Terror Expert: It’s Very Difficult to Prosecute Returned ISIS Members https://t.co/F4E1Bsnuh5 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 5, 2020

The proceedings would be the first of their kind in Sweden as the type of crimes the women are being investigated for have not been tried in the country, making the case challenging for prosecutors. So far, none of the women has been arrested, and all but one have denied any participation in criminal activity.

Despite the accusations, some Swedes have called for the return of all Islamic State women held in the notorious al-Hol prison camp in Syria.

Journalist and author Jan Guillou has argued: “According to a number of international conventions, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, Sweden is responsible for its Swedish citizens among the prisoners, including these 25 women and 30 children.”

“This would scarce be a busload of women and children, all in mortal danger. Transport would be easy to arrange, decisions on the matter even easier, and the cost a trifle. It is much more expensive to help home all the drunks who have lost their passports or been robbed on their holidays abroad,” he wrote.

He also argued that if the women were guilty of crimes, they should be tried in a Swedish court. But terror experts such as Magnus Ranstorop have decried the lack of effective laws that could be used to prosecute returning Islamic State members.

Sweden’s counter-terrorism law, which was enacted in 2020, had seen zero arrests by March of this year because, according to prosecutor Per Lindqvist, charges were too difficult to prove.",1

443,Iran: We're Not Talking to Biden Unless U.S. Lifts All Sanctions,"Officials in Iran once again debunked claims by the U.S. State Department and friendly media that the Biden Administration is in “indirect” talks with Tehran on Wednesday, stating the Islamic regime has nothing to discuss without an end to every American sanction on the rogue state.

State Department spokesman Ned Price confirmed Monday that President Joe Biden approved travel for his top Iran envoy, Robert Malley, to Vienna, Austria, where the remaining signatories to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal would be meeting this week. While Price claimed Malley would be in town for “indirect” talks with the partners in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iranian officials quickly dismissed this claim, asserting that “no representative from the United States will attend the Joint Commission meeting or related expert meetings and no direct and indirect negotiations with the United States are on the agenda of Iran’s delegation.”

Iranian officials Wednesday again repeated their clarification that they are not in discussions with any representatives of the Biden administration and that they will only address the Americans if the United States repeals all existing sanctions on Iran. Iran is currently classified as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, which imposes one of the most stringent lists of sanctions available to American diplomats. The classification is not connected to any sanctions imposed under President Donald Trump for violations of the nuclear deal or other sanctions related to human rights abuses against the Iranian people, but Tehran insists they all be repealed together.

“From Iran’s viewpoint, all American sanctions — including the Obama-era sanctions, the sanctions restored by Trump and the additional sanctions in the Trump-era labeled as non-nuclear — must be terminated,” an unnamed “senior” Iranian official told PressTV, an Iranian state media outlet. “Iran’s condition for returning to its JCPOA commitments is the lasting removal of all the entire sanctions.”

Malley, the Biden envoy, is staying in a separate hotel from where the JCPOA meeting is occurring and reportedly has no contact with Iranian diplomats, yet pro-Biden American news outlets have claimed a diplomatic breakthrough is underway in Vienna. The countries actually invited to the meeting — Russia, China, Germany, France, the UK, and Iran — concluded their talks on Tuesday and will not meet again until Friday. They reportedly agreed “to establish two expert-level working groups, one to work on the lifting of sanctions and the other to work on nuclear issues,” according to Iran’s PressTV.

“Iran and U.S. Agree on Path Back to Nuclear Deal,” the New York Times claimed in a headline Wednesday. A CNN analysis applauded that Biden would “spiritually” be involved in the meeting.

“The talks are an important goal for Biden, who was vice president when President Barack Obama struck the original deal and who has surrounded himself with advisers who took part in the lengthy negotiations,” the Washington Post observed, after having admitted that no “talks” between Tehran and Washington are actually occurring.

An opinion piece at NBC News by an expert who admits in the piece to sharing dinner with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani celebrated that the talks, involving no American representatives and resulting in no concrete results, allowed “Biden to fix Trump’s mess.” Trump withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018 due to Iran’s consistent violations of the provisions of the agreement.

“The Vienna talks may be our last chance to restore the deal. The clock is ticking,” the column breathlessly predicts, without clarifying that the United States was not invited and is not participating in the talks.

PressTV and other Iranian outlets such as Mehr, Fars, and Tasnim have, in contrast, portrayed the Vienna talks as a matter between Iran and JCPOA signatories like China and Russia, not America. PressTV highlighted the Chinese envoy’s aggressive demands that Washington lift all sanctions at the meeting.

“The justified request of the injured party, rather than the offending party, should be confirmed and satisfied first. This is a basic right-or-wrong question. The US should lift all sanctions against Tehran and on this basis, Iran can resume full compliance to the nuclear deal,” Wang Qun, China’s envoy in Vienna, told reporters Tuesday, according to PressTV.

Russia, one of Iran’s closest international allies, expressed reservations on calling the Vienna talks a success, rather than focusing on pressuring Washington.

“It is too early to talk about a major breakthrough,” Russian representative at the meeting Mikhail Ulyanov said Tuesday, according to the Russian news agency Tass, noting that there are about 1,500 individual sanctions currently on the Iranian regime, all of which Tehran wants removed.

Price, the State Department spokesman, described Tuesday’s talks as “constructive” and “welcome,” with little emphasis on America’s absence there.

“It is a potentially useful step as we seek to determine what it is that the Iranians are prepared to do to return to compliance with the stringent limitations under the 2015 deal and, as a result, what we might need to do to return to compliance ourselves,” Price suggested.

Talks are scheduled to resume Friday, also without the Biden administration present.

444,Top EU Officials Meet with Turkish Islamist Prez in Bid to Thaw Relations,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel met with Turkish President Recept Tayyip Erdogan to discuss migration and thaw recent rocky relations.

The meeting took place in the Turkish capital of Ankara and saw the two top European Union officials meet with the Turkish president following Erdogan’s change in tone towards the EU in January, in which he spoke of mending ties with the political bloc.

According to a report from German newspaper Münchner Merkur, the European Union has offered Turkey a “restart” on relations that could include increased economic cooperation and financial support to the country.

Turkish President Erdogan Claims He Wants Improved Relations with EU https://t.co/PjNpDvkbpO — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) January 15, 2021

The offers come despite concerns voiced by President von der Leyen and President Michel over Turkey’s domestic situation, particularly as it concerns human rights and democracy.

Last month, a Turkish prosecutor has recently moved to disband the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) after accusations that the party had been working with Kurdish militants. The HDP has denied the allegations, however.

Just days later, Turkey withdrew from a European treaty aimed at protecting women from violence. The move was labelled “devastating” by Council of Europe Secretary-General, Marija Pejčinović Burić.

Commission President von der Leyen spoke of a “good first meeting” and claimed that Turkey was looking for “constructive” dialogue with the EU.

She added that a range of topics was discussed during the three-hour meeting, including customs union modernisation, visa travel for Turkish citizens into the EU, and more financial aid for the approximately four million Syrian refugees living in Turkey.

Macron Warns Turkey Will Interfere in 2022 French Presidential Election https://t.co/bQRE7756Bn — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 26, 2021

Since the signing of the EU-Turkey migration deal in 2016, the EU has already offered the Turkish €6 billion (£5.1 billion/$7.1 billion) to pay for Syrian refugees.

The meeting comes after months of tense relations between several European Union member states and the Turkish government.

Erdogan and his government have conflicted with Greece over migration and Turkish research vessels in the Eastern Aegean and has also been at odds with French President Emmanuel Macron following his crackdown on Islamists groups after the murder of teacher Samuel Paty.

Last month, Macron stated that he expected the Turkish government would interfere with next year’s French presidential elections, saying: “Obviously, there will be attempts at interference for the next election. They’re written, and the threats are not veiled.”

In February, the Netherlands’ counter-terror office expressed concern over President Erdogan’s links to radical Islamists in the country.

445,"Half Year After Trump-Brokered Peace Deal, Sudan Scraps Israel Boycott Law","Six months after the Trump administration brokered a normalization deal between Israel and Sudan, Khartoum on Tuesday moved to scrap a decades-old Israel boycott law.

Cabinet ministers voted to abolish the 1958 law, which penalized violators with heavy fines and up to 10 years jail time for infractions such as conducting trade with Israelis.

“The council of ministers approved a bill repealing the 1958 boycott of Israel law,” the Sudanese prime minister’s office said in a statement, adding that ministers also reiterated “Sudan’s firm position on the establishment of a Palestinian state within the framework of a two-state solution.”

The Palestinian leadership slammed the news Sudan and Israel were working towards building ties as a “stab in the back.”

Tuesday’s bill will be presented before Sudan’s cabinet and the ruling sovereignty council before being made into law.

Khartoum has also promised Jerusalem it would abolish a law calling for the imprisonment of former migrants returning to Sudan, opening the way for thousands of Sudanese migrants in Israel to go back to their home country.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year noted Sudan is “an Arab, or rather a Muslim country, speaking Arabic, that hosted the Khartoum Conference. And in Khartoum they have all the no’s against Israel. Remember the no’s? No recognition, no Israel basically.”

Sudan was one of four Muslim and Arab countries to normalize relations with Israel as part of the so-called Abraham Accords led by the Trump administration. As part of the deal, Sudan was removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.",1
446,Baghdad Cardinal Calls for Separation of Religion and State in Iraq,"Iraqi Cardinal Louis Raphaël Sako issued a bold proposal Monday for the establishment of a secular state in Iraq, separating religion from government “as the Christian West has done for a long time.”

“A civil or secular state is not hostile to religion and respects all faiths, but does not include it in politics,” Cardinal Sako said, proposing Iraq adopt a model “that guarantees freedom of religion and worship for all Iraqis equally and protects the human rights contained in all international treaties.”

Timing his proposal for the one-month anniversary of Pope Francis’s historic visit to Iraq, the cardinal said that “Iraqis of all faiths and religions must make the most of this visit to turn over a new leaf and usher in a new season of human fraternity and reconciliation.”

Sako, who is the Chaldean Patriarch of Baghdad, was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Francis in 2018, a move viewed by many as recognition for his leadership during the years of harsh persecution under the Islamic State terror group.

In his proposal, the cardinal stated that “all Iraqis, by principle and by constitution, are fully citizens with the same rights and duties. Citizenship cannot be limited to religion, creed, region, race, or number. Citizenship is a universal right for all.”

“Every individual can follow his own religion and traditions,” he said, “provided that he respects the religion of his brother, not treating him as a non-believer, or betraying him, or excluding or eliminating him. Such diversity flows from the will of God.”

“Human fraternity is the ultimate aspiration of all societies and religions, and it should be a cornerstone for rejecting extremism and hatred, for changing our mindset and outlook,” Sako said, “with a view to building mutual trust and moving forward together as brothers and sisters embracing tolerance, love, and respect for diversity.”

While the Iraqi constitution formally provides for freedom of religion, it stipulates that no law may conflict with Islam, which in practice often leads to discrimination against minorities, leading Christians and other religious minorities to describe their situation as “second-class citizens.”

Of Iraq’s population of approximately 39 million, at least 98 percent are Muslims. Roughly two-thirds of these are Shiites living in the south of the country and the other third are Sunni Muslims in the center and Kurdish Sunnis in the north.

Among Christians, the largest group are Chaldean Catholics, but there are also Assyrians of the East, Syrian Orthodox, and Syrian Catholic, as well as Armenian Apostolic and Armenian Catholic.

Iraq is also home to other religious minorities, often in combination with ethnic diversity, such as Yazidis, Sabbateans, Mandeans, Kakai, and Zoroastrians.

447,Saudi Arabia to Allow Only 'Immunized' Pilgrims to Mecca,"Only people “immunized” against the Chinese coronavirus will be allowed to perform the Islamic Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca starting next week, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported on Monday.

Only pilgrims who have received two doses of a coronavirus vaccine, received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine at least 14 days prior to arrival in Mecca, or contracted and recovered from the Chinese coronavirus, are allowed to perform Umrah. The mandate will go into effect on the first day of Ramadan, which is a month-long Islamic fasting holiday starting on April 12 this year.

The immunization requirement also applies to people seeking to pray in Mecca’s Grand Mosque or the nearby Prophet’s Mosque in Medina, Islam’s second holiest city, according to a press release by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah on April 5.

The Umrah is an optional pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam’s holiest city, that may be performed any time of year. It remains unclear whether the immunization requirement will apply to pilgrims seeking to perform the obligatory Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, which is required once in a Muslim’s lifetime and is expected to be held later this year in July.

Saudi’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah said the new immunization requirement stemmed from a decision to “to increase the operational capacity of the Grand Mosque in Makkah [Mecca].” Saudi Arabia allowed only a limited number of pilgrims to perform the Hajj pilgrimage last July due to concerns over the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Just 1,000 Saudi residents were allowed to participate in last year’s Hajj, a fraction of the 2.5 million Muslims from around the world who took part in the pilgrimage in 2019.

The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah reopened Mecca’s Grand Mosque and Medina’s Prophet’s Mosque in October 2020 following a seven-month suspension of worship at the sites due to the pandemic.

“More than 13 million worshippers wearing masks and observing physical distancing rules have visited the mosques since the seven-month prayer and Umrah suspension was lifted last October,” Arab News reported on April 6.

The severely restricted capacity of last year’s Hajj coupled with the cancellation of most Umrah pilgrimages in 2020 cost Saudi Arabia an estimated $4.6 billion. The Hajj alone typically generates $6 billion for the Kingdom’s highly lucrative religious tourism industry. The sum is “equivalent to about 2.7 percent of Saudi Arabia’s gross domestic product,” according to Bloomberg.

Saudia Arabia’s King Salman relieved former Hajj Minister Mohamed Benten of his duties via royal decree on March 12, replacing him with Saudi state minister and cabinet member Essam bin Saad bin Saeed. Although no reason was given for the replacement, Benten oversaw the decisions to close Mecca and Medina’s main mosques at the height of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic last year and scale back the 2020 Hajj.",1
448,Jordan Orders Media Blackout on Rift Between King and Former Crown Prince,"Jordanian public prosecutor Hassan al-Abdallat issued an order Tuesday banning all Jordanian media outlets from reporting on the rift between King Abdullah II and his half-brother, former Crown Prince Hamza, ostensibly because any coverage of the royal dispute would jeopardize investigations of a seditious plot with which Hamza was supposedly involved.

The order was issued after Hamza signed a declaration of renewed allegiance to the king and agreed to “mediation” of his dispute with the court. The mediation will supposedly be overseen by Prince Hassan bin Talal, Hamza’s uncle and something of an elder statesman in the royal family.

Hassan, like Hamza, was once next in line for the throne, holding the position from 1965 until his brother, King Hussein, bumped him from the position in 1999 for allegedly trying to destabilize the government and set himself up to take power — largely the same offenses Hamza is accused of today.

Hussein proceeded to test Hassan’s good humor even further by dying of cancer less than a month after ending Hassan’s 34-year-run as the designated successor to the crown. The newly-designated Crown Prince Abdullah became King Abdullah II and rules Jordan to this day. Five years after taking the throne, Abdullah replaced Hamza as crown prince and designed his own son as heir.

“I place myself in the hands of his majesty the king,” said the statement of loyalty Hamza signed on Monday after meeting with Hassan. “I will remain committed to the constitution of the dear Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.”

The letter was released to the public by the palace on Monday, but then public prosecutor Hassan al-Abdallat banned further discussion of the royal rift on Tuesday to “keep the security services’ investigation into Prince Hamza and the others secret.”

“The ban on publication involves all audio-visual media and social networks, as well as the publication of all images or video clips relating to this subject on pain of legal action,” the order stated.

Police have arrested another 16 people to date for allegedly conspiring with unnamed foreign powers to destabilize the Jordanian government. Hamza himself claimed to be under house arrest in a video smuggled to foreign media, but the government is striving not to portray him as a defendant or detainee.

Jordanians remain befuddled by the split in the normally stable monarchy. Hamza’s supporters see him as a voice of the people and suspect the king cracked down on him, arresting many of his friends and allies, to keep him from growing more popular. Hamza’s visits to coronavirus patients have been cited by Jordan-watchers as a reason for the king to conclude the former crown prince was undermining his authority by turning public opinion against the crown.

Despite Hamza’s public pledge of allegiance, the BBC judged on Tuesday that the “crisis is not over yet.”

“Many holes in the alleged plot remain. The identities and ambitions of all people detained have not been made public. Nor is it clear which foreign entities may have wanted to destabilize the kingdom. Whatever happened was serious enough for Jordan’s allies and neighbours, including other Arab monarchies, to race to express full support for King Abdulla,” noted BBC analyst Lyse Doucet.",1
449,Iran Denies It Will Talk to U.S. After Biden Admin Invites Itself to Vienna Meeting,"The government of Iran denied it would engage the United States in talks on Tuesday after the administration of President Joe Biden confirmed on Monday that it would send an envoy to Vienna, Austria, where the remaining signatories of the Iran nuclear deal are scheduled to discuss a path forward.

“No negotiations will take place between the representatives of Iran and the United States,” Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters on Tuesday, according to Iran’s Mehr News Agency.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry elsewhere emphasized, “no representative from the United States will attend the Joint Commission meeting or related expert meetings and no direct and indirect negotiations with the United States are on the agenda of Iran’s delegation.”

Rabiei insisted that no talks would occur between Washington and Tehran unless the United States lifted all sanctions imposed on the Islamic regime in response to its extensive human rights violations and its development of an illegal nuclear weapons program.

The 2015 Iran nuclear deal – formally the “Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action” (JCPOA) – is an agreement between Iran and Britain, China, France, Germany, and Russia allegedly designed to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon. America was a signatory to the deal under President Barack Obama, but President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018, describing it as unfair and accusing Iran of repeatedly violating its provisions.

The Biden administration’s State Department leadership claimed on Monday that it would engage in “discussions” with Iranian officials in Vienna, but not “direct” ones, on how to find a role for America in the deal, potentially leading to the reversal of Trump-era sanctions on the regime.

“[The talks] will be structured around working groups that our European – that the EU is going to form with the remaining parties to the JCPOA, and that includes Iran. The primary issues to be discussed are actually quite simple,” State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters. “They’re, on the one hand, the nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order for Iran to return to that desired end state – and again, that is an end state of compliance with the JCPOA – and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order for us to return to compliance with the JCPOA.”

“These discussions, we fully expect, will be difficult,” Price added, “but we do believe that these discussions with our partners and, in turn, our partners (discussions) with Iran, are a healthy step forward.”

“Now, we don’t anticipate at present that there will be direct talks with Iran, though, of course, we remain open to them,” he added, “And so we’ll have to see how things go starting early this week.”

U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley, Biden’s top Iran diplomat, will reportedly lead the U.S. delegation to Vienna. The delegation will not be staying in the same hotel as the officials in town for the JCPOA talks and it is unclear exactly what they will be doing there, or if the European leaders welcomed its presence at all.

While confirming that Tehran had no interest in speaking to Malley, Rabiei, the Iranian regime spokesman, declared his presence a victory on Tuesday.

“Today we are witnessing a new chapter in the process of defeating coercion and reviving the JCPOA,” Rabiei told reporters. “As we predicted at the height of the Trump administration’s bullying and pressure, the United States eventually, frustrated by the wrong path, admit that maximum pressure has failed and that there is no choice but to revive the JCPOA and get all parties back to their commitments.”

“This success would never have been achieved if we had not stood up to the Trump regime in spite of all external and internal pressures to leave the JCPOA, and if our people had not endured this severe suffering,” the spokesman asserted. “Today, we are confident that in the very near future, the US government will have no choice but to end its lawless conduct, and that unilateral sanctions which are in violation of international agreements and regulations will end.”

Rabiei added that Iranian representatives would address American counterparts only after the elimination of sanctions on the regime.

PressTV, an Iranian government media outlet, cited a “source close to the Iranian negotiating team” on Monday that similarly claimed, “Tehran will not accept any outcome of the Vienna meeting other than the removal of all sanctions,” meaning it would not negotiate at all.

“Robert Malley will have to leave Vienna empty-handed if the Tuesday meeting would result in anything other than the removal of all U.S. sanctions,” according to the alleged “source.”

Public statements from Iranian officials have not wavered from this demand.

“The agenda of this [joint] commission meeting is the removal of all U.S. cruel sanctions against Iran, and in other words, clarification of how parties [to the deal] should fulfill their commitments,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Monday. “The path is clear. All US sanctions [against Iran] must be removed at once. Then [this measure] must be verified [by Tehran] and only then, the Islamic Republic will take its step [to return to full commitments under the nuclear deal].”

Iran is not offering the other members of the JCPOA anything in exchange for their demand that the United States, no longer a party to the JCPOA, lift sanctions.

450,"Rivlin Asks Netanyahu to Form Israeli Government, Notes Low Chance of Success","Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Tuesday handed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the mandate to form a government but cautioned it was not likely the premier would be successful because he lacked support.

Rivlin has given Netanyahu 28 days to form a government but the recurring election deadlock makes it unlikely Netanyahu will succeed.

No party leader in Israel has gained enough support to secure the 61-seat majority needed to form a coalition.

“I am under the impression that none of the candidates have a chance to form a coalition,” Rivlin said.

Rivlin noted the absurdity of being tasked with appointing a candidate to form a government five times during his term as president which began seven years ago. Israel held its fourth national election in two years last month, and a fifth looks increasingly likely.

Fifty-two members of Knesset from four parties recommended Netanyahu, while 45 from five parties recommended Netanyahu-rival and Yesh Atid head Yair Lapid.

The rightwing Yamina party, which scored seven seats, recommended its leader and kingmaker Naftali Bennett. Likud defector Gideon Sa’ar’s New Hope party as well as the two Arab parties that cleared the electoral threshold, Ra’am and Joint List, declined to recommend anyone.

Rivlin noted the “moral and ethical” problem with asking Netanyahu to form a government, in light of the Israeli leader’s corruption trial.

“I know the position held by many, that the president should not give the role to a candidate that is facing criminal charges. But according to the law and the decision of the courts, a prime minister can continue in his role even when he is facing charges,” he said.

“The president of the State of Israel is not a substitute for the legislature or for the judiciary,” added Rivlin.

Netanyahu attended the first day of testimony in his corruption trial on Monday, accusing the left and the judiciary of mounting a coup attempt.

Israel’s longest serving prime minister, Netanyahu has been in office since 2009 and also served a previous term from 1996-1999.",1
451,Pope Francis Issues ‘Urgent’ Invitation to Lebanese Prime Minister,"ROME — Pope Francis has sent an “urgent” invitation to Lebanese Prime Minister-Designate Saad Hariri to meet with him in the Vatican, local media reported late Monday.

The purpose of the meeting would be to help mediate between President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri (pictured) in the formation of Lebanon’s new government.

On Sunday, an MP from the Future Movement — founded by Hariri — called on President Aoun to cooperate with the Prime Minister-designate to rescue the country threatened with a economic collapse by agreeing to a cabinet of nonpartisan specialists with no veto power granted to any side.

In late 2019, Hariri resigned as prime minister following mass protests concerning the country’s woeful economic situation. He was again designated as prime minister on October 22, 2020, but has failed to form a government since then.

On Easter, Pope Francis thanked Lebanon publicly for its role in generously “taking in many refugees who have fled from the conflict in Syria.”

Protest-hit Lebanon has approved an economic rescue plan and requested aid from the International Monetary Fund as it battles its worst financial crisis in decades. https://t.co/sc9vUa8aY1 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) May 6, 2020

“May the people of Lebanon, who are undergoing times of difficulty and uncertainty, experience the consolation of the Risen Lord and find support from the international community in their vocation to be a land of encounter, coexistence and pluralism,” the pontiff stated.

Lebanon’s financial crisis has been worsening by the day and on March 16, the exchange rate reached 15000 Lebanese pounds to the dollar.

On March 29, speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri warned that Lebanon could sink like the Titanic if no government is formed.

In an address to a parliamentary session, Speaker Berri compared Lebanon to the doomed luxury liner. “If it sinks, everyone will drown,” he said. “The time has come to wake up because in the end, if the ship sinks, no one will survive.”

After five months and 18 meetings between Hariri and Aoun, no government has yet been formed, a crisis that the pope seems determined to remediate.

452,Israeli Official: New Biden Stance on Iran ‘Very Troubling’,"The Biden administration’s mixed messages regarding the nuclear deal ahead of indirect talks with Iran are “very troubling,” the Jerusalem Post cited senior Israeli officials as saying, with one accusing Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley of “acting like he’s from the U.N.” and not a representative of the American people.

The remarks came in the wake of Malley’s comments to PBS Friday, after the U.S. announced that it would join indirect talks with Iran beginning next week in Vienna.

Malley (pictured) told PBS the U.S. would “have to lift [the Trump administration’s] sanctions that are inconsistent….with the deal that was reached with Iran… so that Iran enjoys the benefits that it was supposed to enjoy under the deal.”

The entire interview was couched in terms of equivalence, with Malley repeatedly expressed his concern over the U.S. and Iran’s “mutual distrust” as well as the need for a “mutual return” to compliance with the deal.

A senior Israeli official said: “If this is American policy, we are concerned.”

The interview, he went on, “raised eyebrows” at the highest levels in Israel because it was a departure from Secretary of State Anthony Blinken’s own pledge to secure a “longer and stronger” deal.

“In the past, the Biden administration talked about a ‘longer and stronger’ deal – like they were looking for something else – and that’s not [in the Malley interview]. It’s all about returning to the 2015 deal,” the source said.

Joe Biden has appointed former anti-Israel activist Maher Bitar to the role of senior director for intelligence programs at the NSC. https://t.co/nuzop7xGxG — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) January 27, 2021

“Nowhere in the entire interview does Malley say the goal is to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons,” he said. “Nowhere does he accuse the Iranians of any bad behavior… Nowhere in the interview does he talk about the importance of consultations with American allies in the region.”

“In the old deal, snapback sanctions disappear in 2025,” the Israeli official added. “In 2030, all nuclear restrictions end. Even the Europeans say it’s terrible that Iran is developing uranium metal. That becomes legal in 2030. Is that the deal they want to go back to?”

Malley told PBS: “The goal is to see whether we can agree on what steps the United States needs to take to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal and what steps Iran has to take to come back into compliance with the nuclear deal.”

“It’s not a matter of who has the greater weight,” Malley said. “It’s whether both sides are prepared to carry the burden that they have to come back into compliance.”

He further warned against the U.S. or Iran being too rigid in their positions.

“If either side takes a maximalist position and says that the other side has to do everything first before it’s going to move one inch, I think it’s hard to see how this succeeds,” he said.

The Post cited the Israeli official as saying: “He’s acting like he’s from the UN, saying both sides have distrust of each other.”

He added the Biden administration may see “a moment of opportunity because there is no government in Israel,” and believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would not respond to the Vienna talks since his focus has been on domestic matters, including the election deadlock.

However, as the Post noted, the Israeli premier will be giving major public speeches in the coming weeks, on Holocaust Remembrance Day and Remembrance Day for the Fallen of Israel’s Wars, occasions on which he traditionally warns against Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

Blinken spoke on Friday with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi and according to a source with knowledge on the matter, the American diplomat said that a gradual approach with Iran that would lead to a “sharpened” nuclear deal. However, the official also said that opinions are split within the Biden administration.

The impression Blinken gave is that the Biden administration “is not pinning its hopes” on the talks in Vienna this week and is “not expecting a breakthrough.”

“They understand Iran is leaning toward refusing any new declarations or plans… Iran has a tough stance of returning to the JCPOA and removing all sanctions,” the official said.",1
453,Jordan Arrests Ex-Crown Prince for Plot to ‘Destabilize’ Government,"Jordan accused former Crown Prince Hamza bin Hussein over the weekend of allegedly conspiring with “foreign parties” to “destabilize” the country.

In an unusual example of palace drama for the relatively stable monarchy, Hamza issued a video statement through his lawyer in which he said he was under house arrest and has been ordered not to communicate with the outside world, an order he said he would not obey.

41-year-old Hamza, the oldest son of the late King Hussein and younger half-brother to current ruler King Abdullah II, was named Crown Prince of Jordan in 1999. It was widely understood at the time that King Hussein favored Hamza, but he was too young to assume control at the time of his father’s death, so he was formally designated next-in-line. This was a great disappointment to his mother Queen Noor, the king’s fourth wife and reportedly his favorite, as she had been grooming Hamza to take the throne after his father’s death.

In 2004, King Abdullah decided to strip Hamza of his title, passing it instead to his own oldest son Al Hussein bin Abdullah II. The king said he did this to “free” Hamza from “the constraints of the position of crown prince in order to give you the freedom to work and undertake any mission or responsibility I entrust you with.”

Most observers of the royal court assumed King Abdullah wished to consolidate power into his wing of the family. Lineage is particularly important to the Jordanian royal family because it claims to be directly descended from Islam’s Mohammed.

Hamza appeared to take his demotion reasonably well, voicing occasional criticism of government policies but rarely seen as a serious rival to the new crown prince or an aggressive threat to the throne. His attitude might have changed in recent years as he became close to a political movement called the Herak, a tribal coalition that styles itself as pro-democracy activists and accuses the Jordanian monarchy of corruption.

The Herak became influential after the Arab Spring uprisings of 2011. Their influence surged again during the coronavirus pandemic, as they accused the monarchy of mismanaging the coronavirus response and its economic fallout. Protests against King Abdullah have grown so widespread over the past few months, spurred by unemployment reaching 30 percent and a scandal over coronavirus patients dying because a hospital ran out of oxygen, that Jordanian security services began warning of serious threats to the stability of the monarchy.

Evidently, the government decided former Crown Prince Hamza was one of those threats, arresting 15 people over the weekend for their alleged involvement in a “malicious plot” against the throne.

On Sunday, after a day of confused and often conflicting statements from government officials, Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi directly accused Hamza of being involved with the plot. Safadi said Hamza, former finance minister Bassem Awadallah, and another member of the royal family called Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, had launched a plan to disrupt “the security and stability of the nation” in a palace coup with foreign backing.

Safadi described this plan as an imminent threat to the government and said communications had been intercepted between Hamza and Awadallah in which the plotted “incitement and efforts to mobilize citizens against the state in a manner that threatens national security.”

“The investigations had monitored interferences and communications with foreign parties over the right timing to destabilise Jordan,” Safadi said in a televised news conference. “Initial investigations showed these activities and movements had reached a stage that directly affected the security and stability of the country, but His Majesty decided it was best to talk directly to Prince Hamza, to deal with it within the family.”

Safadi accused Hamza of breaking from “the traditions and values of the Hashemite family” by refusing to cooperate with the “amicable” investigation. He said Awadallah was trying to flee the country at the time of his arrest and was trying to arrange for Hamza’s family to evacuate as well.

The Jordanian military denied arresting Hamza, but said he was instructed to “stop activities that are being exploited to target Jordan’s security and stability.”

A former U.S. official told Reuters the plot under investigation by the military was not a traditional “physical coup,” but rather an effort to destabilize Jordan by organizing a “popular uprising with masses on the street,” drawing upon the close relationship Hanza has forged with the Herak movement and some tribal leaders. Hamza is very popular with some disgruntled tribes, in part because he has a strong physical resemblance to his father, the late King Hussein.

Other sources inside the Jordanian government implied Hamza and his co-conspirators were supported by parties within Saudi Arabia, in part because these Saudis have some financial interest in complicated and rather murky plans to privatize billions of dollars in Jordanian infrastructure. The Saudi monarchy officially stated its “full support” for King Abdullah after news of the arrests in Jordan broke.

Hamza sent a video statement to the BBC through his lawyer in which he claimed he was under house arrest, by order of the top officials in Jordan’s military, intelligence services, and police.

“I’m making this recording today to try to explain what has happened over the last few hours with me. I had a visit from the Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Armed Forces this morning in which he informed me I was not allowed to go out, to communicate with people, or to meet with them,” he said.

“I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance, the corruption and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years and has been getting worse,” Hamza said in response to the allegations against him.

“And I am not responsible for the lack of faith people have in their institutions,” he continued. “It has reached a point where no-one is able to speak or express opinion on anything without being bullied, arrested, harassed and threatened.”

Hamza promised he would not “make moves and escalate now,” but also vowed to disobey orders to isolate himself from the public and remain silent. He insisted he was not “part of any conspiracy, or nefarious organization, or foreign-backed group,” but presented himself as one of the royals who “still love this country” and put the welfare of its people “above all else.” His video pointedly refrained from criticizing the king by name, instead blaming the corrupt “ruling system” for Jordan’s problems.

Hamza’s mother Queen Noor al-Hussein entered the controversy with an unusually barbed statement of support for her son on Sunday:

Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander. God bless and keep them safe. — Noor Al Hussein (@QueenNoor) April 4, 2021

“We are closely following the reports and in touch with Jordanian officials. King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support,” the U.S. State Department said in response to the crisis.",1
454,Biden Administration to Hold Indirect Talks with Iran in Vienna,"Diplomats announced Friday that the Biden administration will hold “indirect” talks with the Iranian regime in Vienna, Austria, next week, toward restoring the Obama administration’s nuclear deal, which the Trump administration left in 2018.

The New York Post reported:

Officials from Tehran and Washington will travel to Vienna next week as part of efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and global powers, though they will not hold direct talks, diplomats said on Friday. … “Iran and the US will be in the same town, but not the same room,” a European diplomatic source said. A Western diplomat said a shuttle diplomacy approach would be adopted.

Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif confirmed the news on Twitter:

At virtual JCPOA JC meeting, Iran & EU/E3+2 agreed to resume in-person talks in Vienna next Tues. Aim: Rapidly finalize sanction-lifting & nuclear measures for choreographed removal of all sanctions, followed by Iran ceasing remedial measures. No Iran-US meeting. Unnecessary. — Javad Zarif (@JZarif) April 2, 2021

President Joe Biden ran for office promising to return to the deal. The Biden administration has been trying to entice Iran back to the table, partly by distancing itself from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two regional Iranian rivals.

The two sides disagree about whether the U.S. should lift sanctions first, or whether Iran should cease nuclear enrichment first, before negotiations can be started again.

Under the original Iran deal, Iran received sanctions relief, access to up to $150 billion in frozen assets, and billions in cash. In return, it agreed to temporary restrictions on its nuclear program, which it could resume fully after roughly a decade.

Critics — including Israel and the Sunni Arab states directly threatened by Iranian ambitions — noted that the deal did not require Iran to end its ballistic missile program, to stop supporting terrorism, or to curtail its effort at regional domination.

In 2018, Israel presented an intelligence trove that it had seized from Iran, revealing that the regime had misled the world about its nuclear ambitions, and that it continued to seek nuclear weapons, even after the nuclear deal had gone into effect.

455,DOJ: Couple Arrested While Allegedly Trying to Travel to Join ISIS,"A couple was arrested this week in Newark, New Jersey, on criminal charges regarding their alleged attempt to provide material support to ISIS, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said Thursday.

“According to court documents, James Bradley, 20, of the Bronx, New York, and Arwa Muthana, 29, of Hoover, Alabama, are ISIS supporters who attempted to travel to the Middle East to join and fight for ISIS,” the agency stated.

Bradley has allegedly voiced support for the terrorist group and his desire to be part of it overseas or commit a terrorist attack in America.

“Bradley and his wife, who has also expressed her support for ISIS, were arrested while attempting to travel together by cargo ship to the Middle East to join and fight for ISIS. Bradley and Muthana were presented before U.S. Magistrate Judge Debra Freeman in Manhattan federal court today,” the press release said.

Muthana is reportedly the sister of Hoda Muthana, who left Alabama in 2014 to join the terrorist group, according to CBS 42.

In November 2019, a federal judge sided with then-President Donald Trump’s administration by ruling she was not a U.S. citizen and had no way to return.

“As Breitbart News reported, Hoda Muthana is appealing for help to escape Syria and bring her son to America to start her life again,” the outlet said at the time.

The DOJ’s recent news release continued:

Bradley and Muthana are charged with one count of attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; and one count of conspiring to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which also carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

Bradley and his wife “have now learned their alleged attempts to fight on behalf of ISIS, inside the U.S. or overseas, instead begin with two pairs of FBI JTTF handcuffs and court appearances in lower Manhattan,” Assistant Director-in-Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. for the FBI’s New York Field Office stated.

“Our goal is to interdict violence before it occurs, and once again I commend the work of the FBI-NYPD Joint Terrorism Task Force personnel who work 24/7 to keep their fellow citizens safe,” he concluded.",1
456,Egypt Loses $1 Billion from Suez Canal Blockage,"Lt. Gen. Oussama Rabie, head of the Suez Canal Authority, said at a press conference on Thursday the blockage of the Suez Canal by the container ship MV Ever Given imposed a billion dollars in damages on Egypt.

Lawsuits stemming from the incident will probably take years to resolve, as some $50 billion in global trade was disrupted by the six-day blockage.

Rabie said the ship is currently being held in the Bitter Lakes near the canal while the accident is investigated. Cairo political science teacher Said Sadek told Voice of America News that investigation could be very sensitive, both because of the massive lawsuits certain to flow from the accident, and lingering questions about what might be carried aboard the gigantic ship and its thousands of shipping containers:

“If it is not done, big trouble, because in this case, according to international law and Suez Canal law, the goods [on the ship] will be confiscated,” Sadek said. “And so, if there is anything inside, it will be revealed. … If there are children [being trafficked], if there are nuclear bombs, it will be revealed.” The ship is expected to be detained for two weeks. Sadek said both Egyptian and international investigators were at work on the case. “Now this ship is under scrutiny, and they will not leave the [lakes region] where they are now being kept until all investigations are done,” he said. “There will have to be agreement [about] who will pay the damages. We’re talking about billions of dollars that will have to be paid.”

One major lawsuit has already been filed: the owners of the Ever Given, two Japan-based companies called Luster Maritime and Higaki Sangyo Kaisha, are suing the company that operates the ship, Taiwan’s Evergreen Marine Corp, at the High Court in London.

The Suez Canal Authority has prohibited the Ever Given from leaving the Suez Canal area until a full investigation of the incident is completed. Satellite photos on Friday showed the ship anchored near the east side of the Great Bitter Lake awaiting a hull inspection. Evergreen optimistically stated the ship could “resume its scheduled service” once the hull inspection is complete.

The same set of satellite photos showed heavy traffic once again moving steadily through the Suez Canal. Well over 400 ships were backed up outside the canal during the blockage, and the canal generally handles about 50 ships per day, so it will take some time for the backlog to clear up completely.

Lt. Gen. Rabei said at his press conference that the captain of the Ever Given has not yet provided requested documents or the ship’s black box. Egyptian media sources reported on Thursday the ship has been involved in two previous accidents, but no details were provided. Egyptian legal experts said the ship could be confiscated by the Egyptian government if the captain and crew do not cooperate fully with the investigation.

The current status of the Ever Given’s 25-man Indian crew is uncertain. Two Egyptian canal pilots who were aboard the ship could be part of the investigation as well. Indian government and shipping industry officials fear the crew could be arrested and “made scapegoats” for the incident.",1
457,Lebanon Lifts Coronavirus Test Requirement for Vaccinated Travelers,"Lebanon will no longer require travelers entering the country to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for the Chinese coronavirus if they have already been vaccinated against the virus, authorities announced on Wednesday.

Travelers who have received a complete dosage of a Chinese coronavirus vaccine are no longer required to present a negative PCR test result to enter Lebanon via the airport or land and sea borders, Lebanese health minister Hamad Hasan said in a statement on March 31.

“Travelers must present an official certificate proving that they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus and that they received their second dose [of a two-dose vaccine] at least 15 days prior to their arrival in the country,” Al Arabiya noted on Thursday. People who have only received a single dose of a two-dose vaccine are still required to present a negative PCR test result.

Lebanese authorities previously required all travelers to the country to present a negative PCR test for the Chinese coronavirus upon arrival. A PCR test is used to detect the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 – the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease, i.e. the Chinese coronavirus – within a person’s nasal cavity or throat. A PCR test result may be available within minutes if the sample is tested onsite.

The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) warned on March 8 that countries should not require international travelers to present “vaccine passports” during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, as this would be unfair to people from countries with limited vaccine availability.

“Vaccination is just not available enough around the world and is not available certainly on an equitable basis,” Dr. Michael Ryan, director of the W.H.O. Health Emergencies Program, told reporters at a press briefing.

The W.H.O. currently advises against the use of coronavirus vaccine passports, as “real practical and ethical considerations” surrounding their implementation remain, Ryan added.

The United Nation’s official health body believes coronavirus vaccine certification as a condition for travel would be unfair to people who cannot be vaccinated for various reasons. Requiring travelers to present a coronavirus “vaccine passport” to move about freely in the world would potentially allow “inequity and unfairness (to) be further branded into the system,” Ryan said.

The European Union (E.U.) recently proposed a coronavirus vaccine passport called a “Digital Green Certificate” that E.U citizens would be required to present in order to travel within the bloc.

“The Digital Green Certificate is digital proof that a person has either been vaccinated against COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus], received a negative test result, or recovered from the virus. It will be in digital or paper format that contains a QR code with a digital signature to protect against forgery and falsification and is completely free,” the European Commission said in a statement on March 17.",1
458,Report: Abbas’ Party List for Palestinian Elections Includes Terrorists,"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ ruling Fatah party has included convicted terrorists as well as the relatives of terrorists in senior positions on its list for May’s parliamentary elections, Israel’s Kan public broadcaster reported Thursday.

Number two on Abbas’ party list is the widow of the terrorist responsible for the vicious 2001 attack on a 10-month-old Israeli baby, Shalhevet Pass, during the second intifada.

The tenth spot is a former security prisoner from Jenin who was incarcerated over the murder of an Israeli civilian, Moti Biton, in the 1990s. The prisoner was released as part of a gesture of goodwill to Abbas in 2013.

A second security prisoner who was later released in another deal secured fifteenth place on the list. The man, from the West Bank city of Hebron, received a life sentence for his involving in terror attacks during the second intifada.

Abbas rival and infamous Palestinian terrorist Marwan Barghouti has also drawn up his own list of candidates in the upcoming election to challenge the PA president. Barghouti himself is serving a life sentence for multiple acts of terrorism.

His list likewise includes terrorists, including former prisoner Fakhari Barghouti, who was served a life sentence for murdering an Israeli bus driver Mordechai Yekuel in the late 1970s. He was later released as part of the 2011 deal to released captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.

Kan also reported Abbas has so far refused to accept a telephone call from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with Abbas reportedly insisting that President Joe Biden personally call instead.

The Palestinian legislative elections are scheduled for May 22, while presidential elections are set for July 31.",1
459,Christians Mark Good Friday in Holy Land as Some Sites Reopen,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Christians in the Holy Land are marking Good Friday this year amid signs the coronavirus crisis is winding down, with religious sites open to limited numbers of faithful but none of the mass pilgrimages usually seen in the Holy Week leading up to Easter.

The virus is still raging in the Philippines, France, Brazil and other predominantly Christian countries, where worshippers are marking a second annual Holy Week under various movement restrictions amid outbreaks fanned by more contagious strains.

Last year, Jerusalem was under a strict lockdown, with sacred rites observed by small groups of priests, often behind closed doors. It was a stark departure from past years, when tens of thousands of pilgrims would descend on the city’s holy sites.

This year, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was crucified, died and rose from the dead, is open to visitors and expecting a few dozen. After the morning prayer service they will retrace Jesus’ final steps along the Via Dolorosa.

“Things are open, but cautiously and gradually,” said Wadie Abunassar, an adviser to church leaders in the Holy Land. “In regular years we urge people to come out. Last year we told people to stay at home… This year we are somehow silent.”

Israel has launched one of the world’s most successful vaccination campaigns, allowing it to reopen restaurants, hotels and religious sites. But air travel is still limited by quarantine and other restrictions, keeping away the foreign pilgrims who usually throng Jerusalem during Holy Week.

Israeli authorities said up to 5,000 Christian Palestinians from the West Bank would be permitted to enter for Easter celebrations. Abunassar said he was not aware of any large tour groups from the West Bank planning to enter, as in years past, likely reflecting concerns about the virus.

Abunassar said most Christians in the region celebrate Holy Week in their local parishes. The Good Friday services in the Old City are only expected to draw a small number of people, mainly priests and foreigners who reside in the Holy Land.

At the Vatican, Holy Week events are being celebrated before limited numbers of masked faithful to respect COVID-19 health and social distancing norms.

In France, a nationwide 7 p.m. curfew is forcing parishes to move Good Friday ceremonies forward in the day, as the traditional Catholic night processions are being drastically scaled back or cancelled. Nineteen departments in France are on localized lockdowns, where parishioners can attend daytime Mass if they sign the government’s “travel certificate.”

Although a third lockdown “light” is being imposed Saturday, French President Emmanuel Macron has wavered on a travel ban for Easter weekend, allowing the French to drive between regions to meet up with family on Friday.

Fire-ravaged Notre Dame will not hold a Good Friday mass this year, but the cathedral’s “Crown of Thorns” will be venerated by the cathedral’s clergy at its new temporary liturgical hub in the nearby church of Saint-Germain-l’Auxerrois.

In the Philippines, streets were eerily quiet and religious gatherings were prohibited in the capital, Manila, and four outlying provinces. The government placed the bustling region of more than 25 million people back under lockdown this week as it scrambled to contain an alarming surge in COVID-19 cases.

The Philippines had started to reopen in hopes of stemming a severe economic crisis, but infections surged last month, apparently because of more contagious strains, increased public mobility and complacency.

In Australia, masked churchgoers sat in rows of socially distanced chairs at a street in Sydney as actor Timothy Watkins carried a cross in his portrayal of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ during a Good Friday observance.",1
460,"Biden Administration Reverses Trump Stance, Says West Bank is ‘Occupied’ by Israel","In a reversal of the Trump administration’s stance on the matter, President Joe Biden’s administration on Wednesday said that Israel does indeed “occupy” the West Bank.

The State Department’s newly released annual report on human rights “does use the term ‘occupation’ in the context of the current status of the West Bank,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said.

“This has been the longstanding position of previous administrations of both parties over the course of many decades,” he said.

In 2018, the Trump administration renamed the section on “Israel and the Occupied Territories” as “Israel, Golan Heights, West Bank and Gaza.” The move came after then-U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman reportedly asked the State Department to stop referring to the West Bank as occupied.

A year later, as reported by Breitbart News, the State Department again deleted the word “occupation” in reference to the West Bank in its annual country report on global human rights.

The new report released Tuesday did not change the language used by the Trump administration, which raised questions about whether the Biden administration was adopting its predecessor’s policy.

The head of the State Department’s human rights department, Lisa Peterson, said that “Israel, West Bank and Gaza” was an easier term to understand geographically.

In November 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. no longer views Israeli settlements as a violation of international law – breaking with decades of U.S. policy. He was also the first Secretary of State to visit a Jewish settlement in the West Bank.

In October 2017, then-U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman attended a business forum in an official capacity in the West Bank settlement town of Ariel, the first such visit from a U.S. government representative.

Altering the U.S. stance on the West Bank, known by Israelis by its biblical name, Judea and Samaria, was among the slew of pro-Israel decisions adopted by the Trump administration, which included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the embassy there as well, as recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.",1
461,Hawley: Democrat ‘Gun Crisis’ Efforts ‘Really About Confiscating Weapons’,"Thursday on FNC’s “The Ingraham Angle,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) insisted efforts by Democrats to take on what President Joe Biden earlier in the day deemed a “gun crisis,” and a “public health crisis” had more to them than was being revealed.

Hawley told fill-in host Pete Hegseth that Democrats, as they had stated during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign, were interested in confiscating weapons and ultimately taking away one’s right to bear arms.

“This is really about confiscating weapons. I mean, this is what the left has wanted to do for a long time. This is what half the presidential candidates or more on the Democrat side ran on just a year ago, in their primaries, and at the end of the day, the only way to make work with Biden and the others want to do, and the legislation they propose is to have a national gun registry, and ultimately to take away firearms from law-abiding citizens. That is where this is headed. That’s what many of them have been open, many Democrats have been open about wanting to do is anti-gun activists who he is trying to put it the ATF that’s what that’s what he wants to do.”

“So, this is where it’s headed,” Hawley continued. “And can I just, by the way, say that this idea that somehow cracking down on the Second Amendment is going to help revitalize economic prospects for the working class. This from Joe Biden, the guy who has presided over millions of jobs going to China, who has thought that that’s a great deal, whose economic policies and the Obama-Biden Administration hollowed out the working class. And now he says if I take away your right to bear arms, that that’ll be good for you economically. I mean, it’s just this is insanity.”

462,"Manchin: I Support Biden’s Gun Orders, Don’t Support House Background Check Bill","During an interview with CNN on Thursday, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said that he supports President Joe Biden’s executive orders on guns, but cannot support the House’s background check bill as it currently stands.

Manchin said, “I support what the president did today, from what I heard, okay, what he’s doing on executive order. Now, there [are] an awful lot of things that he talked about, but the executive order says ghost guns should not be allowed to be legally made or sold or used. It’s illegal. Because they’re making them off of printers and you can’t detect them.”

He added that he can’t support the House’s background check bill the way it’s currently written, “But, you know, that’s negotiations.”

Manchin also weighed in on whether he’d support the nomination of David Chipman to head the ATF by stating, “Everything I know, he is well qualified, and I have no reason why I would not. But I don’t know enough yet. He’s just been nominated today. We’ll look into that and go through the process. But I’ve always been very deferential about the president putting his team together.”

463,Joe Biden Declares ‘No Amendment to the Constitution Is Absolute’ in Gun Control Speech,"President Joe Biden declared Thursday that “no amendment is absolute” while unveiling a series of executive actions targeting American citizens’ Second Amendment rights.

“Today, we’re taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis,” Biden announced in a speech at the White House’s Rose Garden, claiming: “Nothing, nothing I am about to recommend in any way impinges on the Second Amendment.”

“No amendment, no amendment to the Constitution is absolute,” the president continued. “You can’t yell ‘fire’ in a crowded movie theater — recall a freedom of speech. From the very beginning, you couldn’t own any weapon you wanted to own. From the very beginning that the Second Amendment existed, certain people weren’t allowed to have weapons.”

Joe Biden should be ashamed. pic.twitter.com/IhMVbrGRDe — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 8, 2021

Biden then called it “bizarre” to criticize his executive actions as “contrary to the Constitution.”

As part of his orders, Biden directed the Department of Justice to write laws requiring background checks for homemade “ghost guns.” The president also requested the DOJ develop a model for “red flag” laws for states as a guideline. Additionally, he announced the nomination of gun control advocate David Chipman to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). However, in announcing his pick, Biden referred to the federal agency as the “AFT” — twice.

“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic,” Biden said in his remarks, calling the situation “an international embarrassment.”

“The job of any president is to protect the American people, whether Congress acts or not,” the president added. “I’m going to use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there’s much more that Congress can do to help that effort.”

Biden’s orders swiftly prompted West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey (R) to threaten to sue the Biden administration.

“Defending the Second Amendment remains one of the most important priorities for the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. I will not allow the far left to run roughshod over our citizens’ gun rights. If President Biden follows through on his proposals, we will be in court very quickly,” Morrisey said in a statement. “Gun violence and the senseless death attributed to it should pain all Americans, however, the evil acts of a select few should never be a catalyst for stripping the lawful masses of their constitutional rights, especially their right to self-defense and to bear arms.”

It’s likely other Republican attorney generals will follow through with their own warnings to the Biden administration. Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) pledged to protect Texans’ Second Amendment rights after Biden reaffirmed his call on Congress to pass legislation aimed at banning “assault weapons” in the wake of the deadly Boulder, Colorado, grocery store shooting.

“Ahmad Al Aliwi Alissa murdered 10 people in Boulder, CO. Biden immediately called for a ban on ‘assault weapons.’ Dems enthusiastically agree. Let me be clear: As long as I’m AG, the left will *never* be allowed infringe on Texans’ 2A rights,” Paxton tweeted at the time.",1
464,WH Fact Sheet: AR-Pistols with Stabilizer Braces are 'Concealable',"The gun control fact sheet distributed by the White House claims AR-pistols with stabilizer braces are “concealable,” and cited that alleged concealability as a reason the firearms should face a higher level of regulation.

The White House fact sheet says: “The alleged shooter in the Boulder tragedy last month appears to have used a pistol with an arm brace, which can make a firearm more stable and accurate while still being concealable.”

The word “concealable” is relative, at best, in this context, and perhaps misleading. While it is certain that some AR-pistols with stabilizer braces can be concealed in tall backpacks or other bags, they cannot be concealed on a person’s body the same way a traditional pistol or revolver can.

During his speech, Biden also claimed that AR-pistols are “more lethal” if they have a stabilizer brace. He did not provide an explanation for his claim of greater lethality.

Biden’s end goal is to have AR-pistols with stabilizer braces placed under the purview of the National Firearms Act. This could mean that owners of such firearms would be required to be fingerprinted and photographed, undergo a background check and pay a $200 tax to the federal government, register their firearm with the ATF, and wait nine to ten months for that entire purchasing process to take place.

465,Elizabeth Warren: 'The Senate Must Finally Act' to Impose Gun Control,"The Senate “must finally act” to impose gun control measures at the federal level, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) said Thursday following President Biden’s speech unveiling his executive actions on guns.

“I was sworn in just weeks after Sandy Hook. I thought the Senate would listen to the American people and do something about gun violence,” she said, accusing Republicans of “working for” the National Rifle Association (NRA), which the left routinely demonizes.

“President Biden is right: the Senate must finally act,” she said:

I was sworn in just weeks after Sandy Hook. I thought the Senate would listen to the American people and do something about gun violence. But year after year, tragedy after tragedy, the @SenateGOP keep working for the @NRA. President Biden is right: the Senate must finally act. https://t.co/Wgl9WUpCE1 — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) April 8, 2021

Biden formally unveiled his executive action on guns in a Thursday address, deeming gun crime in the U.S. an “epidemic” and referring to it as an “international embarrassment.” Biden plans to use the Department of Justice (DOJ) to pave the way for gun control action with “red flag” laws, directing the department to craft a model for states to adopt.

The 78-year-old commander-in-chief is focusing on three additional facets related to the issue, including “ghost guns,” the recategorization of AR-15 pistols, and “DOJ-led research into gun trafficking,” as Breitbart News detailed.

“They’ve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers, members of Congress, but they’ve passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence,” Biden said during the address. “Enough prayers, time for some action.”

Watch:

The White House

Biden also expressed hope Congress would work to make gun control laws a reality.

“No matter how long it takes, we’re going to get these passed,” he vowed. “We’re not going to give up.”",1
466,7 Awkward Moments from Joe Biden’s Gun Control Announcement,"President Joe Biden took the bully pulpit Thursday at the White House to push for more gun control, slipping into his trademark misstatements, “brain freezes,” and awkward turns of phrase.

Here are seven of the strangest moments from Biden’s Rose Garden speech:

1. “Pistol” or “pencil”?

“A stabilizing brace used in a pencil [sic] essentially makes that pistol hell of a lot more accurate than many rifles,” Biden said. “As a result, it’s more lethal, effectively turning it into a short-barreled rifle.”

Joe Biden holds up his imaginary pistol with a hand brace that “essentially” turns it into a ""mini rifle.” pic.twitter.com/G4SxIJ3m6K — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) April 8, 2021

2. Sorry Jill! “Our son,” not “my son”

During his speech, Biden apologized to his wife Jill Biden for referring to his deceased son Beau Biden as “my son” instead of “our son.”

“I’m proud that the red flag laws in my home state of Delaware was named after my son, Attorney General Beau Biden — our son, excuse me, Jill,” he said.

3. Rewriting history

“For that 10 years we had it done, the number of mass shootings actually went down,” Biden said of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban passed in 1994 which expired in 2004.

Fact-checkers frequently rebut politicians and media figures on this claim, describing it as “half-true” or “unclear.” The Washington Post gave Bill Clinton “three Pinocchios” for making the same argument.

4. Joe Biden dreams of God granting him one gun control law

“If I get one thing on my list, the Lord came down and said, ‘Joe you get one of these, gimme that one.’ Because I tell you what, there would be a come-to-the-Lord moment these folks would have real quickly.”

5. “No amendment to the Constitution is absolute.”

Joe Biden asserted that the Second Amendment was not “absolute” asserting that at America’s founding citizens were not allowed to “own any weapon they wanted to own.”

Joe Biden should be ashamed. pic.twitter.com/IhMVbrGRDe — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) April 8, 2021

“They are phony arguments suggesting that these are Second Amendment rights at stake from what we are talking about but no amendment, no amendment is absolute.”

6. Joe Biden botches a description of the “gun show loophole.”

“Most people don’t know you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check. But you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want and no background check,” he said.

The vast majority of gun show vendors are licensed dealers who require background checks. Only private person-to-person sales do not require a background in states that do not have universal background check laws.

7. Joe Biden refers to the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms) as the “AFT” — twice!

“Today I’m proud to nominate David Chipman to serve as the director of the AFT [sic],” Biden said. “David knows the AFT [sic] well.”",1
467,Joe Biden Breaks Promise to Put Beto O’Rourke in Charge of Gun Control,"President Joe Biden broke his 2020 promise Thursday to put former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) in charge of gun control efforts. Instead, he named gun control activist David Chipman to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

The White House announced Chipman’s appointment as one of six executive actions that President Biden is taking on gun control, ahead of any effort to pass a bill acceptable to Congress (original emphasis):

The President will nominate David Chipman to serve as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. ATF is the key agency enforcing our gun laws, and it needs a confirmed director in order to do the job to the best of its ability. But ATF has not had a confirmed director since 2015. Chipman served at ATF for 25 years and now works to advance commonsense gun safety laws.

That violates an explicit promise Biden made O’Rourke, in public, at the Dallas event on March 2, 2020, when the former congressman — who had long since dropped out of the presidential race — endorsed Biden.

Biden’s exact words to O’Rouke then were:

I want to make something clear. I’m going to guarantee you this is not the last you’re seeing this guy. You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me. You’re going to be the one who leads this effort. I’m counting on you. I’m counting on you. We need you badly. The state needs you. The country needs you. You’re the best.

O’Rourke was quiet Thursday about Biden’s gun control efforts, tweeting instead about Texas voting reform legislation.

468,Republicans Warn: Democrats Now 'Want to Take Your Guns',"Democrats and Republicans in Congress provided mixed reactions to President Biden’s announcement about executive actions concerning guns Thursday; Democrats praised the measures as “progress,” while Republicans warned it is just the beginning of the radical left’s efforts to “take your guns.”

In an address Thursday, Biden described U.S. gun violence as an “epidemic” and “international embarrassment.” His executive actions, as the White House outlined, focus on “ghost guns” and directing the Department of Justice to publish a model of “red flag” legislation for states, which allow family members or law enforcement to “petition for a court order temporarily barring people in crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or others.” Meanwhile, Biden is also urging Congress to pass a national “red flag” law.

Biden said during his address he will “use all the resources at [his] disposal as President to keep the American people safe from gun violence.” Congress, he added, must act, as well.

“They can do it right now. They’ve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers, members of Congress, but they have passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence,” he said, contending it is not a partisan issue.

“This is not a partisan issue among the American people. This is a view by the American people as an American issue. And I’m willing to work with anyone to get these done. And it’s long past time that we act,” Biden said.

However, the announcement drew sharp partisan reactions, as Democrats expressed gratitude for Biden’s actions and the GOP warned of massive government overreach.

“When it comes to the sickening gun violence in our streets we have a choice: give up or stand up,” Sen Dick Durbin (D-IL) said in a statement.

469,Joe Biden Stresses Background Checks for Guns as Hunter Biden Accused of Lying on Gun Form,"President Joe Biden issued several new executive orders and actions on Thursday aimed at gun control — while his son, Hunter Biden, is accused by critics of having violated federal law by lying about his past drug use in a background check for a gun.

The gun was part of a domestic dispute that reportedly involved the Secret Service. It later disappeared.

As Breitbart News reported last month:

Politico managed to obtain a copy of the Firearms Transaction Record and a receipt for the gun in question, dated Oct. 12, 2018. It asked, “Are you an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance?” Hunter answered “no” despite his history of drug use — something that ultimately had him discharged from the Navy Reserve. “Lying on the form is a felony, though prosecutions for it are exceedingly rare,” Politico reported, adding that neither Hallie Biden nor Hunter’s lawyer provided a comment on the matter.

The Firearms Transaction Record is part of a routine background check for gun purchases from federally-licensed firearms dealers. Hunter Biden has documented his intense drug use in a new memoir that was released this week. At one point, he told an interviewer, he smoked parmesan cheese, mistaking it for crack cocaine.

President Biden, lamenting the cost of gun violence, spoke Thursday at the White House about the importance of making background checks stronger. He cited his other son, the late Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden, who pushed for “red flag” laws that would allow authorities to take away the guns of people who had been identified as mentally unstable.

“Hundreds of thousands of people have been denied guns because of background checks,” Biden said, stressing the need. He said that the “vast majority” of the American people and “responsible gun owners” supported stronger background checks.

He did not address the fact that his other son, Hunter Biden, faces questions about allegedly lying in his background check.

470,Portland to Spend $1.4 Mil. on 'Unarmed' Patrols to Fight Gun Crime,"Portland, Oregon’s City Council approved $1.4 million for “unarmed” patrols to be stationed in parks to fight gun crime.

KGW reports there will be “two dozen” such patrols, working a schedule that ensures someone is working “around-the-clock.”

The money for the “unarmed” patrols is part of a larger $6 million plan intended to fight gun violence in the city. The largest portion of the money–$4.1 million–“will be earmarked for community groups that work in the neighborhoods hardest-hit by gunfire.”

None of the money okayed by the City Council will go to the police.

The Associated Press quoted Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler (D) reacted to the approved funding: “We agree that the immediate spike in gun violence is a public health threat that requires a public health response that invests in community-based organizations working to change the conditions and environments that foster violence.”

There have been more than 250 shootings in Portland thus far in 2021. That is a greater than 100 percent increase over the 111 shootings in Portland at this same time in 2020.

471,"White House: Biden Will Not Wait on Congress, Using DOJ for Gun Control","On April 7, 2021, the White House released a fact sheet announcing that President Joe Biden will use the Department of Justice (DOJ) to publish model red flag “legislation,” address AR-pistols with stabilizer braces, and issue a rule to “stop the proliferation of ‘ghost guns.'”

Breitbart News reported that Biden planned to put forward executive action on gun controls Thursday, and the fact sheet provides an outline detailing what those actions may entail.

According to the White House:

The Justice Department, within 60 days, will publish model “red flag” legislation for states.

The Justice Department, within 60 days, will issue a proposed rule to make clear when a device marketed as a stabilizing brace effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act.

The Justice Department, within 30 days, will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of “ghost guns.”

The White House notes that Biden will also have “five federal agencies [make] changes to 26 different programs to direct vital support to community violence intervention programs as quickly as possible.” The White House made clear the agencies are acting where Congress has not: “These changes mean we can start increasing investments in community violence interventions as we wait on Congress to appropriate additional funds.”

The White House explained that the DOJ will also begin “[issuing] an annual report on firearms trafficking.” One of the goals of the report will be to guide “policymakers” in crafting new regulations (and laws) to institute over time.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) pushed to recategorize AR-pistols with stabilizer braces in late 2020 then abandoned the effort amid public outcry.

On December 23, 2020, Breitbart News reported that the ATF withdrew their recategorization guidelines, but Biden’s push to have the DOJ refocus on AR-pistols appears to mean the recategorization push is receiving new life.

The purchase of AR-pistols categorized as “short-barreled rifles” could require being fingerprinted and photographed, as well as undergoing a background check, registering the firearm with the ATF, paying the federal government a $200 tax (on top of the price of the firearm), and waiting nine to ten months for the whole purchasing process to be completed. That is the standard process for other firearms and accessories under the purview of the National Firearms Act.

472,Arizona Gov. Signs Bill Barring Enforcement of Federal Gun Controls,"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) signed legislation Tuesday to bar in-state enforcement of any federal firearm laws which violate the Second Amendment.

On March 31, 2021, Breitbart News reported the legislation, HB 2111, titled “2nd Amendment Firearm Freedom Act,” had been passed by the Arizona House and Senate and was heading to Ducey’s desk.

The Associated Press notes that HB 2111 will “prohibit police and sheriffs from enforcing federal gun laws that violate the 2nd Amendment.”

Ducey signed the legislation Tuesday despite petitions against it from Mike Bloomberg-affiliated Everytown for Gun Safety.

KTAR pointed out that Maricopa County Sheriff Paul Penzone, a Democrat, questioned HB 2111, claiming “it will create confusion or challenges more than benefits or protecting the Second Amendment.”

Penzone called the bill “arbitrary,” adding, “I’m just a little bit confused as to what value it offers.”

473,Biden Nominating Gabby Giffords’ Gun Control Affiliate to Head ATF,"President Joe Biden is expected to nominate Gabby Giffords’ gun control affiliate David Chipman to head the ATF on Thursday.

The Associated Press reported Chipman “has for years worked as a senior policy adviser at Giffords,” a law center relied on by gun control proponents throughout the country.

Biden is expected to nominate Chipman to head the ATF at the same time he will be announcing executive action for gun control.

Breitbart News noted Biden’s executive gun control is expected to center on firearms which Democrats label as “ghost guns.” Such guns are built from partially completed frames and parts kits, requiring the builder to have the components, equipment, and know-how to finish out a firearm.

Biden is expected to use executive action to require background checks for the purchase of “ghost gun” components.

474,Joe Biden to Put Forward Executive Gun Control on Thursday,"Politico indicates that President Joe Biden will be putting forth executive action on gun control tomorrow.

Politico notes that the executive action is expected to center on “ghost guns,” making it mandatory for individuals buying gun kits to undergo a background check as purchasers of manufactured firearms are required to do.

On March 25, 2021, Breitbart News reported that executive gun control was on the table, even as Congress weighed legislative action on guns.

White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said, “I think he sees it as vital to take steps on two tracks because congressional legislation obviously has a more permanent, lasting impact. Executive actions are, of course, an important lever that every president has at their disposal.”

USA Today quoted Psaki saying executive gun control options provide the President with “lots of levers” that can be pulled.

On March 27, 2021, Breitbart News explained gun controllers were frustrated with the pace at which Biden was pursuing gun control.

The New York Times reports that Newtown Action Alliance’s Po Murray expressed frustration with what she sees as President Biden’s “inconsistent” messaging on gun control.

Murray made clear that Newton Action Alliance, a gun control group that formed after a man with a stolen rifle attacked Sandy Hook Elementary, supported Biden’s candidacy and expected a better response for doing so.

She said, “We’re trying to figure out what’s happening here. We pushed for it, we supported him, we expected a better response after the election.”

475,12 Shot Tuesday Night Into Wednesday Morning in Chicago,"Twelve people were shot, two fatally, Tuesday night into Wednesday morning in Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s (D) Chicago.

ABC 7 / Chicago Sun-Times reports that six people were shot and killed Tuesday night between 9 p.m. and midnight. Then six more people “were shot between midnight and about 5 a.m. Wednesday.”

The first of the two fatalities occurred just after 9 p.m. Tuesday, when a 16-year-old boy was shot and killed while “standing in the front yard of a home.” The home was located “in the 3100-block of West Douglas Boulevard,” and the boy suffered multiple gunshot wounds.

The second fatality occurred just before midnight on Tuesday, when a 33-year-old male was shot while “standing on the sidewalk in the 7900-block of South Eberhart Avenue in Chatham.” He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.

The violence comes on the heels of a Monday in which 16 people were shot, two fatally, in the Democrat-controlled Windy City.

On April 6, 2021, CNN pointed to an ongoing crime wave in the US and used Democrat-controlled Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City, to highlight spikes in homicides.

476,Fort Detrick Shooting Suspect ID’d as Fantahun Girma Woldesenbet,"The shooting suspect killed at Maryland’s Fort Detrick on Tuesday has been identified as Fantahun Girma Woldesenbet.

CNN reports Woldesenbet was as a Navy Hospital Corpsman who allegedly shot two sailors at Frederick, Maryland’s, Riverside Tech Park, before driving onto the military installation, where he was killed.

Army Brig. Gen. Michael J. Talley indicated Woldesenbet allegedly stopped briefly at the Fort Detrick gate checkpoint, then took off and drove a half mile into the military installation before being stopped. He then allegedly exited the vehicle, brandished a firearm, and was shot dead by military police.

CNBC quoted U.S. Army Garrison Fort Detrick Commander Col. Dexter Nunnally saying, “Our number one priority is the safety of our people. Our emergency responders are well-trained for these types of situations and the fast response of our military police enabled us to contain this threat quickly.”

One of the two wounded sailors is expected to be released from the hospital today. The second is in critical but stable condition.

Breitbart News reported Maryland has stringent gun controls, many of which are contained in the Firearms Safety Act of 2013. That Act banned “assault weapons” and “high capacity” magazines, and put in a place a fingerprinting/registration requirement for new handgun buyers.

The Baltimore Sun pointed out Maryland has a red flag law that took effect October 1, 2018.

Keep up to date with our latest:

47-year-old liberal television personality Midwin Charles suddenly passed away Tuesday, soon after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccination.

Charles, who had preexisting medical conditions including asthma and a severe peanut allergy, was worried about going into anaphylaxis shock when she went to get the shot.

“I have a death-causing allergy to peanuts and wanted to have my Epi-pen with me when I got vaccinated in case I went into anaphylaxis shock,” she wrote. “Turns out my ‘insurance’ wouldn’t cover it and it’s $387????”

Taking the first shot on March 1st, Charles would have been scheduled to take her second dose days before her untimely death.

Just got vaccinated (qualified because of my asthma) at a FEMA center. Everyone at the site is in uniform. It’s good to see our service men and women! Process was organized, efficient, and everyone is kind and in a good mood.

Ok. A little soreness at vaccine injection site right now. ☹️ — Midwin Charles, Esq. (@MidwinCharles) March 2, 2021

Days later the CNN and MSNBC analyst wrote on Twitter that she had “mild fatigue” after her first jab.

Pfizer. I think I had mild fatigue after the shot as well. — Midwin Charles, Esq. (@MidwinCharles) March 4, 2021

The mainstream media contributor’s Twitter feed is full of posts promoting the COVID vaccine, and despite posting several times a day, her feed suddenly stopped on March 24th as if her account was scrubbed or she was unable to use the app.

She even posted a picture of her mother receiving the vaccine, saying, “This took weeks of convincing.”

One wonders what her mother thinks of the vaccine now…

480,CNN Says Chinese-Style Fonts Are Racist,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

CNN has added another entry to the ever-expanding list of things now deemed to be racist, publishing an article asserting that Chinese-style fonts are offensive because they perpetuate “crude” stereotypes.

Author Anne Quito claimed that “chop suey fonts to communicate “Asianness” in food packaging, posters and ad campaigns” are further evidence of “discrimination and systemic racism.”

Yes, really.

For years, the West has relied on so-called ""chop suey"" fonts to communicate ""Asianness"" in food packaging, posters and ad campaigns. But such fonts perpetuate problematic stereotypes. https://t.co/w85xSXp0iN — CNN (@CNN) April 7, 2021

She made this ludicrous assertion despite admitting that the fonts were immediately adopted by Chinese immigrants who came to the United States to set up businesses.

Apparently, the hundreds of thousands of Chinese business owners across the western world don’t appear to believe the font is racist since they choose to proudly display variations of it on the front of their shops and restaurants.

A scholar of Chinese typography also largely dismissed the claims by pointing out that he didn’t find the fonts offensive and that it was a gross oversimplification to label them racist.

Another respondent feared he could be called racist for using Roman fonts.

As a kid, I used Ancient style fonts on assignments re: Greece, Olympics, Democracy. Family used similar fonts on menus in their Greek themed food business. Kind of feel like I need to request CNN's permission to use it now. I've attached an image of the font I'm talking about. pic.twitter.com/RCqXtTQMRE — Georgios (@georgios197) April 9, 2021

Numerous other Asian respondents said they were not offended by the font.

Over the last couple of months, the establishment media has tried to contrive a fake narrative that “white supremacy” is responsible for a wave of hate crimes against Asian-Americans.

In reality, as we have documented, white people are underrepresented in committing violent crimes against Asians, with almost all of the recent high profile examples of hate crimes targeting Asians being carried out by black men.

481,"Infrastructure Bills Don’t Lead To Recovery, Only Increased Federal Control","The concept of infrastructure stimulus has been hyped for decades as a kind of cure-all for economic decline.

The propaganda runs parallel to the narrative of the “savior” of the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In fact, one cannot examine the presidency of FDR without being bombarded with one-sided worship of infrastructure spending and the “New Deal.”

The New Deal is often credited in left-leaning literature as being the singular cure for the depression, and FDR by extension has been handed messiah status among leftists. The New Deal is supposedly proof that massive socialized federal and central bank interventions through public works programs is an economic ambrosia. So, it’s not surprising that nearly every president since the Great Depression has argued for an unprecedented infrastructure bill when faced with economic collapse. A large portion of the public on both sides of the aisle has been trained to think these programs will save us.

Biden, in particular, has made historic stimulus spending the very first platform of his administration, and consistently cites FDR and Lyndon Johnson as patron saints of his infrastructure bill. If it worked for them, then obviously it will work for him… right?

Actually, the New Deal wasn’t a great deal

In reality, the public works and welfare programs of FDR in particular had very little to do with the ending of the Great Depression. In fact, the New Deal actually made the situation worse.

Roosevelt’s own Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, lamented on May 6th, 1939 after two full terms of FDR’s presidency and stimulus programs that the New Deal was a complete failure. He stated to fellow Democrats during a session of the House Ways and Means Committee that:

“We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. And I have just one interest, and if I am wrong… somebody else can have my job. I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises… I say after eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started… And an enormous debt to boot!”

High unemployment and declining living standards were an epidemic in the U.S. throughout the 1930s and well into World War II. The Census Bureau outlines the dismal state of the financial system and the U.S. consumer throughout this period in its “Historical Statistics of the United States.” By 1939 the stock market had crashed on multiple occasions, car sales imploded by 30%, business closures increased by 50%, and real estate foreclosures were still near record highs. The New Deal had achieved minimal benefits of limited scope, but not much else. For the average American, it was as if nothing had changed in a decade.

That said, for certain major companies and big banks, the gains were incredible. Companies like General Electric, IBM, Proctor and Gamble and JP Morgan saw endless profits during the Great Depression while buying up smaller competitors for pennies on the dollar. Those companies involved in public works programs siphoned government money like a black hole while very little trickled down to American workers. All in all, the Great Depression was a windfall for the corporate elite as wealth was consolidated and centralized into fewer and fewer hands.

So we have to ask, if the New Deal was a failure and did nothing to solve the depression problem, what did solve it? Some historians and journalists suggest the beginning of World War II and increased defense spending saved America. This is incorrect. As noted by Robert Higgs, the U.S. standard of living continued to decline throughout World War II. It was not the beginning of the war that saved America, but “After the war genuine prosperity returned for the first time since 1929.”

How the U.S. led the world out of the war

The U.S. was one of the only industrialized nations on the planet that had been left mostly untouched by the destruction. Because of this, all other nations had to turn to the U.S. for manufacturing during the long rebuilding process. In Europe, this process carried on well into the 1950s. The U.S. had very little competition, so much so that the U.S. dollar’s reserve status increased to the point of complete dominance. If you wanted access to manufactured goods, you had to trade with the U.S., and to trade with the U.S., you had to have a stockpile of U.S. dollars.

What I see today is a change in the flow of global commerce – in the opposite direction from the post war era. Yes, trillions of dollars in stimulus measures have created a short term reversal of the pandemic collapse. In fact, there is much evidence to suggest the economy is overheating. Price inflation is becoming rampant in numerous sectors.

In the meantime, U.S. Treasuries are being dumped by foreign investors and the dollar is in decline. Central banks are now dumping the dollar, decreasing their reserves to the lowest level since 1995.

China is now the world’s largest manufacturing base, leaving very little major industry on U.S. soil. In the background, globalists are calling for a “Great Reset” of the world economy that would centralize monetary policy even further and create the foundation of a cashless society built on a digital reserve currency system.

What’s the massive infrastructure spending really about?

I believe, according to the evidence as well as past failures like the New Deal, that Biden’s infrastructure plans will accelerate the U.S. collapse instead of reversing it. The U.S. GDP might increase, but only because it is calculated to include almost every dime the government prints out of thin air and spends. Production of fiat money is not the same as real production within the economy.

Trillions of dollars in public works programs might create more jobs, but it will also inflate prices as the dollar goes into decline. So, unless wages are adjusted constantly according to price increases, people will have jobs, but still won’t be able to afford a comfortable standard of living. This leads to stagflation, in which prices continue to rise while wages and consumption stagnate.

Another Catch-22 to consider is that if inflation becomes rampant, the Federal Reserve may be compelled (or claim they are compelled) to raise interest rates significantly in a short span of time. This means an immediate slowdown in the flow of overnight loans to major banks, an immediate slowdown in loans to large and small businesses, an immediate crash in credit options for consumers, and an overall crash in consumer spending. You might recognize this as the recipe that created the 1981-1982 recession, the third-worst in the 20th century.

In other words, the choice is stagflation, or deflationary depression.

Finally, I would point out that there may also be an ulterior motive for the deluge of federal dollars into state economies through public works. Currently, Conservative states are increasingly willing to risk the consequences of returning to business as usual, regardless of federal mandates. Resistance is building against pandemic-related restrictions.

Red states are also seeing a far superior financial recovery when compared to blue states. Blue states have sabotaged themselves with lockdowns while red states have remained more open. However, the Biden Administration is hell bent on keeping pandemic restrictions in place nationwide

What if infrastructure spending plans are designed to trap red states into compliance with future covid mandates? What if the goal is to bribe these states with trillions in stimulus, but only if they submit to federal authority? I suspect that Biden’s public works bill is partially intended to be a blue state bailout, and money will be withheld from any conservative state that refuses to conform to lockdowns.

Only time will tell what the true agenda is, but this much is undeniable given the facts at hand: Biden’s plan is either an act of desperation, a deliberate attempt to pull the rug out from under the U.S. dollar and the economy to jump-start the globalist reset, or a scheme to lock state governments into obedience over pandemic restrictions.

Whatever else Biden’s “New New Deal” is, it is certainly NOT a plan for economic recovery.

482,"There’s No Way US Could Enforce Global Minimum Corporate Tax on Rest of the World, Claims Prof","Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Although Janet Yellen’s plan to impose a global minimum corporate tax rate sounds like a good idea, it’s unlikely that she’ll succeed in getting a uniform law across the planet, says Steve Keen, honorary professor of economics at University College of London.

On 5 April, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen advocated a global minimum corporate tax rate in order to stop multinational corporations from seeking tax havens as President Joe Biden plans to impose a 21 percent minimum tax on US companies’ foreign income, and raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent to fund his bold infrastructure and climate plan.

The treasury secretary revealed that US administration officials are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax plan. Yellen’s remarks come ahead of the semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank set for this week.

“There’s good reason to impose uniform taxes around the world to stop companies doing tax evasion, which throws the burden of taxation on the working class and the middle class. So that’s in its own right. That is to be applauded,” says Steve Keen, honorary professor of economics at University College of London and author of “Debunking Economics.”

If implemented, the plan could help address the system in which the wealthy “basically evade tax and leave it to the lower classes to pay for the state,” he suggests.

“So something like this, which stopped corporations also using tax advantages to go offshore, maybe bring some corporations back onshore because it makes more sense to be as close as you can to a larger market that might well help boost America’s competitiveness with the rest of the world,” Keen presumes.

Obviously, the global minimum tax idea will be opposed by multinational corporations, according to the professor: “They’ll be outraged to begin with,” he says. “But they’ve always been champions of creative accounting.”

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen: ""We are working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom."" pic.twitter.com/6KhMYSnkcR — The Hill (@thehill) April 6, 2021

The average corporate rate in the G7 is 24 percent, while nine countries are recently reducing their corporate rate, according to the Tax Foundation. Meanwhile, two European industrialised nations, Ireland and Hungary, are known for their low 12.5 percent and 9 percent rates, respectively. The tax group summarises that 100 of the 223 separate jurisdictions surveyed for the year 2020 have corporate tax rates below 25 percent, while 117 have tax rates above 20 percent and at or below 30 percent.

The NPR acknowledges that it’s not clear whether the low-tax countries will embrace a global minimum tax given that Ireland, for example, “has derived a major competitive advantage with a lower tax regimen.”

For its part, Axios suggests that Yellen’s push for imposing a global minimum tax means that the administration sees “the risks to the American economy if it acts alone in raising corporate rates.”

“Competitiveness is about more than how US-headquartered companies fare against other companies in global merger-and-acquisition bids,” she argues. “It’s about making sure that governments have stable tax systems that raise sufficient revenue to invest in essential public goods and respond to crises.”

Still, Keen remains skeptical over the US administration’s ability to convince global governments to adjust their working tax systems to the US needs.

“I don’t think it’s likely to happen at the global level there,” he says. “Americans often think that imposing their rules on the rest of the world is the best thing that can happen to the rest of the world. Most of the time, the rest of the world disagrees. So I think she can try as much as she likes, but there’s no way to enforce something like this.”

The best Yellen can hope for is getting countries to reduce the number of tax havens or to penalise corporations that use them, the professor believes.

483,WaPo: Using the term “cancel culture” is cultural appropriation,"The term “cancel culture” has been slowly but surely acquiring a negative connotation, even among those who in reality promote and execute it. This is evident when individuals or companies canceling somebody are at the same time quick to disassociate themselves from the phrase itself.

The Washington Post appears to be aware of this shift as well, and has now mounted a curious defense of the phrase by accusing conservatives and people who use it to describe something that’s negative “culturally appropriating” the term from African Americans – only to be making it less and less appealing with every passing day.

The problem that people have with cancel culture, though, doesn’t have to do with linguistics or race, but with it resulting in online mobs gathering too often unfairly and without proper reason, in knee-jerk fashion, destroying people’s reputations and livelihoods. Of course this was going to start acquiring negative overtones to more and more people, regardless of their politics or race.

So the Washington Post seems like it’s eager to deflect from the real issue – namely, cancel culture – to dive into semantics instead.

Disregarding the fact that any language, including American English, constantly evolves and will thus naturally incorporate phrases typical of various vernaculars, the article, when it suits its biases, takes issue with this happening with jargon that originates in black communities in the US as “cultural appropriation.” Hence “woke” and “cancel” have been done wrong – while it’s apparently still okay to say “funky” or “uptight.”

Uptight, indeed.

Some might argue that what’s known as cultural appropriation is really cultural integration, and that the opposite would be cultural segregation; not the Washington Post. Its authors believe words like “cancel” as it is used today in online jargon are “weaponized to sneer at the values of many young Black liberals.”

The article also wants to relativize what cancel culture actually means, claiming it isn’t really about firing people up to remove others from the social media public square, or get them fired in real life, but something far more benign that has now acquired a bad name thanks to appropriation and underlying racism.

“Saying someone was ‘canceled’ was more like changing the channel — and telling your friends and followers about it — than demanding that the TV execs take the program off the air,” the Washington Post downplays the phenomenon.",1

The next day, Wentz was visited in Los Angeles by two plainclothes members of the California Highway Patrol, who reportedly accused him of “threatening” Ocasio-Cortez.

Wentz posted a picture of a business card provided by one of the officers, with the caption, “I’m really shaken up right now. I was just visited by two plainclothes police officers from California Highway Patrol at my home. They said they came here on behalf of the Capitol Police and accused me of threatening @AOC on Twitter yesterday. This is provably false.”

The activist added, “I felt scared, intimidated, and violated. They knew my name and where I live. It was done on behalf of a congresswoman who advocates against police state tactics.”

Conservatives warned before the 2020 election that Joe Biden would “pack” the Supreme Court to create a permanent liberal majority.

Now, Biden has taken the first step towards expanding the nation’s highest court.

In the run-up to last November’s election, President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and multiple conservative pundits accused Joe Biden of wanting to “pack” the Supreme Court – a term for expanding its membership and appointing sympathetic justices to achieve a long-term hold over the court’s ideological balance.

Biden never gave a straight answer, telling reporters in October that they would “know my opinion on court-packing when the election is over.”

Now, nearly three months after inauguration, Biden has signaled that court-packing could be on the table. The president issued an executive order on Friday to create a “Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States.”

Made up of a supposedly bipartisan group of legal scholars, judges and activists, the commission will examine the court’s role in upholding the constitution, the lifetime appointment of justices, and, crucially, “the membership and size of the court,” per a White House statement issued earlier on Friday.

To both Democrats and Republicans, the order came as an admission that Biden intends to pack the court. Progressive Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-New York) celebrated, declaring that “to restore our democracy, we must expand the Supreme Court.”

Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee responded differently, warning that Biden “wants to radicalize the Supreme Court.”

Of the Supreme Court’s nine justices, six – three of whom were appointed by Donald Trump – lean conservative. However, some regularly cross ideological lines to side with their liberal colleagues, most notably when the court declined to hear Trump’s cases regarding alleged election fraud last year, and when it ruled against his plan to overturn an Obama-era policy offering a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants brought to the US as children.

The current number of seats on the court was set at nine in 1869, having changed six times before that.

Progressives have long lobbied Biden to ignore conservative outrage and pack the court, and the New York Times noted on Friday that his executive order was made “under pressure from activists.”

However, opposition to court-packing is not limited to conservative circles. In a speech to Harvard Law School students on Tuesday, Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal and, at 82, the court’s oldest justice, warned against opening up more seats.

“Those whose initial instincts may favor important structural changes” should “think long and hard before embodying those changes in law,” he cautioned, according to a Politico report.

490,Daily Mail Exposes Hunter Biden Bombshells After ‘Tell-All’ Book Holds Back,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

With Hunter Biden on a serious image rehabilitation tour – a ‘tell all’ book combined with television interviews from friendly outlets designed to invoke pity over the First Son’s crack and hooker habits, the Daily Mail is now telling the rest of the story regarding the contents of his abandoned laptop after Hunter admitted it ‘certainly’ could be his in a Sunday interview with CBS.

If you’ve seen the laptop photos which leaked last October, you can probably stop here. The Mail did spare us from blurred pictures of Hunter’s wang, along with several sex tapes released by exiled Chinese billionaire Guo Wengui.

After obtaining a copy of the hard drive, DailyMail.com commissioned top cyber forensics experts Maryman & Associates to analyze its data and determine whether the laptop’s contents were real. The firm’s founder, Brad Maryman, is a 29-year FBI veteran Supervisory Special Agent who served as an Information Security Officer and founded its first computer forensics lab. –Daily Mail

The Mail obtained over 100,000 text messages, 154,000 emails and over 2,000 photos which were verified by top forensics experts, which reveal that Joe ‘became a punching bag for Hunter’s drug-fueled rants,’ and ‘paid his grandchildren’s bills when Hunter had drained his bank accounts with prostitutes and crack cocaine.’

Hunter appeared to be obsessed with making and starring in porn films with prostitutes, videos and photos on his laptop show. The hard drive contains hundreds of pictures of naked women and naked selfies of Hunter, as well as dozens of videos. Hunter photographed and filmed himself, often with two prostitutes at a time, in explicit videos that he then posted on adult website Pornhub under the username ‘RHEast’. Hunter filmed himself with the women from his laptop webcam, sometimes shooting at different angles using an iPad and cell phone. –Daily Mail

The Mail also promises to release more Hunter laptop drops:

Hunter’s laptop is a pandora’s box of shocking revelations, explicit photos and intimate communications.In the following days, DailyMail.com will publish more shocking stories from Hunter’s laptop, including:

How Hunter blew hundreds of thousands on prostitutes, drugs and luxury cars, leaving him scrambling to avoid jail for $320k in unpaid taxes

Hunter’s unconventional and unlikely relationship with his well-known psychiatrist

The whispered bedroom conversation with a prostitute caught on Hunter’s webcam, in which he confesses he had a previous laptop stolen – by Russians for blackmail

The president’s son left his 2017 MacBook Pro laptop at a Wilmington, Delaware computer repair shop in April 2019 and never returned for it.

In one text exchange between Joe and Hunter, Joe wrote “Good morning my beautiful son. I miss you and love you. Dad.” To which a petulant Hunter raged at his father for “having made clear to the world that the only reason for not [running for president is your] family problems im glad to be the f***ing bullseye you painted on my back.”

In another exchange, Hunter complained that Joe’s advice not to defend himself publicly during his expensive divorce with ex-wife Kathleen Biden, or his affair with his brother’s widow Hallie, had backfired.

“Your team just made me the uncontrollable troubled tax cheat philanderer sex and drug addict that you tried so hard to fix but couldn’t yt. They just totally wrote my life away,” Hunter wrote, adding “If you dont run [for president] ill never have a chance at redemption.”

Joe replied with a promise to run, though hinted that maybe Hunter should probably stop getting so dramatic over texts due to them being a target.

“I’ll run but I need you,’ he wrote. ‘H[allie] is wrong. Only focus is recovery. Nothing else… When you can and feel like it call. Positive my text etc a target. Love.”

Joe Biden would announce his run for president two months later – during which Hunter’s laptop contents would leak, defeating the purpose of rehabilitating the crack addict’s image.

Joe would again warn Hunter not to spill his life story over text, writing “Be careful what you text. Likely I’m being hacked.”

A woman uploaded a live stream on social media to document severe side effects she experienced from the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine.

In a video posted to Facebook Live, the woman described how she’d “been through hell and back ever since I took that f*ckin’ shot.”

“I got the Johnson & Johnson shot, I got that vaccine Shanette,” she tells a viewer.

“It messed me up bad. I broke out in hives all over my body. And then as I broke out in hives, my whole head started swelling up. Look how big my head is,” the woman says.

“And then, I woke up this morning,” she continues, “and my eye was shut closed.”

The woman says an attempt to seek help from an emergency care provider was futile.

“I went to the urgent care yesterday and they told me they couldn’t give me no medicine because it would interact with the Covid vaccine – which was a lie,” she says, claiming she later received medication during a hospital visit.

The video adds to the body of evidence showing severe adverse reactions following the vaccine, which the establishment promotes as “safe and effective.”

493,Business Owner Fights Back Against COVID Masks & “Vaccines”,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

A small business in Bastrop, Texas is informing its customers about the dangers of COVID vaccines and the lack of protection provided by masks.

Dr. Ed Travis of Travis Chiropractic Center put up signs telling his customers they don’t have to wear a mask to enter days after Governor Greg Abbott rescinded a state-wide mask mandate in early March.

One sign, handed out by the city of Bastrop, read “Masks Required,” and had a red “No” sign crossed over the image of the mask.

On the mask, Travis wrote, “Dumbo’s Feather! A mind control device!”

This is a reference to the Disney cartoon “Dumbo” in which the elephant believes a magical feather gives him the power to fly, only to later realize he could do it without the feather all along.

Essentially, the sign is saying masks give people a false sense of security and that we don’t need them to feel safe.

Another sign on the door reads, “The science says: 35+ research studies prove masks do not stop any virus even SARS-CoV-2!”

The flyer cites alleged CDC data, claiming, “Your chance of dying from COVID-19 = 0.02% – Your chances of dying from the vaccine = 5.0%”

Next, the paper explains how the mRNA shots do not medically or legally qualify as “vaccines.”

“Vaccines by definition are required to have a piece of the virus in them, these do not,” it states. “mRNA alters your DNA to grow spike proteins on your own new cells… Antibodies are made to attack & fight those spike proteins on the virus & your cells! When your immune system antibodies are attacking your own cells that is an AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASE!”

Infowars reached out to Dr. Travis, who said feedback has only been positive thus far and that nobody has been upset by the signs yet.

More business owners in America need to fight back against government tyranny or else we’ll never get our freedoms back.

While one small business fighting back may seem insignificant to some, it only takes a few pioneers to influence millions of Americans to join them.

496,CDC Vows to Tackle Racism Epidemic as ‘Serious Public Health Threat’,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US health authority, has declared racism as a threat to ‘communities of color’ and launched an internet portal to advance the cause of ‘health equity.’

Racism “is a serious public health threat that directly affects the well-being of millions of Americans. As a result, it affects the health of our entire nation,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said on Thursday.

Reflecting on the impact of Covid-19, Walensky said it was “felt most severely, in communities of color” and that the pandemic “illuminated inequities that have existed for generations” to reveal racism as an “epidemic” impacting public health.

The #COVID19 pandemic has illuminated longstanding racial and ethnic health inequities that have persisted in this country for centuries. Learn more about how CDC is working to understand and measure the health impacts of racism. https://t.co/Gtpe22asT3 — CDC (@CDCgov) April 8, 2021

Walensky’s statement defines racism as “not just the discrimination against one group based on the color of their skin or their race or ethnicity, but the structural barriers that impact racial and ethnic groups differently.”

However, the ‘Racism and Health’ portal launched by the CDC defines it as “a system consisting of structures, policies, practices, and norms – that assigns value and determines opportunity based on the way people look or the color of their skin.”

While not perfectly aligned, both definitions define racism as systemic, in line with the critical race theory (CRT) that has informed the Biden administration’s position on “equity” – equality of outcomes that requires treating groups differently – in all things.

The notion that racism was a public health emergency and opposing it was more important than even the Covid-19 lockdowns was first publicly asserted in June 2020, in a letter signed by some 1,200 public health professionals endorsing the Black Lives Matter “racial justice protests” across the US after the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. This now appears to be the official position of the Biden administration.

“To build a healthier America for all, we must confront the systems and policies that have resulted in the generational injustice that has given rise to racial and ethnic health inequities,” the new CDC portal says on its landing page.

In addition to the racism and health portal, Walensky said the CDC will “continue to study the impact of social determinants on health outcomes” and propose solutions, use Covid-19 funding to make “new and expanded investments in racial and ethnic minority communities and other disproportionately affected communities around the country,” and expand internal efforts to “foster greater diversity” and inclusion.

Earlier this week, Vermont announced that it would practice health equity by prioritizing Covid-19 vaccinations for people who identify as “black, indigenous or a person of color (BIPOC).” Last month, the city of Oakland, California launched a guaranteed income project, giving $500 a month to 600 families – but only to those identifying as BIPOC.

The female character has exactly the same eyes and nose as the NPC wojack, a meme that first came to prominence in 2018.

According to KnowYourMeme, the NPC wojack meme, which is named after non-player characters within video games, is supposed to symbolize unthinking drones who just regurgitate whatever the establishment feeds them.

“The character is meant to represent people who do not think for themselves or are incapable of having an internal monologue, bearing many similarities to the terms “basic” and “normie,” according to the website.

Respondents to the CDC tweet immediately noted the similarity to the NPC meme.

500,Long-awaited review reveals journey of water from interstellar clouds to habitable worlds,"Dutch astronomer Ewine van Dishoeck (Leiden University, the Netherlands), together with an international team of colleagues, has written an overview of everything we know about water in interstellar clouds thanks to the Herschel space observatory.

The article, published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, summarizes existing knowledge and provides new information about the origin of water on new, potentially habitable, worlds. The article is expected to serve as a reference work for the next twenty years.

How and where water is formed in interstellar space and how it eventually ends up on a planet like Earth was not well understood 10 years ago. One reason for this is that observations made with ground-based telescopes are affected by water vapor in our own atmosphere.

In 2009, ESA launched the far-infrared space telescope Herschel.

One of Herschel’s main goals was to research water in space. Herschel was in service until 2013. Of particular importance was the HIFI instrument built under Dutch leadership, also known as the ‘molecule hunter.”

In recent years, dozens of scientific articles have been published based on Herschel’s water data. Now these results have been combined and expanded with new insights.

The new study describes the journey of water throughout the star formation process, including the intermediate stages which , until now, had received less attention. The paper shows that most of the water is formed as ice on tiny dust particles in cold and tenuous interstellar clouds. When a cloud collapses into new stars and planets, this water is largely preserved and quickly anchored into pebble-sized dust particles.. In the rotating disc around the young star, these pebbles then form the building blocks for new planets.

Furthermore, the researchers have calculated that most new solar systems are born with enough water to fill several thousand oceans. Ewine van Dishoeck: “It’s fascinating to realize that when you drink a glass of water, most of those molecules were made more than 4.5 billion years ago in the cloud from which our sun and the planets formed.”

Many of the earlier Herschel results focused on the hot water vapor that is prominently seen and copiously produced near forming stars. But that hot water is lost to space by the powerful outflows from the young star. Whilst writing the review, the researchers gained more and more insight into the chemistry of the cold water vapor and ice. For example, they were able to show that interstellar ice grows on dust particles layer by layer. They based this conclusion on the weak signals from heavy water (HDO and D 2 O instead of H 2 O).

In the future, researchers hope to be able to study more water in the universe, particularly in forming planetary systems. However, that might take a while. The next space telescope comparable to Herschel is planned to launch no earlier than 2040. Ewine van Dishoeck: “There was a chance that a ‘water telescope’ would go into space around 2030, but that project was canceled. That is a pity, but it was an extra reason for our team to write the water overview. In that way we have a collective memory for when a new mission comes along.”

Moreover, at the end of 2021, the James Webb space telescope will be launched. It will contain the MIRI instrument, built by European-US partnership, which will be able to reveal a part of the water roadmap that has remained out of reach until now. MIRI will be able to detect warm water vapor in the innermost zones of dust disks. Co-author Michiel Hogerheijde (Leiden University and University of Amsterdam): “Herschel has already shown that planet-forming disks are rich in water ice. With MIRI we can now follow that trail into the regions where Earth-like planets are formed.”

The ALMA telescopes in Chile can observe water vapor in space from the ground. This includes water in distant galaxies where the water lines have shifted away from those in the Earth’s atmosphere. Co-author Lars Kristensen (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) adds: “Thanks to Herschel’s legacy, we can interpret these ALMA data much better.”

“Water in star-forming regions: Physics and chemistry from clouds to disks as probed by Herschel spectroscopy” has been accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics.",1

502,Biden Creates Commission To ‘Explore” Packing The Supreme Court,"Today the White House announced that Biden “will today issue an executive order forming the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States, comprised of a bipartisan group of experts on the Court and the Court reform debate.”

What’s that mean? Joe wants to pack the U.S. Supreme Court. You may remember during the election Biden was asked numerous times about his position on court packing, and he refused to ever answer the question. Looks like we have our answer now.

From the release:

The Commission’s purpose is to provide an analysis of the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform, including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals. The topics it will examine include the genesis of the reform debate; the Court’s role in the Constitutional system; the length of service and turnover of justices on the Court; the membership and size of the Court; and the Court’s case selection, rules, and practices.

Democrats have been calling for packing the U.S. Supreme Court for years. The issue was brought back to the front page when Amy Coney Barrett was nominated and seated in the court last year.

There has been nine Justices of the Supreme Court since 1869, but nowhere in the Constitution does it say how many Justices there should be. If the Democrats were to pack the court and add more Justices, they could easily shift a balance of power in their favor by just appointing as many Justices as it took to agree with them on their issues, effectively ending the check and balance system within our Federal Government.

An old statement from Joe Biden has come back to haunt him. Here’s Biden during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in July 1983.

“President Roosevelt clearly had the right to send to the United States Senate and the United States Congress a proposal to pack the court. It was totally within his right to do that. He violated no law. He was legalistically, absolutely correct,” Biden told the committee. “But it was a bonehead idea. It was a terrible, terrible mistake to make. And it put in question, if for an entire decade, the independence of the most-significant body … in this country, the Supreme Court of the United States of America.”

Today the only White House reporter who asks real questions, Fox’s Peter Doocy, asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki about the old comment:

No President has attempted to pack the court since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1937, when he failed.

503,Clinton Supreme Court justice warns Democrats to leave the high court alone!,"Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, nominated in 1994 by Bill Clinton, has come out today warning Democrats against expanding the seats on the nation’s highest court:

NY POST – Justice Stephen Breyer is warning Democrats against “packing” the Supreme Court as a way to undo the current conservative majority. Breyer, the longest-serving of three Democrat-nominated justices, aired his views shortly before President Biden on Friday announced a 36-member commission to study the issue. Breyer, 82, denounced the idea during a webcast lecture for Harvard Law School on Thursday, saying that it could undermine “the trust that the court has gradually built.” “What I’m trying to do is to make those whose instincts may favor important structure change or other similar institutional changes such as forms of court packing think long and hard before they embody those changes in law,” Breyer said. “I hope and expect that the court will retain its authority… which was hard won. But that authority, like the rule of law, depends on trust. A trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not politics. Structural alteration motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that later perception, further eroding that trust.”

He’s not wrong. If Democrats increase the number of seats to simply erase the so-called conservative majority, then they will have completely and utterly politicized the court and it will lose the trust Americans have in it, which is already on shaky ground to begin with.

And you know who has long agreed with this sentiment? The puppet sitting in the White House right now:

504,Jihad Rep. Ilhan Omar Vocal On Nigerian Police Brutality – Silent On Nigerian Slaves By Jihad,"Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar was very vocal against police brutality in Nigeria in 2020. However, when called upon to join in protests against people made slaves under Islamic jihad in the same country she was nowhere to be found and gave no voice to those oppressed by Islamists.

On Thursday, the Ad Hoc Committee to Free the Slaves of Nigeria protested for an end to modern-day slavery in Nigeria and called on Rep. Ilhan Omar to join them. They even posted a billboard overlooking a downtown intersection near Target Field off freeway 94 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

From the group’s press release:

Washington, D.C. — On Thursday, April 8, at noon, the Ad Hoc Committee to Free the Slaves of Nigeria (CFSN) will protest the enslavement of Nigerians by jihadists. Protesters will gather at a billboard announcing their cause (at 508 North 6th Avenue, Minneapolis) and then at 2:30 will march to the offices of U.S. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (404 3rd Avenue North) to request her help in galvanizing support to emancipate the slaves. The CFSN is an organization of Nigerian and Nigerian American human rights activists and their respective groups.



CFSN member Stephen Enada, president of the International Committee on Nigeria (ICON), said today, “The situation is dire. We can no longer sit in silence as our brothers and sisters in Nigeria are being captured and enslaved.”



Since 2001, Boko Haram terrorists, Fulani militants, and other extremist groups tied to the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, have raided Nigerian villages, killed tens of thousands, and enslaved an untold number of women and children.



In 2021 alone, hundreds of schoolchildren in Nigeria have been kidnapped. Parents fear sending their children to school. School-aged children are terrorized. Most of the individuals captured by Boko Haram jihadists are young women and girls taken by force and trafficked as slave concubines. They endure horrendous abuse and mistreatment. An example of one of these victims is displayed on the billboard: she is 17-year-old Leah Sharibu, kidnapped from her school in Dapchi, Nigeria, in 2018.



“Nigerian women and girls like Leah Sharibu who are enslaved by Boko Haram terrorists for standing courageously for their religious beliefs should never be abandoned or forgotten in captivity,” said CFSN member Dr. Gloria Puldu, president of the LEAH Foundation, an organization that represents the Sharibu family and lobbies for Leah’s release.



“A day must come when we stand up for a secure and peaceful tomorrow — today is that day,” said CFSN member Pastor Ayo Adedoyin of the International Organization for Peace-Building and Social Justice (U.K.).

Nigeria is ranked third in the 2020 Global Terrorism Index (GTI) of countries most impacted by terrorism. Since 2014, Fulani militants — a small, extremist portion of the Fulani people — have accelerated the conflict with Nigerian Christians at an alarming rate. It is reported that Fulani militants are responsible for 7,400 deaths since 2015, targeting and attacking whole communities, schools, and households. Boko Haram has formally pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, and, since 2009, it is believed responsible for murdering approximately 30,000 innocent people and displacing perhaps two million.



“As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and an individual who is outspoken on the importance of standing against the mistreatment of blacks, Representative Omar holds a unique position to promote real change regarding modern-day slavery in Nigeria,” Enada said. “We believe her position as Vice-Chair of the U.S. Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa and Human Rights gives her an audience of real change makers which we at ICON cannot reach on our own. With her help, we could one day see victims of enslavement returned to their desperate families.”



The website, www.FreeNigerianSlaves.org, has been created in order to educate the public. It provides an opportunity for people to sign a petition encouraging Representative Omar to use her voice to help those silently suffering in Nigeria.



To read the full petition and to view the signees go to www.FreeNigerianSlaves.org.

There was no word that Omar showed up, and calls and emails to Omar’s office went unreturned to us.

My guess is because these are her fellow jihadis, she is not going to oppose them because she believes in what they are doing according to the Koran and Hadiths. Remember, this is the same criminal, fraudulent, adulterous woman who supported making sure insurance companies paid the families of Islamic jihadis.

505,Number of Kids Alone at Border Hits All-Time High in March,"The U.S. government picked up nearly 19,000 children traveling alone across the Mexican border in March, authorities said Thursday, the largest monthly number ever recorded and a major test for President Joe Biden as he reverses many of his predecessor’s hardline immigration tactics.

A complex mix of factors in the United States and Central America drove the increase. It has coincided with the Biden administration’s decision to exempt unaccompanied children from pandemic-related powers to immediately expel most people from the country without giving them an opportunity to seek asylum. Children are instead released to “sponsors” in the U.S., usually parents or close relatives, while being allowed to pursue their cases in heavily backlogged immigration courts.

The Border Patrol encountered 18,663 unaccompanied children in March, well above previous highs of 11,475 in May 2019 and 10,620 in June 2014. The agency started publishing the numbers in 2009. Before then, adults made up the vast majority of those crossing the border.

March’s count was roughly double the number of unaccompanied children encountered by the Border Patrol in February and more than five times the number in March 2020.

The huge increase in children traveling alone — some as young as 3 — and families has severely strained border holding facilities, which aren’t allowed to hold people for more than three days but often do. It’s left the government scrambling to find space and hire staff to care for children longer term until they can be placed with sponsors.

{snip}

Amid the growing numbers, more than 4,000 people at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection holding facility have been jammed into a space designed for 250 at a tent complex in Donna, Texas. They lay inches apart on mats on the floor with foil blankets.

CBP must transfer unaccompanied children within 72 hours to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, whose facilities are more suited to longer-term care while arrangements are made to release them. More than 2,000 children were held longer than that at the Donna facility one day last week, with 39 there at least 15 days.

{snip}

Overall, the Border Patrol had 168,195 encounters with migrants on the southern border in March, its busiest month since March 2001, when it counted 170,580 arrests. The numbers aren’t entirely comparable because more than half of last month’s encounters resulted in expulsions under pandemic-related authority instituted by former President Donald Trump and kept in place by Biden.

{snip}

The Border Patrol had 52,904 encounters with people arriving as families, with only about one in three being expelled and the rest allowed to stay in the U.S. to pursue asylum.

506,CDC Director Says Racism Is ‘Serious Public Health Threat’,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday declared racism a “serious public health threat,” becoming the largest federal agency to do so.

“A growing body of research shows that centuries of racism in this country has had a profound and negative impact on communities of color,” CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a statement published on the agency’s website.

Walensky noted the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been felt most severely in communities of color, which have experienced disproportionate case counts and deaths.

“To build a healthier America for all, we must confront the systems and policies that have resulted in the generational injustice that has given rise to racial and ethnic health inequities,” the agency said.

{snip}

According to the American Public Health Association, more than 170 cities, counties and public health agencies in the U.S. have made similar declarations, including the American Medical Association, which praised the CDC’s move.

507,Harvard Doctors Promote Race-Based Discrimination in Boston Hospital in Order to Be ‘Antiracist’,"A Boston hospital released a new “Antiracist Agenda For Medicine” plan that it says will promote “racial equity” in health care.

According to an article published in the Boston Review, the Brigham and Women’s Hospital will offer “preferential care based on race” in order to ensure “race-explicit interventions.”

“Offering preferential care based on race or ethnicity may elicit legal challenges from our system of colorblind law,” Harvard Medical School professors Bram Wispelwey and Michelle Morse wrote in the piece. “But given the ample current evidence that our health, judicial, and other systems already unfairly preference people who are white, we believe — following the ethical framework of Zack and others — that our approach is corrective and therefore mandated. We encourage other institutions to proceed confidently on behalf of equity and racial justice, with backing provided by recent White House executive orders.”

{snip}

In addition to claiming that data showing white people were more likely to be patients at its hospital demonstrates a “racial inequity,” the Harvard professors say “institutional racism” is at the root of America. The piece calls for “implicit bias training” as well as “checklists” for providers to verify they are not being racist to patients.

{snip} “What we need instead, we have come to believe, is a proactively antiracist agenda for medicine.”

{snip}

One of the programs proposed by the writers is something called “Redress.” The program is intended to discriminate against whites who require medical attention so other individuals can automatically be given treatment.

“Redress could take multiple forms, from cash transfers and discounted or free care to taxes on nonprofit hospitals that exclude patients of color and race-explicit protocol changes (such as preferentially admitting patients historically denied access to certain forms of medical care),” the professors write.

{snip}

The hospital will prioritize five neighborhoods in Boston with the highest black and Latino populations and provide outreach in these communities to apologize for supposed institutional racism.

508,"Princeton Offers Admission to 1,498 Students for the Class of 2025","Princeton University has offered admission to 1,498 students for the Class of 2025, including 22% who will be first-generation college students, an increase from 17% last year. Sixty-eight percent of U.S. citizens or permanent residents in the admitted group self-identified as people of color, including biracial and multiracial students. Despite the 15% increase in applications from the previous admission cycle, the University remained committed to a holistic review process.

“We were incredibly impressed by the talent displayed in this year’s record pool. As a result, we had to make extremely difficult decisions in the process of admitting a class that will come to Princeton, form a community and use what they learn to make an impact,” said Dean of Admission Karen Richardson, a Princeton Class of 1993 alumnus. “In what was a very challenging year, these students showed great resilience, and through their applications they showed a real desire to engage with others in the types of discussions that make Princeton such a dynamic environment.”

The University’s undergraduate admission office has mailed letters to students admitted in the regular-decision applicant pool, and applicants will be able to see their decisions via secure online access starting today at 7 p.m. EDT. Close to 100 students were admitted in December 2020 through the QuestBridge National College Match program, which is a binding admission process at Princeton.

The Admission Office suspended its single-choice early action program for fall 2021 entry due to the pandemic and the many disruptions to their high school coursework experienced by students around the world. The early action admission program will be reinstated for next year’s cycle.

For the Class of 2025, Princeton received 37,601 applications through the regular decision program. The applicant pool included students from among 12,298 high schools from 164 countries.

Of the students offered admission, 52% are women and 48% are men. Sixty-four percent of the admitted students come from public schools. Twenty-four percent of admitted students indicated they want to study engineering, and 15% are interested in studying the humanities. Seven percent of admitted students indicated they were undecided. Children of Princeton alumni account for 10% of the admitted students.

The students come from all 50 states, plus Washington, D.C., Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and are citizens of 74 countries. International students represent 14% of the admitted students.

Due to widespread lack of access to testing sites, Princeton did not require applicants to submit standardized test scores this year. This optional testing requirement will extend to the 2021-22 application cycle.

Growing partnerships with college access groups

The Admission Office continues to expand its relationships with college access groups that support lower-income students, first-generation students and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds, including QuestBridge, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America (LEDA) and the Princeton University Preparatory Program (PUPP). During the last year, the Office of Admission hosted approximately 90 virtual programs with community-based organizations around the world. The Office also continues to work closely with EducationUSA, a U.S. Department of State network that supports international students hoping to study at postsecondary institutions in the United States.

Last summer, the Admission Office participated in a virtual college block party program that more than 4,300 FLI (first-generation, lower-income) students and parents attended. The event was hosted by College Greenlight, an access partner that aims to provide traditionally underrepresented students with the information they need to make informed decisions about college. College Greenlight also brings together college counselors and admission professionals to strategize around access initiatives and best practices.

Princeton is a member of the American Talent Initiative (ATI), a national effort to expand college access and opportunity for talented low- and moderate-income students. ATI aims to attract, enroll and graduate an additional 50,000 lower-income students by 2025.

Princeton also recently reinstated a transfer admission program, which particularly encourages applications from students from lower-income backgrounds, community college students and U.S. military veterans. The deadline for transfer applicants was March 1; transfer candidates will receive admission decisions in mid-May. Approximately 12 transfer students are expected to enroll in fall 2021.

509,"EXCLUSIVE: Christian Uyghur Describes Genocide In China, ‘There Is No Hope For Us’","Hundreds of thousands of Chinese Uyghur people in the Xinjiang region are being actively persecuted, oppressed, and sent to concentration camps for “re-education” where they are tortured, abused, indoctrinated, and killed. In an exclusive interview with National File, Chinese Uyghur Mamatili Yakuf tells his story, where he describes a dark, dystopian, authoritarian China.

Yakuf was born and raised in Xinjiang, China by a family of coal miners. He grew up with his mother, father, two sisters and one brother. Yakuf fled Communist China in 2016, after years of mistreatment, abuse, and neglect by his government for being a member of the Uyghur ethnic minority. His friends tell him that it was a “miracle” that he made it out safely, before it was too late, that he would be dead if he hadn’t.

In China, Yakuf grew up Muslim, but converted to Christianity nearly 20 years ago after meeting a Christian Uyghur who became his good friend. After reading the Bible for two years, Yakuf converted and accepted Christ. Yakuf noted that the Chinese government takes a particular disliking to Christian Uyghurs “because we are open minded,” and that the CCP wants “Uyghurs to stay Muslim” because they view it as “a good reason to control them” by calling them terrorists. Yakuf highlighted an ideological divide between the Uyghur Christians and Uyghur Muslims exacerbated by the communists. “For me it’s like two pressures. One is from our people and one is from the government.”

However, his religious conversion made little difference to the CCP. According to Yakuf, all Uyghurs, Christians and Muslims alike, face oppression at the hands of the government. “They don’t care about what religion you have. The government wants to reduce numbers.”

“I went to many big cities in the past,” explained Yakuf. “If you go to any hotel, they check us a lot. They check on why you’re here. They look down on us as a terrorist, any Uyghurs. If you are a good Chinese, good worker, rich or poor, if you go to any place like Shanghai or Beijing, or any city, you go to any hotel, they check because you have [identification] numbers. We have numbers like 65, says you’re from Xinjiang. And it ultimately goes to the police station where they see we are Uyghurs…They see our identity and they say no, because we are Uyghurs,” Yakuf said.

“We understood China very well, you know. So, there is no hope for us. There is no hope,” said Yakuf, when asked why he decided to flee his home country and seek a better life in the United States.“When I came to America, I could see that this is human. They, as a people, are living as a human. But in China, no. That’s different. You’re living in a cage…like animals.”

He explained that the Chinese government utilizes a type of quota system used for filling the Uyghur concentration camps, and that the governor is involved to ensure the capacity numbers are satisfactory in the eyes of the CCP. Chen Quanguo is currently the Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region and has built up a reputation for his draconian measures overseeing the ongoing human rights abuses in the region.

The Chinese government asserts that their crackdown on the Uighur population provides “vocational education and training” for individuals in an effort to combat poverty and Islamic terrorism, but they have been widely condemned for placing hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs in facilities that resemble concentration camps, where horrible atrocities have been reported.

“Testimony in a new BBC report add new and shocking details as to the extent of the torture human beings suffered in the camps. A particularly grisly claim is that Chinese Communist guards use electric batons to rape women, electrocuting them from the inside. One of the survivors interviewed by the BBC, Tursunay Ziawudun, said she endured nine months in a Xinjiang concentration camp and was subjected to torture and gang-rape on almost a daily basis.”

When asked if COVID-19 had any impact on the Chinese government treatment of the Uyghur population, Yakuf saids things have only gotten worse. He explained that the government is using the virus to experiment on Uyghurs and reduce the population under the guise of the pandemic. “COVID-19 is good for the Chinese government to test people and create medicine. I think they use Uyghurs as animals. Also, this is a good time for the government to reduce numbers. They can kill thousands and thousands of people and say to the world, this is COVID,” said Yakuf.

Yakuf believes the virus was scientifically engineered in a lab by the Chinese government. “We say that COVID-19 is a virus that came from a lab. We can say that we understand trusting the Chinese government. They created the virus from a lab because they have many ways to walk. They burnt themselves first, then this fire goes to others, then the virus is gone. If at first you get this virus, then you give it to other countries. If a million people died in China, that’s nothing. They don’t care about their people.”

“We say the CPP is a liar. That’s the only thing I can say. The truth doesn’t come from the CCP. They are liars,” said Yakuf, who expressed great frustration with his government’s decision to oppress his people, who had lived in China long before the rise of communism.

When discussing the international community, governments, and corporations who have strong partnerships with China, Yakuf said “They have two things. One thing is money, the second is girls. They give you money, if you’re not interested in money, they give you girls. Beautiful girls, you cannot say no.” He went on to describe a system rife with strategic corruption, blackmail, extortion, and bribery. “China’s government has more money. Richest government in the world,” explained Yakuf.

Joe Biden recently said he won’t speak out against the Uyghur genocide, citing China’s “cultural norms,” as National File reported. But when we asked Mr. Yakuf about the US government’s past and current approach to Communist China, Yakuf noted that he appreciated the actions taken by President Donald Trump, and remains hopeful that the Biden administration will “care more about Uyghurs” going forward.

“I love Trump because Trump was against China. He was very, very serious against them so we love Trump in this way. Because even Trump doesn’t like immigration, and that’s okay for us, but he understood China very well I think. So he’s against China, Trump understood better than anyone else I think. Biden, our President is good, working better, but I don’t know what’s next. But then I hope that Biden will care more about Uyghurs and immigration in the United States because our status is asylum pending. So we don’t have proof yet, so we cannot speak out,” said Yakuf.

Mamatili Yakuf’s remarkable story will continue to be covered by National File.",1
510,"Hoax uncovered: Black college student allegedly admits responsibility for racist, anti-Semitic graffiti","ALBION, MI – According to Albion police, a 21-year-old black college student has admitted to creating racist and anti-Semitic graffiti that was found on campus at Michigan’s Albion College over the weekend of April 3 and 4, 2021.

The graffiti included racial epithets and references to the KKK.

Some of the scrawled statements read:

“Die N*****s Please,”

“Albion is racist we do exist KKK,” and

“KKK White Power.”

There was also a Star of David with “666” across it.

Racist Graffiti at Albion College Was Written By Black Student, Police Say https://t.co/JqfEot4kWK — Mediaite (@Mediaite) April 9, 2021

Students and faculty members responded to the graffiti by boycotting classes during the following days.

Protests were also held, with students and faculty marching across campus, shouting, “Silence is violence!”

According to WWMT News, students also demanded “change” from Albion’s administrative officials, with some seniors saying “there had been a racial incident just about every semester and little changed over their four years to make campus feel more inclusive.”

Others reported that during the last month there were “least three incidents of racial and derogatory slurs written on walls in the residence halls, along with drawings of swastikas.”

Senior Jayson Sawyer, who organized the boycotts, told WWMT:

“We do this (boycott) because Albion College has polices that take a stance at anti-racism and if they are not upholding those policies, we would like to make sure they are held accountable.”

Some students have indicated that they have not felt welcome on the Albion campus.

Albion student Akaiia Ridley told WWMT:

“We feel like they brought us here to meet a quota more than they did because they wanted us here.”

Ridley added that some changes had been made at the college, “but more needed to be done.”

In response to concerns over the graffiti, Albion College administrators tweeted messages of support to black students and promised to get to the bottom of the situation.

Officials stated:

“We stand together with our Black students, alumni, faculty, staff, and broader community members in condemning the recent acts of racism on campus.

“Hatred and injustice have no place at Albion, and will not be tolerated.”

Albion College President Mathew Johnson also said in a statement to WWMT:

“The racist and anti-Semitic actions taken on our campus over the last week are cowardly and will not be tolerated.”

He added:

“In addition to caring for and protecting the students most directly impacted, and addressing the safety concerns of the broader student body, we are currently investigating who is responsible for racist graffiti on our campus.”

The college also offered a $1000 reward for information on the person responsible, and promised to seek criminal charges. In addition, officials promised to consider expelling or suspending that person if they were found to be a student.

As it turns out, authorities did not have to look far for the alleged perpetrator.

On April 6, police brought in a 21-year-old black Albion College student for questioning. The student reportedly “admitted to creating most of the graffiti.”

Furthermore, video evidence gathered by Albion’s Campus Safety Department confirmed the student’s statements, according to Albion Police Chief Scott Kipp.

The student was released after questioning, and potential prosecution awaits completion of the investigation.

In addition, Albion College removed the student from campus and placed him on a “temporary suspension.” The college is conducting its own investigation “as part of the student judicial process.”

After the student was brought in for questioning, Albion College announced via multiple tweets that he had been identified and acknowledged sole responsibility for the racial and anti-Semitic graffiti.

They have been immediately removed from campus and placed on temporary suspension while we conduct a full investigation as part of our student judicial process. (2/5) — Albion College (@albioncollege) April 7, 2021

Interestingly, the college did not mention the race of the student allegedly responsible.

Albion did, however, assure forthcoming action against racism, saying:

“But we know the acts of racism that have occurred this week are not about one particular person or one particular incident.

“We know that there is a significant history of racial pain and trauma on campus and we are taking action to repair our community.”

Basketball team forfeits game due to multiple player suspensions for kneeling during National Anthem

BLUEFIELD, VA– Back in the middle of February, a NAIA school in Virginia forfeited its men’s basketball game after suspending players for kneeling during the national anthem for several games in January and February.

Bluefield College basketball to remain in locker room for national anthem after being suspended for kneeling

School president Dr. David Olive suspended the entire team for kneeling before their Tuesday home game, forcing them to forfeit Thursday’s game pic.twitter.com/1m3nEbrJ3X — Richard Castagner (@RichardRcccabo) February 14, 2021

According to reports, in a statement after the forfeit, Bluefield College president David Olive said that after players had knelt before multiple games in January and February, even after he told them to stop, he decided to suspend all athletes involved.

The suspensions resulted in a forfeit of the NAIA Appalachian Athletic Conference game against Reinhardt. Olive said in his statement:

“The basis for my decision stemmed from my own awareness of how kneeling is perceived by some in our country and I did not think a number of our alumni, friends, and donors of the College would view the act of kneeling during the anthem in a positive way.”

Reportedly, Olive said became aware on February 1st that players had knelt during a January 30th home game against Bryan College as well as during away games on January 23rd and January 26th.

After he became aware of this, he told head coach Richard Morgan that kneeling during the national anthem “would not be allowed going forward.”

Members of the Bluefield College basketball team were suspended by the school president before a game. The move came when he learned the players had been kneeling for the anthem after being specifically told not to.https://t.co/SBb1C0qS20 — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) February 14, 2021

Olive said he later learned that players continued to kneel at a February 2nd game and the team was kept in the locker room during the national anthem at an away game on February 4th.

Olive then said he reached out on February 5th regarding the kneeling and suggested alternative forms of protest such as staying in the locker room. After the team knelt during a home game on February 9th, Olive said:

“There would be consequences for the actions of the players for violating the College policy.”

According to Bluefield football player Jewels Gray, who is close with many members of the basketball team, this stands in direct contrast with what the basketball team was told before the season began.

Gray discussed the suspensions with the players and said that the players said they were told they were not allowed to released a statement of their own or speak to the media. Gray said:

“Why would our school contradict what they said? We had meetings before the season with the athletic director and the president and they stated that we can kneel and they’d support and be behind us, 100 percent.”

A Bluefield College spokesman denied Gray’s statement and said neither Olive nor Tonia Walker ever offered approval for student-athletes to kneel during the anthem.

Reportedly, Olive reached out to Morgan and the team to discuss the protests, saying that he understood their message and supported calls for racial justice, but that he did not condone doing so during the national anthem.

In a statement, he said:

“I further told them that their intended message in bringing awareness of racial injustices was being diluted or completely lost because some saw their act of kneeling as being disrespectful to the flag, our country, and to our veterans.

In my opinion, their message was not being heard.”

Olive said players told him they had no intention of being disrespectful and shared personal stories of racism they had faced. In response, Olive said the campus leadership team was actively working on a forum to discuss racial inequality.

He said:

“It does without saying that this has been a challenging process for all parties involved. I have hard and I understand the perspective of our players as to why they desire to kneel during the national anthem.

I also know this form of protest immediately shuts down a number of individuals from listening to the intended message because of their perspective regarding the flag.”

He added:

“No individual’s sincere motives are inherently wrong, but I continue to contend that we will not get to where we want and need to get as a country in addressing these racial issues without making honest attempts at creating pathways that bring people together for a common cause.”

In response to his statement, the students inquired about their First Amendment rights being violated, but he informed the players that those rights did not apply to this situation.

Athletes from the men’s and women’s basketball team, football team, and women’s soccer team all joined a video conference discussion arguing that their First Amendment rights had been violated and discussed ways to address the school’s policy. In response, Olive said:

“We are a private entity, not a governmental entity.

We have policies and guidelines throughout the student handbook and the academic catalog that limit certain rights you otherwise might have elsewhere, such as in your home or in a public venue.”

He added:

“The most important to me as it pertains to this matter, however, is what I shared earlier.

When someone puts on a uniform or is performing a function on behalf of Bluefield College, that person is now representing Bluefield College. Heightened expectations are now placed on that individual as to what s/he can and cannot do or say as a representative of the College.”

Players have since decided to stay in the locker room during the national anthem for the rest of the season rather than risk additional forfeitures. Forward Stanley Christian said in a statement:

“It’s bigger than us and we don’t want to have the season taken away from us.

We feel like we’re in a great position to bring this school a title. So, we’ll stay in the locker room during the national anthem. They don’t want any more backlash and we would definitely take a knee during the anthem.”

511,DA Won’t Prosecute Georgia Lawmaker Who Disrupted Voter Bill Signing,"Atlanta, GA – The Fulton County prosecutor announced she would not prosecute the Democratic lawmaker who tried to disrupt Georgia Governor Brian Kemp’s signing of a controversial new voter law in March.

“After reviewing all of the evidence, I have decided to close this matter,” Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis told WSB in an email. “It will not be presented to a grand jury for consideration of indictment, and it is now closed.”

“While some of Representative Cannon’s colleagues and the police officers involved may have found her behavior annoying, such sentiment does not justify a presentment to a grand jury of the allegations in the arrest warrants or any other felony charges,” Willis added.

Kemp signed Georgia Senate Bill 202 into law on March 25 in a ceremony with press and supporters in attendance, WXIA reported.

Opponents of the legislation have complained that it is an attempt to suppress minority votes.

SB 202 requires an ID number, such as a driver’s license, to apply for an absentee ballot, WXIA reported.

The legislation also so cuts off absentee ballot applications 11 days prior to the election, limits the number of absentee ballot drop boxes, and allows the state to take control of what it calls “underperforming” local election systems.

The law also prohibits volunteers from handing out drinks and snacks to voters waiting to vote, WXIA reported.

Kemp defended the legislation and urged people to “not listen to the rhetoric out there.”

“This bill gives the people more opportunities to vote,” the governor said. “It’s not disenfranchising anyone.”

But one Democratic state lawmaker said that seeing Kemp signing the voter bill while surrounded by white male legislators under a portrait of a historic Georgian slave plantation was too much for her so she took action, NBC News reported.

Video captured the moment that State Representative Park Cannon showed up at the door of the governor’s ceremonial office in the Georgia capitol and began pounding on the door to interrupt Kemp, WXIA reported.

George State Patrol were on duty at the door and intervened.

Officers told Cannon to stop banging on the door because of the press conference happening inside and warned her that if she didn’t stop, she would be arrested for obstruction, WXIA reported.

She continued to pound on the door and so officers took her into custody.

The video showed that Cannon was uncooperative, although she stopped short of forcibly resisting arrest.

She locked her legs and refused to walk, so officers on both sides of her were forced to alternately lift and push the lawmaker along to take her out of the state house, the video showed.

“I am not afraid to admit that I was afraid of what might happen,” Cannon told reporters at a press conference on April 1, according to WXIA.

She was booked into the Union City Jail, an overflow detention facility for the Fulton County Jail.

The Georgia State Patrol said the lawmaker was charged with obstruction of law enforcement and preventing or disrupting General Assembly sessions or other meetings, felony charges that carried a sentence of up to eight years in prison, WXIA reported.

But the district attorney intervened on Cannon’s behalf, ABC News reported.

Gerald Griggs, attorney for the legislator, celebrated Willis’ decision not to take the allegations against Cannon before a grand jury, WSB reported.

“I think it was the right decision,” Griggs said. “We provided facts and evidences, witnesses, and video to the district attorney showing our position in this case. The facts and evidence we believe are with us and we are satisfied with her decision.”

“Facts and evidence show that Park Cannon committed no crime and should never have been arrested. We are weighing our next legal options,” the attorney said.

512,"As Americans struggle to make ends meet, New York to allocate up to $15.6K for each unemployed illegal immigrant","ALBANY, NY – A deal has been reportedly reached between New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Democratic lawmakers regarding a $2.1 billion deal that aims to afford unemployed illegal immigrants pandemic-related assistance of up to $15,600 each if they were deemed ineligible for federal financial assistance during the pandemic.

🚨New York will offer a payment of up to $15,600 to illegals who lost work during the pandemic. A $2.1 BILLION fund in the state budget — the biggest of its kind in the U.S. 👉🏻Citizens get $1400, illegals get 11 TIMES THAT AMOUNT! Dems = Citizens Last. https://t.co/RzijVIOrCY — ILovesMyUSA 🇺🇸 (@ILovesMyUSA) April 9, 2021

We at Law Enforcement Today had previously reported earlier in April how there were explorations within the state of New York to afford illegal immigrants some level of benefits or pandemic-related assistance, which reportedly came to fruition on April 6th.

This taxpayer-funded initiative has apparently been coined as the “Excluded Workers Fund”, which champions of the endeavor see this as a sort of rectification for illegal immigrants that didn’t receive such things as stimulus checks or federal unemployment benefits during the pandemic.

Democrat state Senator John Liu referred to the initiative as follows:

“The federal government has given trillions of dollars of relief to Americans, the state of New York is getting billions of dollars, but not everybody. We’re here to fix that. Excluded workers may not have a piece of paper, but they’re New Yorkers just as much.”

Reports indicate that eligible individuals could be receiving up to $15,600 each with respect to this Excluded Workers Fund. The arrival of said figure is based upon a calculation of approximately $300 of assistance per week prorated for the past year of the pandemic.

Apparently, illegal immigrants would have to prove that they were a resident of the state of New York during that period of time and were deemed ineligible for any level of federal unemployment assistance while also illustrating that they had lost income during the pandemic.

Welcome to NY, where people who enter the US illegally can get drivers licenses and now, they can get payments up to $15,000 a person as an “excluded worker”. NY is now the “Coyote State”, where our laws are written to entice people to come here illegally. https://t.co/vOCd9GeQQO — Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) April 7, 2021

Those that don’t fit within the strict confines of the aforementioned can still reportedly be eligible for up to $3,200 each, so long as they can just provide proof of their identity, residency, and some degree of work documentation.

New York State Senate Minority Leader Rob Ortt sees the enactment of the Excluded Workers Fund as being emblematic of Democrats trying to further a “radical agenda” that disregards American while favoring those unlawfully present:

“Democrats are raising taxes and using your federal stimulus dollars to enact a radical agenda rather than helping veterans, small main street businesses, teachers and senior citizens.”

There’s apparently still a lot of schematics being worked out with regard to this initiative, but needless to say it is contentious for not only the immense cost but also the potential beneficiaries of this taxpayer funded effort.

Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant, had even pointed out that this effort is going to require some craftily articulated justification and structuring for it to be somewhat digestible to various critics:

“The question is not, do you help these workers, it is how do you do it and how do you structure it in a way where it is defensible in these districts.”

As mentioned earlier, we at Law Enforcement Today previously reported on some of the efforts preceding the moving-forward of this Excluded Workers Fund.

Here’s that previous report.

_

NEW YORK- The American Rescue Plan. Sold to the American people as a “COVID-19” aid package, hundreds of billions of dollars were directed to bail out states such as California and New York which were substantially in debt.

Now we are finding out how those states, New York in particular, are going to spend that generosity.

According to Breitbart, New York’s handsy Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) is in the midst of negotiating a scheme whereby $2.1 billion will be used to provide taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens and convicted felons.

This after more than a million jobs have been lost in the Empire State and an estimated 80,000 New York businesses have been permanently shuttered.

The New York Post says sources informed them this past week that Cuomo and New York Democrats are in the midst of negotiating a $2.1 billion fund which would provide 187,000 illegal aliens and 87,000 felons with taxpayer-funded unemployment benefits which would mirror benefits provided by state and federal sources.

The proposal, called the “Excluded Worker Fund,” would aim to help residents of New York who were otherwise ineligible for federal aid.

Some advocates of the measure are actually pushing for the funding to be increased by up to 50%…to $3.5 billion.

The proposal, the Post said would impact around 275,00 people total across the state.

The scheme has gotten the attention of state Republicans and not in a good way.

“This outrageous scheme is the latest in a long line of state government’s misplaced priorities. It makes no sense to send billions of taxpayer dollars to illegal immigrants and convicted felons,” said State Sen. Daphne Jordan to the Post.

Advocates for the bill however argue that one proposal coming from Cuomo’s office that people be forced to provide documentation about their work and unemployment history would be difficult. They say that the documentation would be hard to obtain since employers might not be anxious to reveal they had hired illegal aliens.

“We’ve been fighting for far-reaching eligibility,” said State. Sen. Jessica Ramos (D-Queens).

“We want to make sure we are including as many neighbors as possible because too many were excluded from financial relief programs like unemployment insurance,” she said.

Under the plot, illegal aliens and felons would receive up to $28,600 a year, according to analysts. On a weekly basis, they would receive $500. For those unemployed since March 2020, they would receive an average of $12,600 the Post noted quoting a report from the Fiscal Policy Institute.

Not only that, but if the program was included in the state budget, recipients would be eligible to receive medical coverage paid for by New York’s public health insurance program, i.e. New York taxpayers. Thank God for that $2.1 trillion “American Rescue Plan” for coronavirus relief.

The Post also said that dozens of so-called “excluded workers” have been on a hunger strike for 17 days to push for the scheme, which has left supporters angered about the delays.

“Every day that passes without a decision on the budget is another day that puts the safety of workers on hunger strike and the economic security of hundreds of thousands of excluded workers further in jeopardy,” said the Fund Excluded Workers Coalition in a statement.

New York representative and media darling Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said that she supported the “brave workers” who were fasting.

Breitbart notes that illegal aliens are already protected by the state of New York due to the state’s sanctuary policies, while violent felons are already given aid via Cuomo’s bail initiative which allows an overwhelming majority of those arrested out of jail nearly immediately after they are arrested.

Despite the fact the bail reform bill was touted as being only for those accused of “non-violent crimes,” people arrested for crimes such as second-degree manslaughter, aggravated vehicular assault, third-degree assault, promoting an obscene sexual performance by a child, criminally negligent homicide, aggravated vehicular homicide and nearly 100 other crimes have been beneficiaries of the hands-off criminal justice approach pushed by Cuomo and New York Democrats.

Both Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have been among the most dictatorial of all government officials who have become drunk with power since the coronavirus pandemic took hold in March 2020.

Victims of those draconian measure have been historic venues, hotels, restaurants, nightclubs and thousands of other small businesses forced to shut their doors for good.

Among shuttered businesses include the Roosevelt Hotel in Midtown Manhattan East, which opened in 1924, the famed Copacabana which opened in 1940, the Paris Café which opened in 1873 and Empire Coffee & Tea which opened in 1908. That is a mere handful out of the total number of businesses destroyed by Cuomo and de Blasio.

Now, billions of dollars are being directed toward illegal aliens and felons. It just doesn’t seem fair.

513,"California: After shots fired and seven hour standoff, sheriff’s department decides to give up and leave","PETALUMA, CA- On Tuesday, April 7th, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s office announced that a seven-hour standoff that occurred on Easter Sunday in Petaluma ended without any injuries or any arrests.

Misti Wood, a spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Office said that a man who is suspected of armed robbery barricaded himself inside a shed on Casa Grande Road. A hostage negotiations team, which included a psychologist, was unable to convince the man to surrender himself.

According to The Press Democrat, the incident was first reported at 9:20 a.m. Sunday, when a man was reported to have stolen the bike from its owner and then shot out the windows of a residence, afterward remaining on the property on Casa Grande Road between Old Adobe Road and Hidden Valley Drive.

Several households were living on the property in different homes, including trailers, the Sheriff’s Office said.

Law enforcement officials decided to deescalate the scene by leaving, rather than forcing their way into the shed where a man barricaded himself after a report of a bike theft and reckless shooting.​ https://t.co/l1dJDK8P7D — The Press Democrat (@NorthBayNews) April 7, 2021

When officers arrived on scene, the man barricaded himself inside a shed on the property.

In an effort to avoid any civilians being injured, deputies used a loudspeaker to call everyone else on the property out of their residences. There were a total of eight people who resided there, not including the suspect.

Deputies attempted to contact Saldana-Campos through his cellphone, but were unsuccessful. Deputies then called in the hostage negotiations team, as well as Petaluma fire and ambulance resources. Petaluma police and the Sheriff’s Office issued Nixle alerts warning people to avoid the area.

The Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that the hostage negotiations team responds to situations involving suicidal subjects, barricaded suspects and hostage-takers. Their role “is to build a rapport with the involved person and bring the situation to a peaceful resolution,”

A standoff with Sheriff Deputies in Petaluma ends without injuries or even an arrest. https://t.co/yVaJAgTXJE — KSRO (@KSRO) April 7, 2021

Woods stated that Saldana-Campos did not comply with officers attempts to lure him out, and in the hours that followed, deputies began interviewing witnesses to piece together more of what had prompted people to call authorities in the first place.

According to reports, witnesses told deputies that Saldana-Campos had stashed the stolen bike inside his home on the property. One person told deputies that Saldana-Campos had then emerged from his room with a firearm that appeared to be a BB or pellet gun. He fired two shots, though no one was injured.

Due to the fact that authorities were unsure if Saldana-Campos still had the weapon he used earlier, they had to weigh the safest course of action in response to his refusal to surrender, Wood said.

In this case, she said, the team decided on “full complete disengagement by ending the call.”

Wood stated that before leaving, deputies spoke with the other residents of the property about their plan to leave. All but two people said they would stay on the property even with the man still barricaded in the shed.

The two individuals who decided not to stay were able to find temporary housing thanks to the recommendation of deputies.

At approximately 4:29 p.m. on Sunday, April 4th, deputies gave the public the “all clear” signal through Nixle, more than seven hours after the first call.

Law enforcement have had previous interactions with Saldana-Campos, and so they also felt confident that they would be able to locate him and arrest him another time, Wood said.

Wood said:

“We know who he is,”

She went on to say:

“We were evaluating the risk to everybody on-site and that was why we decided to walk away.”

The arrest warrant issued for Saldana-Campos is for allegations including felony robbery and felony threatening of witnesses.

Police K9 Luna murdered by barricaded suspect who had felony warrants for his arrest

March 7, 2021

DULUTH, MN– On February 25th, Duluth Police Department K9 Luna was killed in the line of duty after being shot while trying to apprehend a gunman.

According to reports, the incident began when officers responded to a “physical domestic” incident on the 2300 block of West Fourth Street around 8:30 p.m.

When officers arrived on scene, they discovered the male suspect, who refused to surrender, had felony warrants for his arrest.

Police said K9 Luna was sent in to apprehend the suspect, at which point, the suspect fired gunshots, which hit Luna. Officers returned fire, then set up a perimeter to contain the scene, according to the Duluth Police Department, ABC5 reported.

Police said Luna was taken to an emergency veterinary clinic, but unfortunately did not survive her injuries.

Losing any dog is never easy. Losing a K9 while they are protecting the public and their officers is worse.

Gone too soon. #K9 pic.twitter.com/b6JaNcYh6I — Kate Van Daele (@KateVanDaele) February 26, 2021

No officers were hurt in the incident, police said.

Duluth police department reported on Twitter at the time:

“The suspect continues to be dangerous, armed and uncooperative,”

According to KTTC, the standoff lasted for 20 hours before the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension confirmed the gunman had been found dead inside the home.

The suspect has now been identified as 37-year-old David Joseph Wayne Conwell, the Duluth News Tribune reported.

The Officer Down Memorial Page reported that K9 Luna was a three-year-old Dutch Shepherd who served the DPD for two years.

Her handler was DPD Officer Aaron Haller.

In 2019, Officer Haller told the paper:

“She’s been a great dog,”

He went on to say:

“At home, she’s very capable of turning the switch off. She’s very good with the kids and wife — she’s a lap dog basically. But then at work she’s totally different.”

Sadly, this is not the first K9 that Officer Haller has lost in the line of duty. On January 13, 2019 Officer Haller’s former dog K9 Haas was shot and killed in the line of duty by another barricaded domestic violence suspect.

Robbin Champaigne is the president of the Northland K9 Foundation, an organization that helped raise the funds to get Luna to Duluth, USSA reported.

When speaking about K9 Luna’s death Champaigne said:

“She’s beauty, and snuggles, and smart, and fierce, all at the same time. She was an amazing dog,”

She continued:

“We are all very much grieving.”

Knowing how hard this must be on Officer Haller and his family, Champaigne said:

“He and his family and his department are going through this a second time in just over two years. Again, we just ask for thoughts and prayers, and just rally together to support our police,”

Officers in St. Paul are also sharing the grief. St. Paul Police K9 Unit Commander Paul Ford said:

“It hits home for us, especially because that officer and that K9 came through our K9 school a couple of years ago, so we have that relationship. And we’ve had Duluth officers in our school since then, so it is personal for us,”

Ford continued:

“It’s like losing one of our own family. It’s a good reminder, that, it didn’t happen here, but it can happen anywhere. It can happen to any one of our K9 handlers and their K9 partner as well.”

USSA News reported that there are 18 K9s serving as part of St. Paul’s unit. It’s in part because they’re so versatile. They can track and locate suspects, individuals, evidence and narcotics, oftentimes, quicker than a person can. And the K9s protect their handler just as much as they protect the community.

Ford said:

“They can do a lot of things that will make us safer. But they’re putting themselves at risk, and the community should understand that,”

Our sincerest condolences are with Officer Haller, his family, and the entire DPD.

On February 23rd, we reported on a K9 officer who was in critical condition after being shot three times. Here is that complete story.

514,"BREAKING: NEW YORK PAYING ILLEGALS $15,600! CITIZENS? $0!","BREAKING: NEW YORK PAYING ILLEGALS $15,600! CITIZENS? $0!

The Democrat-controlled New York legislature has passed a budget deal that includes a $2.1 billion fund for illegal immigrants – including a one-time, $15,600 payment for those who lost their job during the pandemic, in a sweeping move which could benefit nearly 300,000 people in the state.

Illegal workers are eligible to receive $15,600 if they can prove they are New York state residents who are ineligible for unemployment benefits due to their immigration status, and lost income due to the pandemic.

Other illegals who are unable to meet the same level of verification will be eligible for $3,200.

New York State likely will offer one-time payments of up to $15,600 to undocumented workers hurt by the pandemic but who couldn’t access federal relief. Nearly 300,000 people may be eligible for the program.

As part of the $212 billion 2022 budget deal reached this week by state lawmakers and the governor, the state plans to allocate $2.1 billion to an Excluded Worker Fund. The budget passed the Democrat-controlled Legislature on Wednesday and now needs to be approved by Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“The $2.1 billion fund to aid excluded workers in this pandemic is urgently needed, thoroughly deserved, and will benefit not only workers and their families but also the communities where they live,” David Dyssegaard Kallick, deputy director of the New York-based Fiscal Policy Institute wrote in a report analyzing the proposal.

The program makes up less than 1% of the budget deal, which also includes $2.4 billion for a rent relief program and a $1 billion aid package for small businesses, arts, entertainment, and restaurants, among other provisions.

New York City would receive the most funding for the program, getting $1.5 billion, followed by Long Island at $251 million and the Lower Hudson Valley at $143 million.

The analysis noted that undocumented immigrants contribute to state revenues by paying sales tax and property taxes through rent, while their employers pay into the unemployment insurance system even though the workers aren’t eligible for benefits.

Additionally, other researchers suggest that between 50% and 75% of unauthorized immigrants pay federal, state, and local taxes as of 2008, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office.

California is the only other state that set up a similar program when it established a $75 million cash assistance program last year that provided undocumented immigrants with a one-time $500 payment.",1
515,Judicial Watch to Supreme Court: Hold Harvard Accountable!,"The Supreme Court Should Hear Challenge to Harvard’s Race-Based Admissions Policies

Maryland Opens ‘Special Clinic’ to Give Latinos COVID-19 Vaccines

Crime Surges as Progressive Policies Gain Ground

The Supreme Court Should Hear Challenge to Harvard’s Race-Based Admissions Policies

The latest Leftist uproar — this over the alleged treatment of Asian Americans — points up their utter hypocrisy on race: accuse Americans broadly of racism while promoting racist policies. For example, it’s a poorly kept secret that academic bastions of leftist ideology have long been discriminating against Asians. Harvard leads the pack.

With our friends at the Allied Educational Foundation (AEF), we filed an amici curiae brief in support of Students for Fair Admission’s petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, challenging the decision of the U.S. District Court for the First Circuit that upholds Harvard College’s race-based affirmative action admissions program. (Students for Fair Admission v. President & Fellows of Harvard College (No. 20-1199)).

Students for Fair Admission argues that Harvard’s admissions program intentionally discriminates against Asian Americans on the basis of race and violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which bans unconstitutional race-based admissions by public universities. Students for Fair Admission also argues that the Supreme Court should overrule the decision in Grutter v. Bollinger, which held that institutions of higher education could use race as a factor in admissions. The petitioners allege that this discriminatory admission’s policy violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause:

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

In our brief, we note that the Equal Protection Clause was designed to stop discrimination:

[O]ne of the core purposes of the Equal Protection Clause is to guarantee that individuals will be free from discrimination based upon race. It should come as no surprise to anyone that legalizing the use of race in deciding who is admitted to schools of higher learning has caused enormous conflict, including among members of this Court.

Our brief rejects the notion discriminating by race in admissions can be justified by “diversity” goals:

College and university administrators might promote greater cross-racial understanding and tolerance in their students, not by racially discriminating against applicants for admission to their schools, but by working to make their schools more tolerant of the expression of different points of view. Admissions programs that intentionally discriminate on the basis of race may themselves be negatively affecting the level of racial understanding and tolerance on today’s college campuses.

We argue that past Supreme Court rulings which failed to enforce the Equal Protection Clause’s prohibition against racial classifications have not stood the test of time. Citing Plessy v. Ferguson, Korematsu v. United States, and Hirabayashi v. United States they state:

Rulings by this Court which held that under the Equal Protection Clause individuals may be treated differently based on race have been wrongfully decided …

In each of these three cases, the Court ruled that treating individuals differently based on a racial classification did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. In each of these cases, the Court found that the government had justified its disparate treatment under the strict scrutiny test. These infamous cases demonstrate how misguided it is for this Court to sanction discriminatory racial classifications.

Additionally, we argue that this case should be heard because the Supreme Court, for decades, has failed to set a clear precedent on the issue of race-based admissions programs for lower courts:

The Bakke line of cases has failed to provide guidance to lower courts and university administrators about what constitutes a permissible race-based admission program. Bakke has led to five rulings over 43 years, in which there are 26 separate opinions. In each, the Court attempts to explain the constitutional rationale for allowing race-based preferences – even though these plainly conflict with the original meaning and text of the Equal Protection Clause.

Court-sanctioned racial discrimination in college admissions is contrary to federal law and the U.S. Constitution. The Supreme Court should stop abusing its powers to protect racial discrimination and uphold the rights of Asian students and other innocents punished for being of the wrong race by Harvard and other universities.

The Allied Educational Foundation is a charitable and educational foundation dedicated to improving the quality of life through education. In furtherance of that goal, the Foundation has engaged in a number of projects, which include educational and health conferences domestically and abroad. AEF has partnered frequently with us to fight government and judicial corruption and to promote a return to ethics and morality in the nation’s public life.

Maryland Opens ‘Special Clinic’ to Give Latinos COVID-19 Vaccines

Too many public health officials put race politics first when it comes to directing the distribution of limited vaccine doses to groups they favor. Our Corruption Chronicles blog has the latest from Maryland.

While many Maryland residents wait patiently to receive their government-funded COVID-19 vaccine, the state’s two biggest counties—both illegal immigrant sanctuaries—have launched a special clinic to inoculate 600 Latinos a week. The exclusive operation will be stationed at the Adventist HealthCare facility in Takoma Park, which is situated in Montgomery County, Maryland’s most populous. The shots will also be offered to Latinos who live in nearby Prince George’s County. Recipients will be “preselected” by an area open borders group, Casa de Maryland, and a Latino Health Initiative launched by Montgomery County two decades ago. In a statement announcing the venture public officials claim that it will help overcome inequities in the vaccine rollout as well as general health disparities that plague poor minority communities.

Judicial Watch is investigating the special Latino clinic, including how the vaccine candidates are chosen and the criteria used by public officials and Casa de Maryland to screen who qualifies. Is it based on a person’s looks, name, or proof of lineage? Judicial Watch has repeatedly tried to contact public officials involved in the project and media representatives for both counties as well as the Adventist HealthCare public relations person listed in the announcement, but calls have gone unanswered. In the name of transparency, Judicial Watch launched Maryland Public Information Act requests for both counties seeking, among other things, the eligibility criteria for individuals who want vaccinations in the special clinic and records identifying the reasons for limiting it to Latinos and excluding other races, ethnicities, or groups. The public records requests also ask both counties for any analyses of whether limiting the vaccination program to Latinos is consistent with state and federal law, including but not limited to the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

Taxpaying Americans have the right to know the details surrounding this exclusionary venture involving a government-funded vaccine intended for all the nation’s residents. The shots were created as part of a Trump administration initiative called Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the development, production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and deliver 300 million doses. The U.S. reportedly invested $18 billion on the project which involves several key government agencies—such as the Department of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—and private companies.

Elected officials in the two Maryland counties offering Latinos priority say it is essential to promoting equitable vaccine distribution. The Vice-Chair of the Prince George’s County Council, Deni Taveras, claims special clinics like the one catering to Latinos are “crucial for helping close the disparity gap.” Montgomery County Council President Tom Hucker asserts that the new inoculation site will help address and overcome “the inequities in our state’s vaccine rollout.” Council Vice President Gabe Albornoz said the Latino project will “help bridge the health inequities imposed by this lethal virus.” The director of the county’s Latino Health Initiative, Sonia Mora, says the public-private vaccination partnership is a bridge for local governments to “overcome inequities and gaps facing the most vulnerable among us.”

Montgomery County launched the Latino Health Initiative, which receives hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars annually, to develop and implement a culturally and linguistically competent health wellness system that values and respects Latino families and communities. The initiative promotes a comprehensive and holistic approach to health and wellness by working with stakeholders throughout the county to enhance programs and services targeting Latinos, develop models and services for Latinos and advocate for policies and practices that effectively reach the county’s Latino communities. Among the county health program’s “partners and collaborators” is Casa de Maryland, a nonprofit that operates day laborer centers for illegal immigrants which are partially funded with public money.

This is hardly the first case involving the discriminatory practice of a local government when it comes to COVID-19 vaccine distribution. In late February Judicial Watch reported that Virginia shifted its vaccine distribution to prioritize black and Latino residents as white 85-year-olds struggled to get the shot. At the time the state was vaccinating the population in phases, with healthcare personnel and residents of long-term care facilities receiving utmost priority. With that population completed, according to the Virginia Department of Health, the second group included a peculiar combination of frontline workers, people 65 and over, those with medical conditions, incarcerated criminals and those living in homeless shelters or migrant labor camps. Then the state shifted to give preference to black and Latino residents 65 and over while much older white seniors, many in their 80s, failed to secure an appointment.

Crime Surges as Progressive Policies Gain Ground

Radical left prosecutors and allied politicians are contributing to dangerous surges in crime in many of our nation’s big cities. In his Investigative Bulletin, Micah Morrison, our chief investigative reporter, exposes how politics is triumphing over public safety and the rule of law:

The early 2021 crime statistics are in and the news is not good. In almost every category, violent crime in urban America is rising.

On Tuesday, New York City’s comprehensive CompStat crime-monitoring system reported a 36 percent jump in March murders from the previous year. Shootings? A 77 percent increase over the previous year.

And it’s not “just” murders and shootings. In late March, drawing on CompStat data, the New York Post raised alarms about “a startling crime surge.” The paper noted a shocking weekly surge in crime data from March 22 to March 28. When compared to the same period last year, in addition to a rise in murders and shootings, rapes were up 125 percent, felony assault up 23 percent, auto theft up 42 percent, robberies up 9 percent.

That looks like the signal of a crime wave.

It’s not just New York. Drawing on local data, CNN recently reported that in Chicago, murders are up 33 percent for 2021, compared to the same period in 2020.

In Los Angeles, according to news reports, 64 people were murdered in the first two months of 2021, an increase of 39 percent over the same period in 2020. Gun violence was up sharply, with 570 reports of shots fired, an 88 percent jump from the previous year.

The troubling news comes as no surprise to Judicial Watch followers. We have repeatedly warned about rising crime in urban America. We’ve also pinpointed a major source of the problem: progressive policy changes.

A “radical criminal-justice reform movement” has succeeded in elections in cities around the country, notes the Manhattan Institute’s Rafael Mangual in the new issue of City Journal. The changes are sweeping: “everything from bail and pretrial discovery to pedestrian stops and ‘restorative’ diversion programs.”

The progressive prosecutor movement—electoral bids “often helped along by funding from left-wing billionaire George Soros,” Mangual notes—has been notching significant successes. “Cities with progressive prosecutors include Chicago (Kim Foxx), San Francisco (Chesa Boudin), Boston (Rachel Rollins), Philadelphia (Larry Krasner), and many others—including New York.”

New York often is a bell weather for change in urban America. That’s the case these days with issues of crime and punishment. And with the retirement of Cyrus Vance Jr., the influential post of Manhattan District Attorney—the second most powerful prosecuting office in the U.S. after the Justice Department—is up for grabs in June.

Manhattan is a Democratic Party stronghold, and the June party primary will essentially decide the Manhattan DA election. The eight Democratic contenders range from center-left moderates to far-left apparatchiks with no prosecutorial experience. There is no front runner.

“In an era of unrest and cries for social justice,” noted Daniel Alonso, a former senior Vance prosecutor writing in the Daily News, the eight candidates all embrace various forms of “progressive prosecutorial agendas — aiming to reduce the focus on incarceration in favor of more lenient alternatives, social services, and greater scrutiny of police officers.”

That’s a big gamble in an era of rising crime. New York—along with much of the rest of urban America—will soon see if the progressive prosecutor movement is a winning bet.

Until next week …

516,Mass Vaccination Event Closed After 11 Suffer Adverse Reactions,"A COVID-19 vaccination site in Denver, Colorado was shut down by public health officials after 11 people suffered adverse reactions to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

They couldn’t even get baby powder right, what makes you think they would make a safe vaccine?

Emergency personnel had to rush two people to the hospital.

“Yesterday, 11 patients at the Dick’s Sporting Goods Community Vaccination Site experienced symptoms like nausea and dizziness after receiving the vaccine and, out of an abundance of caution, EMS transported two of the patients to the hospital for observation,” wrote the Colorado’s Department of Public Health & Environment on Thursday.

Newsmax reports:

The department had previously released a statement that there was “no reason to believe that people who were vaccinated today at Dick’s Sporting Goods Park should be concerned. Adverse reactions are typically immediate.”

Scott Bookman, COVID-19 incident commander with the department, also sought to calm public fears.

“We know it can be alarming to hear about people getting transported to the hospital, and we want to reassure Coloradans that the CDC and public health are closely monitoring all the authorized vaccines continually,” Bookman said.

Dick’s Sporting Goods Park is the home field for the Colorado Rapids professional soccer team in Commerce City, Colorado.

According to The Denver Post, 640 people were turned away but they will be rescheduled to be vaccinated on Sunday. However, they will receive the Pfizer vaccine instead, which according to reports, had been scheduled for Sunday.

Kevin Massey, a spokesperson for Centura Health responsible for delivering the vaccine on Wednesday, said the suspension of the inoculations was merely a precaution.

“We followed our protocols and, in an abundance of caution, made the decision — in partnership with the state — to pause operations for the remainder of the day,” he said.

According to Business Insider, Johnson & Johnson was forced previously to get rid of 15 million doses due to a manufacturing error.

Although Big Pharma likes to lie and tell people that adverse reactions to vaccines are extremely rare, they aren’t. You can actually visit the CDC website and check out VAERS, which is where people report vaccine injury. The only problem is that not everyone reports injuries, and even the ones who do cannot hold pharmaceutical companies liable.

Pretty shady, huh?

517,Director of Warsaw Jewish Museum Calls on Polish Catholic University to Take Action Against ‘Blood Libel’ Priest,"The director of the widely-celebrated, multi-million dollar museum of Jewish life in Warsaw has denounced Poland’s leading Catholic university for failing to discipline a professor who claimed that Polish Jews had historically engaged in ritual murder — one of the deadliest antisemitic falsehoods to have persisted over the centuries.

In an open letter this week to the rector of the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL), Zygmunt Stępiński — director of the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews — charged that Fr. Tadeusz Guz, an ordained Catholic priest who teaches in the university’s philosophy department, had engaged in hateful rhetoric reminiscent of “Nazi or Stalinist propaganda” as well as the notorious antisemitic forgery, “The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.”

During a May 26, 2018 public lecture in Warsaw, Guz falsely alleged that Jews in Poland had engaged in the slaughter of Christian children — the “blood libel” — for ritual purposes.

“We know, dear people, that the facts of ritual murder cannot be erased from history,” Guz told his audience. “Why? Because we, the Polish state, in our archives, in the surviving documents, have had over the centuries — when Jews lived together with our Polish nation — we have legally valid sentences for ritual murders.”

After a complaint was filed by the Polish Council of Christians and Jews, both the Archdiocese of Lublin and the academic authorities at KUL distanced themselves from Guz, but notably refrained from taking further measures against him. “The lecture activities of Fr. Guz outside the university are undertaken and carried out by him on his own responsibility, and the theses he proclaimed are not the position of his superiors,” a joint statement from the two institutions proclaimed at the time.

Earlier this month, however, the KUL’s staff disciplinary committee vindicated Guz once more. In an astonishing statement that effectively endorsed Guz’s claim that there had been “legally valid” prosecutions of Polish Jews for ritual murder, the committee concluded that he had given “his lectures based on the source material, with professional care, and presented his own interpretation of historical facts.”

“Fr. Tadeusz Guz has not committed any act that would breach the duties of an academic teacher or the dignity of the academic teacher profession,” the committee statement continued. “In his lectures outside the campus, he did not offend anyone and did not insult anyone, and thus he did not dishonor his profession.”

In his letter to KUL this week, Stępiński declared: “Let me remind you that in the not-too-distant past, similar statements led directly to social unrest and bloodshed. I must protest publicly and call on the university authorities to take a clear position on this matter.”

Earlier this week, a prominent anti-racist association in Poland urged the European Commission of the EU’s coordinator for combating antisemitism to review European funding of KUL, which currently receives annual support of nearly $25 million.

“Surely, sponsoring an institution which is a nest of virulent antisemitism should be seen as contrary to basic European and human values,” Rafal Pankowski — director of the ‘NEVER AGAIN’ Association — stated in a letter to Katharina Von Schnurbein, the European Commission Coordinator on Combatting Antisemitism.",1
518,SMC Revamp Sidesteps Hill’s Space Acquisition Worries,"WASHINGTON: The Space Force’s long-awaited acquisition command redesign does not address Congress’s central concern with space acquisition, experts say: establishing a single space acquisition authority with a clear chain of command.

“Clearly, this is not what Congress intended,” said one former DoD official. “They wanted one person in charge, and made it the new Assistant Secretary of the Air Force — and even strengthened that position to merge the SAE (legal authority to put things on contract), with a mandate to fix Architecture and Integration.”

Response to the re-organization plans from former DoD officials, acquisition experts and sources close to Congress ranged from confusion to frustration to skepticism. Some, for example, said it doesn’t seem to do much more than change the nameplate on the Space and Missile System Center’s door in Los Angeles.

“It’s not clear that this is streamlining anything,” said Victoria Samson, Washington office director of the respected Secure World Foundation.

Indeed, given that the primary goal of Congress in setting up the Space Force was to fundamentally overhaul how DoD does space acquisition, some lawmakers now may try to force matters in the 2022 defense budget cycle. For example, congressional committees could decide to push up the October 2022 deadline for the Air Force to nominate a new space acquisition czar.

To be fair, a key reason that the proposed redesign does not address the bottom-line question of the space acquisition chain of command is simply that Chief of Space Operations Gen. Jay Raymond does not have the legal or institutional authority to do so.

The Air Force secretary does, say former DoD officials, congressional experts and outside acquisition mavens. But there is no one in that position; John Roth is currently serving as acting secretary. The Biden administration has also not yet nominated an Air Force assistant secretary for acquisition and integration (SAF-AQ); Darlene Costello is the acting.

The Air Force further has yet to establish the civilian position of assistant secretary for space acquisition and integration, clearly mandated in both the 2020 and 2021 versions of the National Defense Authorization Act.

Indeed, as Raymond noted, the Space Force and Air Force have not finished their long-delayed plan, which was due to Congress last March, to craft a new unified space acquisition structure under that new civilian post.

“On the space acquisition report — we did the report. We are still coordinating that through to be able to release it to Congress,” he told reporters yesterday. “We’re going to continue to coordinate that report. But what we’ve also done is we’ve started implementing; we haven’t sat still, we have to move out.”

That report, drafted last May and including a number of proposed reforms to increase flexibility for space acquisitions, was sent to Congress then but was then recalled by the Office of Management and Budget. In a briefing in January, Shawn Barnes, who currently serves as the Air Force’s de facto space acquisition lead, said that while his office has been reorganized, the authority to make those decisions is in the hands of SAF-AQ. And the Air Force civilian leadership has been discussing the issue with congressional staff on an ongoing basis.

A number of experts pointed out this begs the question of why the re-organization — which, as long anticipated, re-designates SMC as a Space Force field command called Space Systems Command — is being announced now. More than one source, in fact, speculated that the move is an attempt by the Space Force uniformed leadership to “bake” something into place before the new space acquisition czar is on board. (Or, in other words, bureaucracy abhors a vacuum.)

However, “people forget that the assistant secretary of the Air Force for space will outrank Gen. Raymond,” said one former DoD official. “So all of this is subject to 100% change.”

The SSC plan, therefore, doesn’t detail the flow of acquisition authorities from the Department of the Air Force through the SAE through the Space Force to the new SSC and its subcomponents with contracting power. Instead, the reorganization establishes a chain of command that runs parallel to that for acquisition — one focused on internal Space Force management of its functions to organize, train and equip, as well as implement requirements developed by operational commanders. So, in that latter capacity, the the three-star SSC commander thus will report to Raymond.

Further, the nominal organization chart shows that the Space Development Agency (SDA) will be brought directly under Raymond by Oct. 1, 2022, per the 2021 NDAA, section 9084.

“The ’21 NDAA had in it provisions for the Space Development Agency to report directly to the CSO beginning 1 October 2022, and that is an organize, train and equip superior, subordinate relationship,” SMC director Lt. Gen. JT Thompson told me during a press briefing on the new command yesterday.

The plan also would create a “limited administrative control, or limited ADCON” link between SSC and SDA, as well as with the Space Rapid Capabilities Office and the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL).

“We also are expanding our partnerships and tightening our relationships with the Space Development Agency and the Space RCO,” Thompson said, as well as AFRL. “We’re trying to tighten those relationships, and so you’ll see a dotted line on the chart — that depicts a concept that we call “limited ADCON. Limited ADCON is: ‘what can we take off your plate, Space Development Agency, AFRL and space RCO, to help you better manage and enable your mission without getting in the way of your unique skills’?”

However, one former DoD official said, the term “limited ADCON” has no official meaning in either the Air Force or the DoD acquisition bureaucratic system.

Almost as confusingly, the org chart doesn’t show a direct “line” of reporting from the SDA director, currently Derek Tournear, to the SAE — something also required in the 2021 NDAA. Instead, an SMC spokesperson explained yesterday that that relationship is signified on the org chart by a small yellow star. This is, again, because the aim of the chart was to explain the organize train and equip chain of command, according to the spokesperson.

As for the “limited ADCON” relationship between SDA and SSC, the spokesperson said that those terms will be sorted out later through a memorandum of understanding between the two separate organizations. In other words, SDA is not becoming part of SSC — a question that has been hotly debated since it first was raised in the 2020 NDAA. So, it these two organizations will still be legally independent space acquisition authorities.

Further, the planned reorganization does not explain what acquisition authorities, if any, the three-star SSC commander will have. Under the current SMC structure, Thompson has acquisition authority over the various program executive officers (PEOs) who directly manage contracting. That SMC structure is referred to by Space Force leaders as SMC 2.0, and was declared fully operational in 2019.

But, as Thompson himself explained in the press conference, under the reorganized SSC, each of the three PEOs — for the Development, Production and Enterprise Corps — will report directly to the SAE not to the SSC commander. This is aimed at pushing “authorities down to the lower levels and empowering decision-makers,” Raymond said.

At the same time, the SSC commander (presumably Thompson himself) will maintain undefined integration responsibilities” as chairman of a new Program Integration Council (PIC).

“One of the things that we did post the SMC 2.0 re-architecture in November of ’19 that I think is important to highlight is that we established the Program Integration Council, which is a collaborative interagency leadership council for cooperation and deconfliction between all of the different organizations that require space assets for our warfighters,” Thompson said. “It ensures that our planning alignment execution and delivery are integrated for the capabilities that we provide.

“It’s made up of a number of different acquisition organizations, including SMC, the NRO, the DAF, for Department of the Air Force, the Rapid Capabilities Office, Space Rapid Capabilities Office, the Missile Defense Agency, and the Space Development Agency,” Thompson went on. “And it also includes a user’s group that’s led by the other United States Space Force field command that’s been stood up, our Space Operations Command, as a user representative to the group.”

But the 2020 NDAA also charged the Air Force to set up a Space Acquisition Council, to be lead by the new Air Force space acquisition czar, that would include most of the same agencies. How that council will relate to the new PIC is anyone’s guess.",1
519,YouTube demonetizes gun review channel Justin Opinion,"Justin Opinion, a YouTube channel that reviews guns and related gear, has been told that it’s no longer eligible to monetize its videos because YouTube has deemed them to be “harmful content.”

The channel has been posting to YouTube since 2012 and during that time, it has racked up more than 23 million total views and gained over 84,000 subscribers.

But after spending almost a decade building an audience on YouTube, the popular video-sharing platform pulled the plug on Justin Opinion’s ability to earn ad revenue from its videos.

“From where I sit, it seems extremely arbitrary,” the channel’s host Justin said. “There was no information given that was of any use to me. I have always tried to comply with policies and to the best of my, of my knowledge, I do comply with their policies of YouTube and, but they say ‘harmful content’ is, is the reason.”

Justin added that because his channel is small, there’s nobody he can talk to at YouTube.

“‘We’ve made this arbitrary and vague ruling that drastically affects you, good luck with that,’” Justin said. “So, that is the, that is the hatred that is, that is the YouTube organization towards its ‘partners.’”

Justin noted that the ad revenue from YouTube videos used to cover between 40-50% of the expenses for his channel but now that’s gone.

“I have recently invested a whole lot of money, a whole lot of money in video-making gear and equipment,” Justin said. “So, it’s ironic that having just spent all this money and learning to play with some of these new tools, comes at a time when YouTube says ‘Oh and by the way, we’re not gonna allow you to make a, a single penny from your videos.’”

When it comes to the future of the channel, Justin said that he will likely have to cut back on video production because the channel has been demonetized:

“It doesn’t mean I’m not going to make any videos but it definitely means I’m not going to make very many videos because as much as I love doing it and as much as I feel like I have to do it, whether there’s any money in it or not, I would be a complete idiot to just spend tons of money producing videos that I can’t get any money back from. I’m not a wealthy person. I don’t have those resources. I don’t have the means to do that.”

Justin added that future content is likely to not require him to purchase anything or “shoot any bullets or things like that” – a transition which he acknowledged will likely be “boring” for viewers and reduced the overall views on the channel.

Justin also said that he now plans to focus more of his efforts on work with other outlets such as Guns America (an online marketplace where Americans buy and sell guns) The Armory Life (a website that provides firearms-focused content).

Justin Opinion is the latest of several gun-related channels to be demonetized by YouTube. The Honest Outlaw and C&Rsenal are some other examples of firearms-focused channels that have been demonetized under YouTube’s vague, far-reaching harmful content rules.

Even news channels that simply document peaceful gun rights rallies have had their content removed for “showing someone holding, handling, or transporting a firearm.”

521,China Leads US In 3 Of 6 AI Areas: Bob Work,"WASHINGTON: The US has a narrow lead on China in artificial intelligence, but the Chinese are catching up fast. In fact, they’re already at least narrowly ahead in three of six critical areas, the vice-chair of the National Security Commission on AI said today.

“We do not believe China is ahead right now in AI” overall, Robert Work said, speaking at a Pentagon press conference alongside Lt. Gen. Mike Groen, the director of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. But, Work went on, “look, AI is not a single technology, it is a bundle of technologies” – what professionals in the field call the “AI stack.”

As Work and the commission’s final report explain it, the AI stack has six interdependent layers. The foundational layer is not technology but people who know what to do with it. The second most fundamental layer is data, the raw material machine learning must ingest en masse to evolve. Then there’s hardware, on which everything else runs; algorithms, the complex and ever-evolving equations that drive machine learning; applications, which apply algorithms to specific functions; and integration, which ties different applications together.

“We looked at each of the six and said, ‘where does the US have an advantage and where does China have an advantage?’” Work explained. “We judged that we’re ahead — slightly ahead or ahead – in three of the six, and China is ahead or slightly ahead in three to six”:

“We believe the US has an advantage in talent right now,” he said. “We definitely are the global magnet for best talent. There’s a lot of things changing in that, and unless we’re smart about our immigration policies, etc. we can lose that, but right now we judge that we have better talent.”

“We know we have an advantage in hardware — the United States and the West more broadly,” he said. However, if China ever took over Taiwan, peacefully or otherwise, the chip factories there would immediately give it the advantage in hardware.

“We think we have an advantage in our algorithms, although the Chinese are really pushing hard,” he said. “We think that they can catch up with us within five to 10 years.”

“Now, they have an advantage in our view, in data,” Work went on. “They have a lot of data, and they don’t have the restrictions on privacy etc. that we do.”

“They have an advantage in applications. They’re very good at that,” he said. In particular, he explained, “China is a little bit ahead of the United States in fielding applications at scale. We can catch up with them, and we believe that JAIC is the logical place in the department to really be the accelerator.”

Finally, “we think they have an advantage in integration, because they have a coherent strategy to get all of the AI stack together to give them a national advantage,” he said. “We have not organized ourselves to win the competition. We do not have a strategy to win the competition. We do not have the resources to implement a strategy, even if we had one.”

Now, not every layer of the stack is equal. China’s advantages are largely in the more visible upper levels of the stack, while America’s are in the more fundamental levels, making their impact less obvious and more long-term.

“Because talent, hardware, and algorithms are so central and important to the stack, we judge the United States, actually, is ahead of China in AI technologies more broadly,” Work said. “But … the Chinese are far more organized for a competition, and have a strategy to win the competition, and are putting in a lot of resources.”

They’re also operating without the ethical constraints that bind the US and its allies, agreed Work and Lt. Gen. Groen. Selling military drones and surveillance software to authoritarian states, for example, are routine for China but deeply controversial in the United States. The willingness to exercise unscrupulous options both gives China an advantage in the competition and makes a Chinese-dominated world a problematic place to live in.

“The Chinese export autonomous systems to nations around the world, in you know, in some places that that have some pretty ugly conflicts that are underway, [with] lots of human suffering and not a lot of world attention in some cases,” Groen said. “So here you are you have a nation that’s proliferating autonomous systems with no ethical baseline, no sets of controls, no transparency.”

“What does that hold for the future… 2025 or 2030?” Groen went on. “We have to be prepared for that.”

“This is as much a values competition as it is a technological competition,” Work said.",1
522,Italian restaurant: Walnut Creek Prima chef-owner taking over Berkeley’s Corso,"As life-shattering as it was to close his Walnut Creek restaurant, Prima, as a result of pandemic-related financial hardship, executive chef-owner Peter Chastain admits that everything happens for a reason. He even said it in a note posted on the door that fateful day in July.

“I believe that when we look back on all of this someday, we will see it as having happened FOR us rather than TO us,” the note read.

Now, Chastain, a native of Berkeley who developed Prima into the pinnacle of Italian fine dining over 21 years, is saving another beloved trattoria that fell victim to the pandemic economy. He has taken over Corso, at 1788 Shattuck Avenue in Berkeley, and plans to re-open it as Via del Corso in June with his team from Prima, including chef de cuisine Massimo Orlando and general manager Marco Penitenti. The eatery will also have a new 20-seat parklet for al fresco seating.

Corso’s owners, Chastain’s long-time friends Wendy Brucker and Roscoe Skipper, are retiring.

“I always loved Corso,” Chastain says. “In many ways, it’s the perfect restaurant, small, super popular, and in my hometown. I’ve come full circle.”

Chastain says that since the announcement was made on Instagram, Corso regulars have been calling with gushing welcomes and pressing questions. Will the steak alla Fiorentina stay on the menu? Can they still get the pollo al Burro, or chicken cooked in butter? What about the chocolate budino? Yes, yes and yes.

“The steaks might be cut a little thicker and our pasta has a bit more egg in it because Massimo is from Emilia-Romagna and we like the texture from that region, but yes we will bring back the favorites,” Chastain says.

Via del Corso is named after the historic main boulevard in central Rome filled with piazzas, churches and foreign embassies. Like Prima, it will feature staples and seasonal dishes from regions throughout Italy, as opposed to focusing on Florentine cuisine, like Corso did.

“We want to be able to do a Brodetto di Pesce (Adriatic-style seafood stew) or a Tuscan wild boar ragu on pappardelle,” Chastain says. “Massimo and I are really sympatico in our values of how we cook. Just the best ingredients stewarded so they can shine.”

Chastain did that with gusto for 21 years, with Orlando cooking beside him for 17 of them. And while co-owner John Rittmaster decided to stay on and keep the adjacent wine shop, Prima Vini, open, there was no way the restaurant could have survived.

“We were just not going to be able to pivot to groceries or delivery in a financially-relevant way,” Chastain recalls. “We had a large staff and even with the PPP money we weren’t able to pay them. And we couldn’t get the landlord to make any concessions, so the more we talked the more we realized we needed to close. It was a really scary decision.”

It was especially scary for Chastain, who has been working in kitchens almost nonstop since the age of 12. A summer of “sitting on the couch watching Netflix and drinking bourbon” finally spurred him into change mode. That’s when he started going on long walks with Brucker, an old friend who was grappling with the tough decision to close her own restaurant.

“They didn’t know what do,” he says. “I’m glad it worked out.”

524,One million signatures needed to help uphold Arkansas law banning abortion,"An organization called The Moral Outcry, operating under The Justice Foundation, has for years aimed to see Roe v. Wade overturned. While that goal is still in progress, the group is now looking to achieve one million signatures on a petition to uphold an Arkansas law that protects nearly every preborn child from abortion in the pro-life state.

According to Allan Parker, president of The Justice Foundation, the Arkansas law is based directly on the Moral Outcry’s petition. Already, the abortion industry is signaling its intent to sue and overturn this pro-life law. “This abortion ban is plainly unconstitutional and we stand ready to challenge it and any effort to block Arkansans from care or dictate their personal medical decisions,” the ACLU of Arkansas said in a statement. “We will be seeing the state of Arkansas in court again.”

Because of this threat and the seemingly inevitable court battle to come, The Moral Outcry and The Justice Foundation are preemptively gathering support, with the goal of one million signatures to be presented to the courts in favor of the law.

“This is a simple way for everyone who opposes abortion to be involved in seeing it stopped. This is not political. It is justice,” read a letter sent to Live Action News from The Moral Outcry. “Under the ‘Law of Judicial Precedent’ co-authored by Justices Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, every signature on The Moral Outcry Petition is ‘severe criticism’ which is a reason for overturning a Supreme Court decision.”

With one million signatures on the petition, pressure can be created on the Supreme Court to uphold the Arkansas law, just as the quarter of a million signatures in Arkansas helped to push for the law to be put into place. The photo of the scroll unfurled into the Arkansas rotunda was placed on the desk of every state senator on the day of the vote, and the bill ultimately passed with over a two-thirds majority in the legislature — showing that the voices of the people matter.

State Sen. Jason Rapert (R), the lead sponsor of the bill, has been open about the intention behind the legislation. Not only will it save lives in Arkansas, but setting up a legal challenge to Roe v. Wade was its direct purpose. With the bill signed into law, legal challenges can bring it to the Supreme Court, opening the door to Roe v. Wade being overturned, which makes signing the petition more important than ever. And there are an estimated 60 days to gather the one million signatures necessary before the court battles begin.

“Because this law has passed, it will be contested by the abortion industry in the District Court, then to the Court of Appeals and ultimately go to the Supreme Court,” Parker said in an e-mailed statement to Live Action News. “We know this is how cases proceed. The battle has begun. We need your help.”

525,What Happened to Biden’s Unity Agenda?,"Less than three months ago, President Joe Biden stood in front of the U.S. Capitol in the wake of the Jan. 6 riots and delivered his inaugural address. He called for unity, and Americans who see a politically fractured country welcomed it.

He could have then put together an agenda that would have accomplished many of his goals while also helping heal the country. On COVID-19, infrastructure and other matters, there was a road to garnering massive bipartisan support. We focus a lot on disagreements, but in each of these areas, average citizens share a broad consensus that Biden could have reached.

Oddly, after dedicating his inauguration to national unity, Biden has abandoned the pursuit entirely.

Biden pushed through a thoroughly partisan COVID-19 bill. The lockdowns smashed the livelihoods of many Americans. There was broad bipartisan consensus to provide further relief to small businesses and individual Americans. There was also support for further funding to speed vaccine deployment. By focusing on these core COVID-19-related areas, Biden could have achieved the first major bipartisan success in many years.

A group of 10 influential Republicans approached him with such a package. Biden rejected them and instead signed the most expensive spending bill in U.S. history, without a single Republican vote. This $1.9 trillion monstrosity delayed relief for average Americans by weeks in order to include non-COVID-19 related pork. It even changed the formula for aid to state and local governments to favor larger blue states over smaller red states.

Furthermore, Biden’s positions on voting and elections are not only partisan but corrosive. Biden, like all Democrats and Republicans, believes that looser voting rules help Democrats. Democrats and their media allies therefore scream about disenfranchisement, racism and voter suppression in the face of even the most reasonable proposals.

This debate has come to a head over Georgia’s new voting laws. Georgia has endured two consecutive election cycles fraught with accusations of foul play. Former Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams still insists her 2018 race was stolen. Former President Donald Trump similarly insists he was robbed. Putting aside the merits of either claim, confidence in our elections is essential.

It is not just reasonable but necessary to take a close look at Georgia’s voting laws — but Biden is not engaging in reasonable debate. He immediately blasted the law as “Jim Crow on steroids.” It’s about as divisive a charge as can be made. Jim Crow laws enforced segregation in schools, restaurants, hospitals and even marriage. They were completely antithetical to the ideals of our country. It’s hard to envision anything as destructive to the cause of national unity as comparing election security to racial segregation.

Biden provided three main arguments. First, he said the new law in Georgia was “sick” and “un-American” because it ended voting at 5 p.m., when working people were just getting off work. But that’s false. Voting in Georgia is open until 7 p.m., and anyone in line by then is entitled to vote. The new law made no changes to that rule.

Biden was so wrong that even The Washington Post’s fact-checkers gave him four “Pinocchios” — their worst score. The Post explained that “the law did make some changes to early voting. But experts say the net effect was to expand the opportunities to vote for most Georgians, not limit them.”

Second, Biden claimed the Georgia law prohibited giving water to people waiting in line to vote. Here, again, the president was not telling the truth; the Georgia law allows polling officials to provide water. What the law prohibits is interested parties giving gifts of any kind (including food or water) to try to influence voters in line. Georgia’s secretary of state justified this restriction based on numerous cases of “line warming.” Examples include a candidate giving out pizza to influence voters in line within restricted voting areas designed to be free from campaigning.

Finally, Biden attacked the Georgia law for requiring photo IDs to vote. Democrats love to claim ID requirements are racist, but the argument is hard to defend. Georgia offers free IDs to any resident. Thirty-five states have some form of ID requirement for voting. Allowing voting without ID significantly increases the chances or perception of fraud. And most importantly, IDs are required for numerous activities in day-to-day life. To assert that black people are somehow incapable of procuring them is belittling and racist.

Biden has every right to oppose the Georgia election law. But the way he has done it is corrosive to the healing he has promised. The president even encouraged Major League Baseball to move their All-Star Game in response to the law. Supporting economic boycotts based on false charges of racism is, of course, the polar opposite of promoting national unity.

Biden’s next signature piece of legislation, infrastructure, should be super popular. Biden could pass a bill to fix bridges and roads, and even provide broadband internet, with massive bipartisan support. Instead, he’s proposing a multitrillion-dollar spending plan filled with partisan, noninfrastructure goals. He’s using the popularity of infrastructure investing to shoehorn a left-wing agenda into the bill.

It’s not clear what changed so drastically for Biden since his inaugural. Reporters say he now envisions himself as the next FDR — changing our country through massive government intervention. In a nation as divided as ours, this sort of aggressive left-wing movement is sure to increase the already gaping political fault lines. It’s also likely to boomerang. People did not vote for change of this nature. Just because it may be possible to squeeze through these changes doesn’t mean it’s smart. The political backlash could be severe.

The saddest part is Biden never even gave a unity agenda a chance. Our country needs the healing he promised. Biden delivers the opposite.

526,’60 Minutes’ Shows Danger of Media Manipulation,"This past Sunday, critically acclaimed CBS program “60 Minutes” broadcast an alleged bombshell report on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and an apparent “pay to play” scheme involving supermarket chain Publix and the state’s distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.

The report alleged that because of a campaign donation Publix made to DeSantis, the governor favored them in the rollout of the vaccine in the state. The program further stated that in doing this, minorities were adversely affected since Publix stores are not as prevalent in their neighborhoods.

The segment included a video of a confrontation between DeSantis and the “60 Minutes” correspondent in which the governor stated that what the correspondent said about Publix was a “fake narrative.” “60 Minutes” decried this as foul play and a deflection.

After the segment aired, video of the full exchange emerged. What it showed was DeSantis explaining the negotiations that occurred between his office and the Democratic-led Palm Beach County over where to distribute vaccines. It was determined that more than 90% of the elderly citizens in the county lived within minutes of a Publix.

As highlighted by Yahoo News and many other news outlets, the “60 Minutes” story was false. It was deceptively edited to make it appear that DeSantis said one thing without showing his complete statement.

After the segment aired and the facts emerged, the Democratic mayor and Democratic health officials in Palm Beach County came out and denounced the “60 Minutes” report as devoid of facts and completely untrue. They stated that in no way was there any foul play in determining to use the Publix supermarkets as vaccine distribution centers and that it was the county’s idea to use Publix, not the governor’s.

Publix likewise stated that it was an attempted attack on their brand for no reason. When “60 Minutes” was asked to respond, CBS deflected, and the spokesperson provided no useful comment.

Dave Kerner, the mayor of Palm Beach County, who happens to be a Democrat, defended DeSantis, stating that “The reporting was not just based on bad information—it was intentionally false. I know this because I offered to provide insight into Palm Beach County’s vaccination efforts and ’60 Minutes’ declined.”

>>> What’s the best way for America to reopen and return to business? The National Coronavirus Recovery Commission, a project of The Heritage Foundation, assembled America’s top thinkers to figure that out. So far, it has made more than 260 recommendations. Learn more here.

This is just the latest example of why a bipartisan majority of the American public does not trust mainstream media. When so-called reputable news segments and organizations deliberately lie and misinform the public for no apparent reason, other than what must be partisan attacks, it only serves to further divide and sow distrust in the media.

In a Jan. 21 article by Felix Salmon published by Axios, he writes, “trust in traditional media has declined to an all-time low.” In fact, according to Axios “56% of Americans agree with the statement that ‘Journalists and reporters are purposely trying to mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations” and “58% think that ‘most news organizations are more concerned with supporting an ideology or political position than with informing the public.”

The scandal surrounding “60 Minutes” highlights exactly why so many Americans are becoming more distrustful of the news media; and with CBS refusing to correct the story, it could be another reason—along with many yet to come—that could further cement that distrust.

“60 Minutes” would have been better served by playing the entire clip and laying out the facts, rather than airing a segment to its millions of viewers on allegations that have no basis in fact.

CBS stated that the clip had been edited “as we always do for clarity”; however, the end result wasn’t clarity, but a blatant attempt to lie and misrepresent what DeSantis said. If other journalists, including those at CBS, don’t call out this type of behavior for what it is, why should anyone trust CBS or any other media outlet?

We have to demand that our journalists are honest and transparent, and purposely deceiving the public only causes more distrust and divisions in a country that’s already deeply divided. “60 Minutes” must do everything it can to correct the story: acknowledging that a mistake was made, correcting it by re-editing the show to include DeSantis’ entire statement, and finally, taking steps to assure this can never happen again.

If they cannot or will not take basic steps, they will, indeed, lose credibility with many Americans. That would truly be unfortunate for one of America’s formerly great news shows.

527,Moving the MLB All-Star Game to Denver Makes Zero Sense,"Major League Baseball is moving its 2021 All-Star Game from Atlanta, Georgia, to Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. This, says ESPN, is “in response to a new Georgia law that has civil rights groups concerned about its potential to restrict voting access for people of color.”

Or, more likely, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred moved the game because he is concerned about Rob Manfred.

Cobb County estimates that losing the game will cost the region more than $100 million. Atlanta, a city with a 51 percent black population — the largest black-majority metro area in the nation — will lose most of all. They’ll live, but it’s certainly a peculiar way for professional baseball to show solidarity with the African American community.

Denver’s black population, on the other hand, is somewhere around 9%. You want to see a segregated city, come visit Denver. That might be something Manfred, who runs a league with one black majority owner, could ponder as his limo drives by the blinding whiteness of neighborhoods like “Stapleton” — officially changed to the anodyne “Central Park” less than a year ago — on his way from Denver International to downtown.

Another funny way of showing your concern for alleged “voting restrictions” is by moving the All-Star Game to a state that in many ways has voting laws at least as stringent as Georgia’s. To vote in Colorado, a person also needs photo identification, just as they do at the will-call window at Coors Field. Like Colorado, Georgia allows voters without ID to use the last four digits of their Social Security number, a bank statement or utility bill, a paycheck, or any other government document with their name and address. Though ID requirements are the provision Democrats hate most, they are broadly popular among voters, which is why they are compelled to use hyperbole and disinformation when talking about the rest of these laws.

Colorado also requires signature verification for mail-in ballots. Over 10,000 voters are rejected every election because of bad signatures. This is the kind of shameful disenfranchisement that Manfred now supports.

You might recall Joe Biden and other Democrats ginning up anger by falsely claiming that parched voters would be denied a mere glass of water under this new law, though the restriction is aimed more at specifically curtailing what campaigns can hand out. It’s hardly unique in the nation.

Colorado, like 37 other states including Delaware and now Georgia, also prevents campaign workers from handing out water or food or paraphernalia to voters near a polling place. Though, to be fair, on this front, perhaps none have as restrictive a policy as New York, the home of Major League Baseball headquarters.

Georgia, like Colorado, also has no-excuse absentee voting. But Georgia’s is more expansive, with a minimum of 17 days of early voting — and a provision allowing counties to request two additional Sunday voting days can bring the total to 19 days. Colorado has 15, which, using the quickly changing standards, basically makes it a state of Bull Connors.

Some will correctly point out that Colorado, which was moving to an all-mail election before COVID-19, automatically mails ballots to every “active” voter — something most states hadn’t even contemplated before last year, and then only on an emergency basis. As a former Colorado resident, I can tell you, it is not uncommon for people to get the ballots of former residents, of grown kids long gone, or of dead relatives in their mailbox. It’s a mess.

Yet, whatever your opinion is on that policy, if failing to automatically provide every resident a mail-in ballot, whether they ask for one or not, is now considered “Jim Crow on steroids,” MLB is going to have an impossible time rationalizing having any event in any state. Or at least, any state that takes its elections seriously.

Now, of course, I don’t accept the notion that preserving some minimal integrity in elections is “suppression.” Apparently, Georgia voters don’t either, as a new Morning Consult poll shows only 36% opposition to the new law. Can you imagine what those polls would look like if most of the media weren’t blatantly lying about the bill 24-7?

But Manfred obviously doesn’t care about the lies. He doesn’t care about the fans. He doesn’t care to know anything about the law. He doesn’t care about the black community. If he did, he wouldn’t have moved the game. Rob Manfred, like so many others who wilt at the first sign of left-wing hysterics, is there to protect himself.

528,Biden Wants to Underfund the Defense Department While Asking It to Do More,"If there is one thing that is quite clear in the early days of the Joe Biden presidency, it is the administration is more than willing to spend taxpayers’ dollars, and their children’s dollars, and their grandkids’… you get the idea. However, when it comes to providing for the common defense, a constitutionally mandated task. the Biden administration suddenly discovered frugality.

Earlier today, the administration released a defense budget for fiscal year 2022 which proposes a meager increase of 1.5%—$705 billion to $715 billion—which is not enough to cover the expected 2.2% inflation in the Pentagon.

Meanwhile, the administration has requested a 16% increase in the non-defense portion of the discretionary budget.

Compare this insufficient resourcing to the administration’s willingness to spend $1.9 trillion on a COVID-19 “relief bill” (that spends 90% on issues unrelated to COVID-19) and a proposed $2.25 trillion “infrastructure” package (but allocates only 5% to roads and bridges).

All of these trillions are on top of the annual federal budget, which is close to $4 trillion every year.

Don’t you worry, the Biden team also has a plan for those trillions, which they released on April 9. It follows the same tax and spend formula from the last two spending packages under the current administration.

These spending sprees add insult to the injury that the Biden administration’s defense budget will cause.

Every year, the Pentagon is faced with a bill for inflationary costs unrelated to its main job of training, equipping, and executing the missions necessary for our national defense—mainly increases in health care costs, personnel salaries, and fuel. Thus, whenever the defense budget does not keep up with inflation—historically around 2%—the department is effectively losing purchasing power and make painful cuts in existing programs and plans.

That was exactly the scenario under the last years of the Obama administration—a budget that did not keep up with inflation, leading to reduced resources for readiness, followed by an entirely predictable readiness crisis.

As The Heritage Foundation’s Index of U.S. Military Strength attests, the military is only now recovering from that readiness crisis. The investments made during the Trump administration have allowed the military to improve its readiness and start re-focusing on great power competition.

However, this is not a task that can be accomplished in the three years following the publication of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which changed the United States’ main defense task from terrorism to great power competition. It is a task that will take time and consistent investment.

America’s top competitor, the Chinese Communist Party, understands the nature of long-term competition. China’s defense budget has consistently increased year after year for at least the last 30 years. They are rapidly ramping up this investment—in just the last five years, the Chinese defense budget has increased by 29%.

Obviously, great power competitions are not simply decided by a nation throwing more money at its military than its adversary. The driving ethos and character of its people—the ideas that form a nation—also play a role. However, maintaining a technologically advanced and relevant military is an extremely important part of deterring both malign activity in the world.

It is foolish and dangerous of the Biden administration to reduce the resources it makes available to the Pentagon while our adversaries are consistently increasing their military’s capabilities and resources. It is also irresponsible of the administration to reduce funding while simultaneously tasking it with more missions.

Thankfully, Congress will have the last say on how the Pentagon is funded and will be able to properly prioritize our national defense and the challenges ahead of our warfighters.

529,"Wicker: Coca-Cola, MLB, and Everyone Spreading Lies About Georgia Voting Law Should Be Ashamed of Themselves","Mark Twain observed that “a lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots.” Today, powerful voices seem determined to prove him right. In recent days, prominent members of the media, government, and big business have spread a wildfire of misinformation about a newly passed voting law in Georgia. Critics have panned the law as “Jim Crow 2.0” and “voter suppression.” President Joe Biden has denounced it as “un-American.”

Corporate executives have piled on as well. The CEOs of Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and Delta have condemned the legislation, and Major League Baseball has decided to punish Georgia by moving this year’s All-Star Game out of Atlanta—a decision MLB’s former commissioner, Fay Vincent, called a “serious mistake.”

If these individuals actually took time to read the bill, they would learn that it makes voting easier in Georgia, not harder. The law expands the window for early voting, allows no-excuse mail-in voting to continue, adds 100 new ballot drop boxes, and allows voters to get a government-issued ID at no charge. It also makes elections more transparent by prohibiting ballot counters from stopping the count in the middle of the night.

The idea that these changes are somehow akin to the oppression of Jim Crow is a complete falsehood designed to inflame divisions in this country. Those who have spread this lie should be ashamed of themselves.

Corporations have historically shied away from controversy to avoid alienating their customers, yet today they seem convinced that bowing to far-left intimidation is good for business. Coca-Cola, for example, was initially silent on the Georgia bill until activists staged a “die-in” at their Atlanta headquarters and liberal sportscaster Keith Olbermann began pushing for a boycott of Georgia products.

Once Coca-Cola fell in line, leaders from more than 100 other companies joined in a moral posturing stampede by releasing a vaguely concerned statement.

This is not the first time corporations have hijacked our political debate. In 2019, Disney, Netflix, and Warner Media threatened to boycott Georgia after state representatives passed a law protecting unborn life. Soon afterward, 180 corporate executives signed an open letter opposing these pro-life protections, calling them “bad for business.”

To their great credit, Gov. Brian Kemp and state lawmakers stood firm and refused to undo these protections, which reflected widely held convictions in Georgia.

Unfortunately, corporate bullying has sometimes succeeded. In 2015, when Indiana passed a religious freedom law on par with 19 other states, corporate backlash was fierce. The NCAA even threatened to move basketball games out of Indiana.

Lawmakers soon caved by passing a “fix” that reversed many of the bill’s protections. A similar case played out in Georgia in 2016, when then-Governor Deal vetoed a religious freedom bill under massive corporate pressure.

It is revealing that the same companies pushing the made-up “voter suppression” narrative are making billions in communist China, a country that is actively committing genocide, persecuting Christians, and does not even pretend to hold elections.

Coca-Cola owns nearly half of China’s soft drink market. Delta recently upped its number of flights to China. Disney theme parks have popped up in Shanghai and Hong Kong. And the NBA—which gladly promotes social justice messages on the court—makes sure that owners and players never criticize the communist state, which is a huge source of profit for the NBA.

Americans see this hypocrisy for what it is: corporate elites who will do and say anything to help their bottom line, regardless of the truth.

530,"Biden’s Appropriations Budget Proposal Is Unreasonable, Irresponsible","After proposing a massive $2 trillion tax-and-spending binge, President Joe Biden released his budget request for fiscal year 2022 discretionary appropriations.

This so-called “skinny budget” proposal would drive up wasteful spending, shortchange actual priorities such as national security, and increase the likelihood of the appropriations bills not being passed through regular order.

The budget is unreasonable and irresponsible, and Congress should instead chart its own course for the fiscal 2022 appropriations process.

For the past decade, the Budget Control Act had established the maximum topline levels for defense and nondefense categories of discretionary spending. However, for fiscal 2022, there are no limits on discretionary spending established in law.

Now that the Budget Control Act has expired, there’s not yet an agreement on what the overall spending level should be. Nevertheless, we do know that this agreement must be reached on a bipartisan basis.

While Biden is attempting to implement most of his partisan agenda through the budget reconciliation process, which can be enacted with just 51 votes in the Senate, discretionary spending does not qualify for reconciliation.

That means the appropriations bills will be subject to the normal 60-vote thresholds to advance in the Senate. Lawmakers from both parties will be required to work together to complete the appropriations process.

Biden’s budget request represents a massive increase in spending from current levels.

In total, Biden proposes $1.5 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2022, a $124 billion increase above the non-emergency amount provided in fiscal 2021. That represents a 9% increase, higher than the increases in prices, wages, population, or the economy.

This unreasonable and irresponsible proposal will not attract the support needed from across the aisle.

Perhaps even more important than the topline spending levels are what the taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars are to be spent on. On that score, Biden’s budget request gets a failing grade.

Agencies known for promulgating job-killing regulations, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Labor, would see substantial increases in spending authority.

The Department of Education would be in line for an increase of more than 40%, on top of the unprecedented federal funding sent to the education establishment over the past year, even as the teachers unions have opposed resuming in-person schooling.

The president even proposes using taxpayer funds to attack Americans’ constitutionally protected rights, by creating new programs to incentivize states to enact gun control laws.

At the same time as these low-priority programs see increases, the president’s budget proposes to shortchange constitutional priorities, such as our national security.

In one positive development, the budget does propose shifting planned spending that had previously been designated Overseas Contingency Operations as a way to fund military requirements and get around spending caps back into the base budget, as has been recommended by The Heritage Foundation.

But this reform is overshadowed by the expansion of the Pentagon’s mission into things like climate change without providing adequate resources for defense needs.

Instead of this irresponsible budget proposal, Congress should follow a very different path for the fiscal 2022 appropriations process.

Congress must exercise spending restraint. The federal government spent $6 trillion in the past year in the name of COVID-19 (even if much of this spending had nothing to do with addressing the pandemic) on top of the already unsustainable budget. And the president has recently released a massive $2 trillion tax-and-spending proposal.

Instead of new spending, it is important for Congress to start implementing a responsible budget.

Lawmakers should carefully review the budget and wind down programs that do not carry out the proper constitutional powers of the federal government and are otherwise unnecessary. At the same time, Congress should ensure that important priorities receive responsible funding levels.

Vital riders, such as the long-standing Hyde Amendment to protect taxpayers from paying for abortions, must be included.

Finally, Congress should not include earmarks in the spending bills. Despite an effort to rebrand them with the euphemism “community project funding,” there is nothing more emblematic of the proverbial Washington “swamp” than earmarks.

Earmarks encourage wasteful spending, spawn corruption, and are not a viable tool for properly exercising Congress’ Article I powers or for ensuring regular-order legislating.

Importantly, the Senate Republican Conference rules ban earmarks. Because the votes of Senate Republicans will be necessary to pass the appropriations bills, those bills should not include earmarks.

Biden’s budget request should be disregarded, and the Congress should chart a responsible path forward to complete the appropriations process.

531,CDC: Racism Is a Serious Public Health Threat,"Racism is a virus like COVID only much worse. By having racist thoughts in the privacy of your own mind, you are causing People of Color to suffer from structural inequity.

Politico:

“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday labeled racism as a serious threat to public health and said it would take steps to address the matter. “What we know is this: racism is a serious public health threat that directly affects the well-being of millions of Americans,” Rochelle Walensky, the CDC director, said in a statement. “As a result, it affects the health of our entire nation.” … According to the American Public Health Association, more than 170 local and state leaders, as well as public health entities, have declared racism a public health crisis or emergency. She added that the pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color because of racism, which she defined as structural barriers that have an impact on the ways different racial and ethnic groups live. …”

COVID systematically targeted and killed People of Color which led to an inequitable outcome in the racial distribution of people who ended up dying from the virus.

CDC:

“The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the death of over 500,000 Americans. Tens of millions have been infected. And across this country people are suffering. Importantly, these painful experiences and the impact of COVID-19 is felt, most severely, in communities of color—communities that have experienced disproportionate case counts and deaths, and where the social impact of the pandemic has been most extreme. Yet, the disparities seen over the past year were not a result of COVID-19. Instead, the pandemic illuminated inequities that have existed for generations and revealed for all of America a known, but often unaddressed, epidemic impacting public health: racism. …”

It is because of nonsense like this. Even when they are telling the truth about something, millions of people will automatically dismiss them because they don’t have any trust in institutions.",1
532,University will no longer describe suspects’ race in public safety advisories to avoid ‘negative stereotypes’,"The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has halted using references to suspects’ race, ethnicity, and national origin in public safety advisories in an effort to avoid “potential negative perpetuation of stereotypes,” according to a report from the Young America’s Foundation.

The shift in policy was put into effect in late January, when it was announced on the Facebook page of the UIC Office of Diversity, and was confirmed this week by a UIC spokesperson.

“Effective January 2021, the university will no longer routinely use race, ethnicity or national origin as a descriptor in public safety advisories,” the University of Illinois at Chicago stated in an email and a public safety advisory.

Sherri McGinnis Gonzalez, senior executive director of Public Affairs at UIC, confirmed the change in policy to YAF.

“The university no longer routinely uses race, ethnicity or national origin as a descriptor in public safety advisories,” Gonzalez said. “This decision was made after consulting with several members of the UIC community, including the UIC Police Department and our recently established Public Safety Board.”

The Public Safety Board, which was formed in August, was established to “review UIC Department policies and procedures especially related to use of force, de-escalation protocols and police training.” The board will also “review of UIC Police Department responses to any major incidents” and “review of UIC Police Department communication practices and policies.”

YAF asked Gonzalez if the new practice of not listing a suspect’s race or ethnicity would affect law enforcement’s ability to apprehend culprits, to which she responded, “It is not expected that this decision will have an impact on UIC Police Department operations and the ability to apprehend perpetrators of criminal acts.”

“The decision is a proactive progressive measure balancing public safety with the potential negative perpetuation of stereotypes,” Gonzalez added. “Our goal is to make everyone feel welcomed and safe on the UIC campus.

“The advisories are designed to inform our community members so they can change their behavior as necessary to be conducive to the recommended safety measures in the UIC campus area,” Gonzalez said, as reported by Fox News. “While we generally will no longer use race or other descriptors, we will include them if, given the totality of the circumstances, they can enhance immediate public safety and/or include differentiating characteristics.”",1
533,Bezos Beats Dem-Backed Union Effort in Alabama,"Amazon workers at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, voted decisively against unionizing, a defeat for high-profile Democrats such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who publicly backed the effort.

The Retail, Wholesale, and Department Store Union, which organized the effort, said it would appeal the vote to the National Labor Relations Board, citing aggressive anti-union efforts by Amazon. But the vote is unlikely to be overturned, as workers voted 1,798 to 738 against unionizing.

“We won’t let Amazon’s lies, deception and illegal activities go unchallenged, which is why we are formally filing charges against all of the egregious and blatantly illegal actions taken by Amazon during the union vote,” said union president Stuart Appelbaum on Friday. While none of Amazon’s 1.3 million workers are unionized, Amazon maintains its pay and health care policies are better than those of its competitors.

In a statement Friday, Sanders said he was “disappointed but not surprised by the vote” and suggested that “some of Amazon’s anti-union efforts may have been in violation of [National Labor Relations Board] law.” Sanders praised Amazon workers in Alabama for “their courage and willingness to stand up for workers’ rights,” calling them “an inspiration to workers all across the country.”

In the lead-up to the vote, Amazon took a surprisingly aggressive line on social media, attacking Sanders for campaigning on behalf of the union. It also assailed Rep. Mark Pocan (D., Wis.) for referring to allegations that Amazon workers were forced to urinate in bottles to save time. Amazon later apologized for its attack on Pocan and tacitly admitted that many Amazon drivers report having to urinate in bottles.

Some Republicans saw the union vote as an opportunity to punish Amazon for its recent censorship of conservative voices. In a USA Today op-ed, Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) called Amazon’s opposition to the unionization effort “inconsistent with the progressive values it has forced on everyone else.” Amazon banned the sale of a bestselling book on the transgender movement last month and adjusted its policies to bar sales of any books that “frame LGBTQ+ identity as a mental illness.”

534,"Joe Biden’s Budget Funds UNFPA, Which Supports China’s Population Control, Forced Abortions","Joe Biden released a proposed budget Friday that would give taxpayers’ money to groups that promote the killing of unborn babies in abortions and have been linked to forced abortions in China.

Among other funding for the abortion industry, Biden’s proposed 2022 budget would restore millions of dollars to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). President Donald Trump’s administration defunded the agency because of its support for China’s oppressive population control measures, which include forced abortions and “illegal” third children.

Susan B. Anthony List president Marjorie Dannenfelser slammed Biden’s plan, saying it would force Americans to support “human rights abuses around the world.”

“From day one, President Biden and his administration have sought to make good on his campaign promises to the abortion lobby,” said SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser. “These assaults on innocent life and the very foundations of our country are deeply unpopular and pro-abortion Democrats pursue them at their own political peril.”

She pointed to a recent Marist poll that found strong public opposition to taxpayer-funded abortions in the U.S. and abroad. According to the poll, 77 percent of Americans oppose using tax dollars to promote abortion overseas, and 58 percent oppose using tax dollars to fund abortions in the United States.

“Under his radical cabinet appointees, funding increases will translate to a payday for abortion giants like Planned Parenthood and [British-based abortion chain] Marie Stopes International, and greater complicity in human rights abuses around the world,” Dannenfelser continued. “We strongly urge our congressional allies to reject any budget that omits these vital protections.”

Please follow LifeNews.com on Gab for the latest pro-life news and info, free from social media censorship.

Starting 2017, the Trump administration cut off funding to UNFPA, because the agency “partners on family planning activities with the Chinese government agency responsible for … coercive policies,” such as forced abortions and forced sterilizations.

“This determination was made based on the fact that China’s family planning policies still involve the use of coercive abortion and involuntary sterilization, and UNFPA partners on family planning activities with the Chinese government agency responsible for these coercive policies,” the state department said at the time.

The Trump administration said it redirected the funds – at least $32.5 million in 2017 alone – to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which provides medical care to families across the world.

UNFPA denies its involvement in forced and coerced abortions and sterilizations in China. In a statement previously, the UN agency said it “promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination.”

Previous pro-life presidents also cut off funding to the UN agency, while pro-abortion presidents, including Barack Obama, restored the funding.

On the campaign trail, Biden promised to restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund. Then, in December, pro-abortion groups that backed his campaign released a list of “first priorities” for his administration, including $111 million for the pro-abortion agency.

Previously, Reggie Littlejohn, president of Women’s Rights Without Frontiers, a human rights group that works to end forced and coerced abortions and sterilizations in China, explained the problems with UNFPA.

“UNFPA has been found to be complicit with coercive population control in China in the past, and I have no doubt that any unbiased investigation would find them complicit again. I have long advocated for the defunding of UNFPA” by the U.S., she said.

Littlejohn said she also would like to see a new investigation of UNFPA’s work in China. She referred to a 2002 investigation by former Secretary of State Colin Powell that found UNFPA was complicit with Chinese officials in coercive methods of family planning.

“I believe that any independent, unbiased investigation into UNFPA’s activities in China will lead to the inescapable conclusion that they are complicit with China’s population control practices, which include forced abortion and involuntary sterilization,” she continued. “To the extent that the global community is funding the UNFPA, the blood of Chinese women and babies is on our hands.”",1

Last week, Major League Baseball announced it would move the All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver in protest of Georgia election-administration legislation that would make the state’s voter access more liberal than the pre-COVID status quo; in the eyes of Democratic activist and former gubernatorial candidate Stacy Abrams—who, presaging the actions of another prominent Georgia election-loser of a different political party, never formally conceded the legitimacy of her defeat to Gov.

536,"Marx, Abstract Labor, and Absurdity","Many readers will be familiar with Robert Paul Wolff’s In Defense of Anarchism, a brilliant criticism of the state’s authority that arrives at conclusions similar to those of Lysander Spooner. Wolff is probably best known for his work on Kant, but he has published penetrating accounts of Marx and Rawls as well. He thinks that Marx offers an analysis of capitalism that is largely correct, and in a recent series of posts on his blog, The Philosopher’s Stone, he offers a characteristically incisive way of looking at Marx’s labor theory of value. I’ll try to show that, however ingenious it is, Wolff’s interpretation does not rescue Marx from absurdity.

Wolff lets us know his high opinion of Marx’s Das Kapital here:

I have devoted extended periods of time to the study and interpretation of the writings of two great thinkers: Immanuel Kant and Karl Marx. To the thought of each I devoted two books and a number of lengthy essays. Kant was my first love and my first great challenge. When I had come to terms with his thought, I was sure I would never encounter another thinker as difficult to master or correctly to interpret. However, when I plunged into Das Kapital three years after publishing my second book on the philosophy of Kant, I found myself confronted with a task even more demanding and multidimensional than that posed by the Critique and the Grundlegung [Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals].

As Wolff explains, Marx took over from Adam Smith and David Ricardo the notion that supply and demand aren’t fundamental in determining the price of commodities, i.e., goods produced in mass quantities and sold on the market. Changes in supply and demand will cause prices to fluctuate to restore equilibrium, but this equilibrium is determined by a “natural price” that underlies supply and demand and acts like a Newtonian gravitational force in drawing market prices to it. This natural price is the cost of labor: commodities will tend in equilibrium to exchange in proportion to the labor time needed to produce them. To the objection that capital goods are also costs of production, Ricardo replies that capital goods can be considered “stored-up” or frozen labor, so it remains true that labor costs determine price. There’s a complication involving rent that I won’t go into here. Rent according to this theory isn’t a cost of production; it is a payment capitalists make out of their profits to landlords.

As Wolff notes, there are severe problems with this theory:

In the simple case to which Marx [ha]s restricted himself in volume 1, commodities according to Ricardo exchange in proportion to the quantities of labor required directly or indirectly for their production, or what came to be called “embodied labor.” But if we think about that for a moment we realize there is a very elementary problem. Suppose that we are talking about the exchange of 10 yards of woolen cloth for a wooden chair. The labor required to produce the woolen cloth is quite different from the labor required to produce the chair. Making the woolen cloth involves shearing sheep, washing and drying wool, carding the wool, spinning it into thread, weaving the thread into cloth, and cutting the cloth into a piece 10 yards long. Making the chair involves sawing wood, turning it on a lathe, sanding it, nailing it or joining it with pegs, and so forth. Clearly if we are to compare the labor that produced the cloth with the labor that produced the chair we must abstract from all of these differences. So at the very least, we must be claiming that the wool and the chair exchange in proportion to the quantities of abstract labor required for their production…. But even this is not enough to capture what is mysterious about Ricardo’s seemingly transparently clear theory. For not all abstract labor counts when we are comparing boots and linen or wool and chairs. Suppose that a chair has been made by an apprentice carpenter who has not yet learned the trade. That young man … might spend 10 hours making a chair that a master carpenter could make in five. The buyers of chairs in the market would laugh at a carpenter who charged a higher price for chair because it had taken his apprentice longer to make. Only such labor as is “socially necessary” at any given stage in technological development counts when calculating the relative price of goods in the marketplace. Indeed, the problem is more complex even than I have suggested. Suppose that the carpenters making the chairs are averagely expert in their woodworking skills but find themselves under the direction of a novice manager who has not yet mastered the technique of combining the labor available to him in an averagely efficient manner. The time spent by the carpenters making the chairs may be devalued not because of any lack of skill on their part but because of problems elsewhere in the firm. Thus, when Ricardo says that in the simple case (remember, we are still in volume 1[of Das Kapital] goods exchange in proportion to the quantities of labor directly and indirectly required for their production, he must be interpreted as actually meaning (although he himself failed to recognize this fact) that goods exchange in the market in proportion to the quantities of abstract socially necessary labor embodied in them.

You might think that this is sufficient to show that Marx is using the wrong theory. Wolff does not think so. He points out that the first few chapters of Das Kapital are written ironically, in a dense and difficult style. Marx is fully aware of the difficulties involved in “abstract labor,” but it is precisely the absurdity of capitalism that it compels capitalists and workers to look at value in this way:

Such talk is, Marx argues, thoroughgoingly mystified but, he insists, we must not commit the error of supposing that it is therefore mistaken. Quite to the contrary…. Marx writes “the categories of bourgeois economy consists of such like forms. They are forms of thought expressing with social validity the conditions and relations of a definite historically determined mode of production, viz., the production of commodities. The whole mystery of commodities, all the magic and necromancy that surrounds the products of labor as long as they take the form of commodities, vanishes therefore, so soon as we come to other forms of production.” What does Marx mean when he says that this absurd form of thought has social validity? His meaning is profound and goes to the heart of his critique of capitalism. The form of thought whose absurdity he has just revealed has social validity both on the side of the capitalist and on the side of the worker. This mode of thought has social validity for the capitalist because only by conforming his thought and action to it can he function in a competitive marketplace and earn the going rate of return on his investment. If he makes the mistake of thinking of these commodities actually as useful objects made by the labor of real men and women and designed to satisfy human needs, he may become distracted by the reality of the factory or workplace and find himself lavishing more labor on a fabric than will be justified in the market by the price he can get for it…. On the side of the workers, the necessity that they stifle their natural desires, instincts, and creative efforts in their labor in order to work steadily, efficiently, and in a fashion that produces an adequate profit for their employers will of course have a severely destructive effect on their human being.

Though this is ingenious, it rests on a mistake. It isn’t the capitalist market that compels capitalists and workers to think absurdly in units of abstract labor. It is the false labor theory of value that does this. Without the assumption of a natural price that explains what is “really” going on beneath the veil of supply and demand, there is no mystification involved in capitalist production. As Murray Rothbard says, “[V]alues always fluctuate, and there is no invariable fixed base of value from which other value changes can be measured.” (Classical Economics, p. 91) In the Austrian theory of subjective value, there is no resort to this wrong assumption. Wolff at one place suggests that the notion of equilibrium price that modern economists use shows that natural price has not been abandoned, but this isn’t correct. The use of equilibrium concepts, such as Mises’s evenly rotating economy, doesn’t introduce anything other than subjective values in determining prices.

Marx, and Wolff following him, has projected the absurdities of the labor theory of value into the capitalist system of production and on that basis declares capitalism absurd. We should bypass this tangle and instead accept the clear analysis that Austrian theory provides. Austrian economics, to anticipate a rejoinder, does not rest on the unrealistic assumptions of neoclassical economics about which Wolff has elsewhere complained. He would no doubt respond that Austrian theory disguises the realities of capitalists’ exploitation of workers, but it is the false labor theory, not capitalism, that generates an “exploitation” that doesn’t exist.",1

539,Government Property Is Sacred. Your Property? Not So Much.,"In light of the government’s response to the January 6 storming of the Capitol, anyone with a sense of political sanity can no longer argue that the war on terror is separate from American domestic affairs.

US imperialism came full circle on January 20, 2021, when Washington, DC, was subject to military occupation during Joe Biden’s inaugural address in order to secure the Capitol from alleged domestic extremist threats. When the right-wing violence that DC talking heads were squawking about never came to pass, their focus shifted toward trying to deradicalize right-leaning individuals who hold heretical views that collide with the managerial regime’s gospel.

Former CIA director John Brennan was among the most vocal of the national security analysts who started listing off all sorts of problematic groups that potentially pose a threat to the dystopian political order crystallizing before our very eyes. The very act of a mob entering the holiest of the holy sites was enough to make the entire American political establishment have a mental breakdown.

The message the ruling class sent to those who protested against it on its own turf was quite clear: tread your muddy boots on our cathedral and you will be met with a firm response from the state.

So far, there have been over 380 people charged for participating in the January 6 incident. Rest assured, the politicians who are still shaken from January 6 are thirsting for more people to persecute. Words like coup, insurrection, riot, sedition, and treason were tossed around liberally to describe the January 6ers’ actions. Only a regime insecure of its legitimacy would throw a hysterical fit over the Capitol storming that looked more like a live-action role-play than a rebellion that threatened the sovereignty of the DC occupational regime.

Pace the gatekeepers of political opinion, launching a coup requires strong organizational capacity. Rag-tag groups of disgruntled, working-class Americans, disenchanted soccer moms, and extremely online Trump supporters aren’t going to be pulling off a coup against the most powerful government in human history. The only venues the January 6 demonstrators were capable of taking over were online chat rooms.

Government Property Is Sacred. Your Property? Not So Much.

The double standards the legacy media is using to rationalize its ongoing crusade against the specter of extremism are farcical, to say the least. Over the course of a year when small business owners had their livelihoods destroyed by arbitrary lockdowns and widespread rioting, the ruling class tipped their glasses to the rioters and scoffed at those who had to put up with last summer’s mayhem. These same media mouthpieces would likely be cheering on color revolutions and lively protests in the Middle East and post-Soviet countries as the maximal expression of democracy. But when a rowdy group of Trump supporters took it upon themselves to stand up to their overlords, that was simply a bridge too far.

Any attempt to try to point out the inconsistency of the media’s hyperventilation with regard to the January 6 incident was met with instant pushback. On Morning Joe, TV host Joe Scarborough did not pull any punches:

I know there are idiots on other cable news channels that will say, “Well, this mom-and-pop store that was vandalized during the summer riots and that’s just as bad as the United States Capitol being vandalized.”

He then had some colorful language for those who hazarded to question the prevailing narrative:

No jackass it’s not. It’s the center of American democracy. No, jackass…. I’m not going to confuse a taco stand with the United States Capitol.

Only a detached member of the ruling class whose livelihood is sustained by some of America’s most powerful corporations can have the gall to downplay the trials and tribulations untold numbers of small business owners had to endure during last summer’s mayhem. Scarborough and his coterie would have us believe that paying respect to the hallowed institutions of mass democracy is the highest virtue while trying to defend the fundamental property rights of the common man is the province of buffoons and country bumpkins.

Private Property Is Critical for Civilization

For the adherents of the present political order, symbols of the state have a religious aura. Private property, on the other hand, is a sacrificial animal to be slaughtered as an offering to the state, though the whole conversation would likely change if the property of Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Mitch McConnell, Big Tech, or politically connected corporations were defiled. The media would instantly become situational capitalists and vigorously defend the sanctity of their fellow peers’ property.

Heck, they might just throw some radical free market defenses here and there. But this is out of pure self-interest, not because political leaders and their corporate patrons hold private property in high esteem at a holistic level. As for the rest of the rubes in Middle America, they must put up with whatever political violence befalls them and their property. Simply raising their voices in opposition will have the legacy media branding them as “reactionary,” “racist,” or “bigoted.”

On the other hand, Ludwig von Mises championed private property not just for the sake of sloganeering but to impart to others the necessity property rights as a means of fostering social harmony. As he observed in Omnipotent Government, “If history could teach us anything, it would be that private property is inextricably linked with civilization.”

Mises’s vision for a social order predicated on respect for property rights has not disappeared from the intellectual consciousness. Successors of the Misesian tradition such as Hans-Hermann Hoppe have continued making the case for the respect of private property as a civilizing force. Unlike the public sector worshippers, Hoppe understood the bigger picture of why private property, not public property, should be treated as sacred. In fact, he views the modern-day state as one of the principal drivers of the erosion of property rights throughout the West.

As Hoppe argued in Democracy, The God That Failed,

the more the state has increased its expenditures on social security and public safety, the more our private property rights have been eroded, the more our property has been expropriated, confiscated, destroyed, or depreciated, and the more we have been deprived of the very foundation of all protection: economic independence, financial strength, and personal wealth.

As a consequence of being accustomed to having mandarins in distant government agencies lord over them, Americans have gradually come to disrespect or at least take for granted the concept of property rights. Hence their relative indifference toward the wanton destruction of the property of many small business owners’ establishments during last summer’s riots and toward the devastation government-promoted lockdowns inflicted on these small business operations.

The sign of a healthy society is one where private property is respected, and not just the private property of social media whales or parasitic defense contractors, but that of everyday business owners. By the same token, a society with a modicum of sanity would laud acts of self-defense against criminals who wish to harm the property and persons of lawful individuals.

Many of the shibboleths that Americans have been so inured to accept are now imploding. Millions of Americans took it upon themselves to buy firearms at record levels during a time when police services could be relied on to uphold their end of the proverbial social contract. Moreover, a number of Americans responded by forming community defense groups to protect their neighborhoods when police were standing down left and right as cities nationwide burned.

Even the idea of privatized policing is starting to gain traction in certain parts of America. Occasionally, moments of crisis force people to rethink many political premises they’ve stubbornly held. There’s something to be said about how operating outside of one’s comfort zone can compel one to look at things differently.

All things considered, the past year should all but dispel the notion that America is “exceptional.” It’s a country with a myriad of problems that have dotted empires in decay throughout world history—a corrupt ruling class, an overstretched military presence, an unstable monetary system, and declining public order.

Reassuring ourselves of empty bromides that it “can’t happen here” because America is exceptional is a pathetic cope that ignores the iron laws of politics and economics, which the US is not exempt from. The only thing exceptional is the level of befuddlement that many experts will find themselves in once the US inevitably careens into the abyss of social and economic decadence if the country’s leaders don’t get their act together.",1
540,A Better Solution: Tax Rocks or Churches,"The Biden administration may be realizing that a corporate minimum tax is inconsistent with the multitudinous tax preferences that Leviathan himself gives corporations in order that they do what he wants them to do. Here is another idea to finance the $2.3 billion of proposed “infrastructure” or whatever pleases Leviathan: tax rocks instead.

The proposal is succinctly explained in my article “Joe Biden’s Economic Agenda: An Early Appraisal,” in the Spring issue of Regulation:

However, corporations don’t pay taxes any more than, say, rocks do: if the government were to tax rocks, the actual incidence of the tax would fall on some flesh‐and‐blood individuals. In the case of corporations, those individuals are some combination of shareholders, employees, and consumers.

If it is feared that people would just get rid of all the rocks they possess, there is a large number of other, more sticky, candidates for a tax that would not officially target individuals. The government could tax pets, cars, bees, marriage contracts, or churches. In the latter case, perhaps God will pay? Another idea: tax pension funds and 401k’s that hold corporate stocks. (An estimate puts at 30% the proportion of American corporations’ stocks that are owned by American households’ retirement accounts.)

541,Hayek on High Prices for 10 Seconds of Work,"Even economists who regard themselves as definitely immune to the crude materialist fallacies [i.e., thinking in terms of material wealth] constantly commit the same mistake where activities directed toward the acquisition of such practical knowledge are concerned—apparently because in their scheme of things all such knowledge is supposed to be “given.”

This is from Friedrich Hayek, “The Use of Knowledge in Society,” American Economic Review, September 1945.

I thought of this passage today when I took my iPhone to an independent repair shop. I pointed out to the guy, Steve, that the usual plug into my iPhone didn’t fit. I speculated that it was because the one in my car had left a little piece in there and showed him the cord from my car, which looked as if it had lost a piece.

Steve told me it’s because I bought a low-quality cord. He got a little tool and took all of 10 seconds to pull a little piece out of the phone and Voila, the normal cord fit. So I bought a new 6-foot cord from him for $15. He said it was higher quality and it looked it.

“How much do I owe you for fixing the phone?” I asked.

“Twenty dollars,” he replied, and then quickly, “That’s the charge for my experience and wisdom.”

“Sounds right to me,” I answered and handed him my MasterCard.

Illegal English Channel crossing reach new high

Unlawful crossing via the English Channel have reached intense levels with official figures showing 1,406 ‘asylum seekers’ in 30 boats have reached Britain since the start of the year.

Between January and March 2021, 434 more migrants arrived than during the same period last year. With March seeing the single highest number of the total this year at 831.

According to reporting by think tank Migration Watch UK and Home Office figures, only one in every 40 migrants who made the channel crossing have been returned since 2019.

Minister for Immigration, Compliance and Justice Chris Philp told the media: “People should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach and not make these dangerous journeys.”

He said: “Close work with law enforcement colleagues in France is stopping migrants from leaving French beaches, but there is more work to be done.”

A spokesman for the Home Office said: “We continually balance the need to achieve value for money and reduce the burden on the taxpayer.

“This is measured against meeting our statutory duty to provide asylum seekers, who would otherwise be destitute with safe and secure accommodation and ensuring we minimise the Covid risks for individuals who are detained within our IRCs.”

Labour Councillor Wishes Pandemic Had Happened Before Brexit to “Cull” Leave Voters

Labour Councillor Wishes Pandemic Had Happened Before Brexit to “Cull” Leave Voters

The tolerant left continues to impress with its grace and civility. Nearly five years after the referendum, leaked screenshots sent to Guido reveal how David Everett, a Labour Party councillor for the North West Leicestershire District Council, took to Facebook in September to lament the inconvenient timing of the pandemic, writing (semi-literately):

“As for the […] attention seeking ignoramuses young and old they will Infect each other get the flue and cull themselves. Pity it didn’t happen before the Brexit vote and we would not be leaving the EU. The next disaster which is going to hit us”.

Given the referendum result produced a margin of 1,269,501 votes, it seems either Mr. Everett’s maths isn’t quite up to scratch, or he has serious concerns about a third wave of the virus. Of course, this isn’t as unfortunately timed as the story from earlier this week in which Labour candidate Janette Williamson asked of Prince Phillip “why the f**k isn’t he dead yet?“

The Duke of Edinburgh’s sad death is a sign that our Elizabethan era is coming to an end

In the summer of 1939, King George VI, his wife Queen Elizabeth and their children, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, went on a cruise along the south coast of England in the Royal Yacht, Victoria and Albert. They anchored off the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and here Princess Elizabeth met, for the first time, Prince Philip of Greece.

He had recently enrolled as a naval cadet, and was an impoverished member of the Greek royal family, which was of Danish descent, though like most European royalty he was also descended from Queen Victoria.

Prince Philip was 18, and Princess Elizabeth, who was only 13, was impressed, according to Crawfie, her governess, by how high he could jump.

When the Royal Yacht sailed away, Prince Philip rowed after it long after all the other small boats had obeyed the signal to turn back.

During the Second World War he saw service in the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean and Pacific, was mentioned in dispatches, and saw Princess Elizabeth while he was on leave.

The King said it was too soon to think of marriage, but at Balmoral, in the summer of 1946, Prince Philip proposed to her and she accepted him. Their engagement was not announced until after the royal tour of South Africa during which, on 21st April 1947, Princess Elizabeth marked her 21st birthday by dedicating “my whole life whether it be long or short” to the service of her people “and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong”.

For a few years after their marriage in November 1947, the Duke of Edinburgh, as he became on that day, was able to continue with his career as an able, energetic and ambitious naval officer who was likely to rise, on merit, to the top of the service.

But in February 1952, in Kenya at the start of a tour which was supposed to take them to Australia and New Zealand, the couple received the news of the death, at the age of only 56, of George VI.

Prince Philip had to give up his naval career: for him a severe sacrifice. From now on, he had no choice but to play the supporting role.

He betrayed no hint of self-pity, but got on with it, through rough weather as through dead calms, alleviating boredom by making jokes.

The sadness felt at his death is more profound than many people had expected. That sorrow is a measure of the affection and respect in which he was held.

It is also a recognition of how bereft the Queen will feel without him, and a sign of the melancholy realisation that our Elizabethan age, which is all those of us below the age of 80 can remember, cannot in the nature of things have very many years yet to run.
