Gretchen Whitmer (D) last week asked White House officials if they would consider sending more vaccine doses to her state amid a deadly surge, the state had not ordered 360,000 doses then available, puzzling federal officials who instead advised her to work with experts to make sure Michigan’s supply was being deployed effectively.

But Michigan wasn’t the only state leaving doses on warehouse shelves. At one point last week, 13 states had more than 100,000 doses apiece available and unordered, according to a federal official familiar with the figures who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the matter’s sensitivity. Indiana had only pulled down 90 percent of doses available to the state, leaving 306,000 on the shelves. Texas had ordered 95 percent of its share, leaving 673,000 doses temporarily untouched.

The delays have gained notice inside the federal government, where officials have discussed whether performance metrics, including how quickly states are ordering and using their vaccines, and getting them to vulnerable groups, should be part of allocation decisions, according to three people familiar with the issue. Any new approach, however, would need sign-off from the White House, which has been at pains to avoid the appearance of penalizing some states while boosting others, including by directing additional doses to virus hot spots.

“The fair and equitable way to distribute the vaccine is based on the adult population by state, tribe and territory,” Jeff Zients, coordinator of the White House’s coronavirus task force, said during a Friday briefing. “That’s how it’s been done. And we will continue to do so. The virus is unpredictable. We don’t know where the next increase in cases could occur.”

Experts argue that four months into the immunization campaign, and with more transmissible variants of the virus spreading throughout the country, states should no longer be encountering bottlenecks preventing them from making use of their full vaccine allotments.

“States and their health-care providers need to have the capacity at this point to deliver the vaccines available to them each week,” said Jason L. Schwartz, an assistant professor of health policy at Yale University and a member of Connecticut’s vaccine advisory committee. “We shouldn’t be leaving vaccine doses on the table during this time.”

State and county officials offered different explanations for not ordering their full allocations each week. Many cited the difficulty of matching first and second doses. “We don’t always order all second doses as they may not be needed that week, based on when first doses were used,” said Lynn Sutfin, a spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

Others pointed to reduced demand, staffing challenges and inadequate communication between state and local officials. Mouhanad Hammami, director of the Wayne County Health Department in Michigan, said a sharp and unexplained drop-off in the county’s share of Moderna doses meant it couldn’t operate one of its clinics, ordinarily capable of administering 2,000 doses per day to people in the Detroit area.

Sarah Verschoor, a spokeswoman for the Indiana Department of Health, said unordered doses had been “earmarked for businesses, higher education and local health department clinics that are set to start vaccinating in the coming days.” Chris Van Deusen, a spokesman for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said last week the state’s balance would be gone by last Friday, by which time orders for second doses would be placed. But 145,000 doses remained at week’s end.

In North Carolina, which ended last week with 426,000 doses unordered, state health officials did not respond to requests for comment. All state residents 16 and older became eligible for the shots on Wednesday. Lisa Macon Harrison, health director for Granville-Vance Public Health in the northern part of the state, said orders dipped last week because of spring break.

“This past week was spring break for a lot of communities, and teachers and students and nurses alike had a little break planned,” she said. “In some places, school nurses were not available [to administer shots], and staffing levels across the nation were going to look a little different.”

Michael Fraser, chief executive of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said some states not ordering their full allocations are experiencing soft demand and are developing new strategies to boost interest in the shots. He argued it was too soon to redistribute doses among states.

But ordering delays related to second doses could propel calls for the United States to delay booster shots, as Britain and Israel have done, to ease logistical challenges and give more people some protection. Uncertainties about how much protection first doses offer and how quickly that benefit is conferred also go to the heart of the intensifying debate over whether the federal government should surge vaccine to hot spots. Some argue immunity would not kick in fast enough to help contain the outbreaks, making mitigation strategies a better bet.

“The downside is if the surge is happening now, we know that even with a single dose of Johnson & Johnson, immunity doesn’t really kick in for two to four weeks, while for Pfizer and Moderna, you’re looking at more of a five- to six-week timeline,” said Anuj Mehta, a Denver pulmonologist who chaired Colorado’s advisory group on vaccine prioritization. “And that’s not going to do anything to help the surge.”

Keith English, chair of Michigan State University’s Department of Pediatrics and Human Development, disagreed about that time lag, pointing to a “big falloff in symptomatic cases a couple weeks after the first dose.”

Just as important as surplus doses, he said, is the efficient allocation of doses the state already has available. And where rapid vaccination may be most beneficial is in areas adjacent to outbreaks, such as Washington State, where officials are closely watching a record-breaking surge in British Columbia, even though the U.S.-Canada border remains closed to nonessential travel.

Umair Shah, the state health secretary, said Washington State is not yet receiving sufficient supply to target particular areas of the state, and that such an approach might undermine the ongoing effort to inoculate more of the elderly population. The path of the virus is unpredictable, he said, and a population-based approach is still fairest nationwide as well as within states.

Pressure on the federal government to rethink its strategy has mounted as access to immunization expands nationwide but new infections are concentrated in just a handful of states, including Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Florida and Pennsylvania. Michigan’s seven-day average of new infections rose from 1,503 on March 7 to 7,609 Friday, according to data analyzed by The Washington Post.

The White House’s response to Whitmer last week was echoed Thursday by President Biden, who told her in a call the federal government stood ready to dispatch additional vaccinators to her state to help make use of its supply, according to an administration official with knowledge of the conversation. As for the recommendation to move around vaccine within the state, Whitmer told reporters Friday, “We have done some of that. The problem is when you look at the map, the whole state is a hot spot.”

Early on, officials had considered, but not pursued, “local spread/prevalence of covid-19” as a factor in vaccine allocations, according to a memo distributed last year by the National Association of County and City Health Officials and confirmed by a federal health official involved in the deliberations. Some senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials were doubtful of a strict pro rata approach from the start, according to two officials, with one saying the formula shortchanged large urban areas where people flock for health care even if they live elsewhere.

Federal officials believe one of the reasons states are leaving vaccine on the shelves is their reluctance to order shots they can’t immediately put into arms, either because of limited capacity to administer them or flagging demand. Sending out doses that aren’t quickly administered would push states down in closely watched rankings of vaccination efficiency — which have not been used to determine allocations but nonetheless matter to state officials, who have griped to federal counterparts about the public backlash from the numbers, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Kansas Health Secretary Lee Norman said his state has ordered all of its doses, but that some of his counterparts discussed not doing so during a recent call among state health officers.

Days before leaving office in January, Trump administration officials had unveiled an incentive system that would have rewarded states with additional shots if they quickly used their supply. The Biden administration scrapped that approach and instead retained a population-based formula, even as it gradually directed more vaccine doses to retail pharmacies, community health centers and federally run mass vaccination sites. These locations are selected in part because they’re likely to serve communities of color that are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, say administration officials

Enlarged allotments to pharmacies are also politically fraught because they’re seen as reducing the share of doses made available to governors, who have touted increased allocations to constituents. However, doses directed to pharmacies generally have been administered more efficiently.

Zients told governors on a recent call that states had on average administered about 80 percent of the doses sent to them, while pharmacies were performing slightly better, at 84 percent, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The Post. There was wide variation among states, Zients said, with the top 10 states averaging about 90 percent and the bottom 10 administering about 71 percent of the doses delivered to them.",0
1,Johnson & Johnson vaccine deliveries plunge as company backs off previous April target,"The cuts will make it harder across the country for much of April to find the Johnson & Johnson shot, which some people favor because it requires only one trip to a clinic or vaccination site. The hashtag #OneAndDone has become popular among people receiving it.

D.C. is in line to receive just 1,300 doses of the company’s vaccine next week, down from 10,800 this week, according to the data tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. California will receive 67,000, down from 572,000.

The Biden administration put Johnson & Johnson in control of manufacturing at the Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore last week after 15 million doses of its vaccine were contaminated by another vaccine being made at the plant by AstraZeneca.

Administration officials suggested the problems in ramping up, mostly due to the lack of manufacturing certification at the plant, should be resolved in a matter of weeks.

The rollout of Johnson & Johnson shots, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration in February, has been so slow that it is not yet a significant factor in the U.S. vaccination surge, which has been fueled by the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna two-shot vaccines.

Only 5 million Johnson & Johnson shots have been administered, according to CDC data, compared with 170 million shots of the other two vaccines.

“Johnson & Johnson expects a relatively low level of weekly dose delivery until the company secures FDA authorization,” White House coronavirus response coordinator Jeff Zients said Friday at a media briefing. “With FDA authorization, the company expects a cadence of up to 8 million weekly doses total across state and federal channels later in April.”

The company and government have not said when that clearance is expected.

State officials in Maryland were preparing for a longer wait than Zients outlined. Hogan said Friday that White House officials notified him the reduction will extend for three weeks, which cumulatively reduces Maryland’s expected Johnson & Johnson allotment by more than a quarter million doses. Next week’s allotment will be 10,500 for Maryland, a reduction from 88,800 this week, the CDC projected.

“It’s very frustrating,” Hogan said during a news conference, adding that the administration said the doses will be delivered later in May, rather than this month.

“The last thing we wanted to hear about was we were getting less vaccine. We had wanted to continue to ramp up, as they had been promising … We were hoping, with the infrastructure that we built, that we were going to be able to finish a huge chunk of this in April and May, and now it’s going to be a little slower in April,” Hogan said.

Virginia’s allocation will go from 124,700 this week to 14,800 next week, according to the CDC. The drop in supply won’t affect the state’s goal to begin vaccinating people 16 and older by April 18, officials said. But it will affect the pace of those vaccinations when they start happening and may mean that college students who were preparing to receive their doses next week will have to wait another week.

“Everyone who wants to be vaccinated will have a chance to do that by the end of May, at least for a first dose,” Danny Avula, the state’s vaccine coordinator, said in a press conference, adding that the state expects its Johnson & Johnson weekly supply to reach its previous levels by the end of April.

Johnson & Johnson and President Biden’s team have said that the company met its obligations to produce 20 million doses of its vaccine by the end of March. It met that goal with a delivery of 11 million doses last week. The company has imported doses from overseas while the Emergent plant remains unapproved. Domestic capacity will increase further later this year when a partnership with Merck for production at Merck factories bears fruit.

“I do think that the company is doing everything they can,” Zients said at the Friday briefing. “They now have complete responsibility for that whole facility. They have their best people at that plant, and they are partnering with Merck, who has expertise.”

The last time Johnson & Johnson publicly pledged to produce an additional 24 million doses this month was on March 31. Since then, the company in public statements has said only that it will meet a target of 100 million doses delivered by the end of May.

Johnson & Johnson has an unknown volume of doses prepared and ready to distribute once the Emergent plant does win certification.

“The company continues to work closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration toward” manufacturing certification at Emergent’s Baltimore facility, Johnson & Johnson spokesman Jake Sargent said in an email Friday. “The Company expects to deliver nearly 100 million single-shot doses of its coronavirus vaccine to the U.S. Government by the end of May.”

The CDC also said it was evaluating reports in Colorado, Georgia and North Carolina of people feeling faint after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Officials in those states temporarily closed vaccination sites after apparent severe side effects associated with the shots. Heat at a Georgia fairgrounds site may have been a factor, according to local reports.

``CDC is aware of several incidents of vaccine recipients experiencing dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, rapid breathing, and sweating (vasovagal or anxiety-related) symptoms following covid-19 vaccines in Iowa, Colorado, Georgia, and North Carolina,'' the agency said Friday. ``CDC has performed vaccine lot analyses and has not found any reason for concern. Currently CDC and FDA are not recommending health departments stop administering any lots of covid-19 vaccine.

``Covid-19 vaccines are safe and effective,'' CDC added. ``Many people don’t have any side effects after coronavirus vaccines, but some people will have pain or swelling at the injection site or fever, chills, or a headache. These typically don’t last long and are signs that your body is building protection.''

Johnson & Johnson said it was examining the reports and sharing information with the FDA, which is a routine part of side-effect reporting for companies.

Separately, an official from the European Medicines Agency said at a news conference this week it was aware of three cases of blood clots among people in Europe who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, but no definitively link has been established. The agency said the benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh any potential blood clot risks. Johnson & Johnson said it was closely tracking the cases.

``At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the [Johnson & Johnson] coronavirus vaccine,'' the company said. ``We continue to work closely with experts and regulators to assess the data and support the open communication of this information to health care professionals and the public to help ensure that, in the event of a very rare illness, appropriate steps can be taken for quick diagnosis and treatment.''

Extremely rare cases of blood clots have been ``plausibly'' linked to AstraZeneca vaccines by the EMA; that vaccine — which is based on a similar technology to Johnson & Johnson, has not yet been approved in the United States.",0
2,"Trump officials celebrated efforts to change CDC reports on coronavirus, emails show","Then-science adviser Paul Alexander wrote to then-HHS public affairs chief Michael Caputo on Sept. 9, 2020, touting two examples of where he said officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had bowed to his pressure and changed language in their reports, according to an email obtained by the House’s select subcommittee on the coronavirus outbreak.

Pointing to one change — in which CDC leaders allegedly changed the opening sentence of a report about the spread of the virus among younger people after Alexander pressured them — Alexander wrote to Caputo, calling it a “small victory but a victory nonetheless and yippee!!!”

In the same email, Alexander touted another example of a change to a weekly report from the CDC that he said the agency made in response to his demands. The Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR), which offer public updates on scientists’ findings, had been considered sacrosanct for decades and untouchable by political appointees in the past.

Two days later, Alexander appealed to then-White House adviser Scott Atlas to help him dispute an upcoming CDC report on coronavirus-related deaths among young Americans.

Story continues below advertisement

“Can you help me craft an op-ed,” Alexander wrote to Atlas on Sept. 11, alleging the CDC report was “timed for the election” and an attempt to keep schools closed even as Trump pushed to reopen them. “Let us advise the President and get permission to preempt this please for it will run for the weekend so we need to blunt the edge as it is misleading.”

Alexander and other officials also strategized on how to help Trump argue to reopen the economy in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, despite scientists’ warnings about the potential risks.

“I know the President wants us to enumerate the economic cost of not reopening. We need solid estimates to be able to say something like: 50,000 more cancer deaths! 40,000 more heart attacks! 25,000 more suicides!” Caputo wrote to Alexander on May 16, 2020, in an email obtained by the subcommittee.

Story continues below advertisement

“You need to take ownership of these numbers. This is singularly important to what you and I want to achieve,” Caputo added in a follow-up email, urging Alexander to compile additional data on the consequences of virus-related shutdowns.

Atlas, Alexander and Caputo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Many of the Trump officials clashing with government scientists had little or no previous experience in combating infectious disease. Caputo, a GOP political communications consultant and longtime Trump ally, had not previously worked in public health before Trump installed him to oversee the health department’s communications in April 2020.

Story continues below advertisement

Alexander, who was not a physician but recruited as Caputo’s handpicked science adviser, had previously been an unpaid, part-time health professor at Canada’s McMaster University. Atlas was a neuroradiologist and senior fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution who caught the White House’s attention after defending the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic on Fox News.

“Our investigation has shown that Trump Administration officials engaged in a persistent pattern of political interference in the nation’s public health response to the coronavirus pandemic, overruling and bullying scientists and making harmful decisions that allowed the virus to spread more rapidly,” Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), the subcommittee chairman, wrote to Alexander and Atlas.

The subcommittee is seeking additional documents from Alexander, Atlas and others, noting that some of the Trump officials’ correspondence was sent from personal email accounts. Clyburn also is requesting that Alexander and Atlas sit for interviews with his subcommittee’s investigation by May 3.

Story continues below advertisement

Politico first reported on Sept. 11 that Trump appointees had demanded the right to edit the CDC’s reports and won some changes to scientists’ language, prompting Democrats to open an investigation. Caputo took medical leave on Sept. 16, 2020, and HHS announced that Alexander would be “permanently” leaving the agency on the same day.

Alexander had previously spent months battling with scientists over reports that he deemed misleading or insubordinate to Trump, with a particular focus on those detailing the risks of the coronavirus to children. The effort accelerated after the White House last summer installed several new officials as members of the agency’s leadership team, including Nina Witkofsky as acting CDC chief of staff. Witkofsky had previously been a contractor helping plan events for Seema Verma, the Trump administration’s Medicare and Medicaid chief.

“The last 2 MMWR reports have been more positive than usual and I find [that] encouraging,” Alexander wrote to Witkofsky on Aug. 30, according to an email obtained by the subcommittee. “Maybe you are having a huge impact and this is tremendous. Well done!”

Ten days later, Alexander wrote to Caputo, extolling several changes to CDC reports that he claimed were made because of his influence.

For instance, Alexander said he had won changes to the “key opening sentence” of an August report about a coronavirus outbreak at a Georgia summer camp. The draft report’s opening line argued that understanding youth transmission of the coronavirus was “critical for developing guidance for schools and institutes of higher education,” according to Alexander’s email. But that language was removed from the final report and a caveat was inserted to specify that there was “limited data” about spread of the virus among people under the age of 21. The CDC said that the change had been made because of “thoughtful comments” from Alexander and the agency’s leaders.

The Trump appointee continued to demand more revisions, calling for changes to a September MMWR report that concluded that children who contracted the coronavirus in child-care facilities later transmitted the virus to their family members.

Story continues below advertisement

“In my view, the parents got it more likely when they picked up the kids and came into contact with the school personnel or teachers as happens with my wife and I when we pick our kids form [sic] school,” Alexander wrote to Caputo on Sept. 13.

Then-CDC Director Robert Redfield and other Trump appointees repeatedly claimed last year that the agency’s reports had been protected from political interference.

“At no time has the scientific integrity of the MMWR been compromised. And I can say that under my watch, it will not be compromised,” Redfield testified to the Senate on Sept. 16. However, Redfield told CNN last month that then-HHS Secretary Alex Azar and other Trump officials tried to change several MMWRs that they did not like, a charge disputed by Azar.

In emails obtained by the subcommittee, Alexander and others also repeatedly took aim at Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, critiquing his statements about the coronavirus and complaining that Fauci’s calls to close schools last year were disproportionate to his more measured response to prior flu outbreaks that had led to more deaths among children.

“Dr. Fauci has no data, no science to back up what he is saying on school reopen, none … he is scaring the nation wrongfully,” Alexander wrote to 11 senior HHS officials on Aug. 11, arguing that Fauci was unnecessarily alarming parents.

Trump officials also strategized over how to build the president’s case that virus-related shutdowns were creating a more significant health burden than swiftly reopening the economy. Trump repeatedly cheered Republican governors who rolled back coronavirus restrictions last year against scientific advice, even as virus cases in those states later spiked and some governors subsequently paused the reopenings.

“We have to now ‘unscare’ people while as we reopen, we will see blips and spikes in cases and deaths,” Alexander wrote on May 15 to the HHS secretary’s speechwriter, insisting that failing to reopen the economy would “have far greater consequences,” as deaths related to alcohol, drugs, depression and other causes would mount. “We must school them that we will respond to the spikes and hotspots as needed.”

The long-term consequences of last year’s shutdowns are still not clear. CDC officials this week reported that the total number of suicides dropped by 5.6 percent last year, the largest decline in four decades, surprising some officials who had warned of a spike. However, deaths from heart disease rose by 4.8 percent. Meanwhile, total cancer deaths remained flat in 2020, although public health experts warned that many screenings that would’ve caught early cancers were skipped or delayed last year.

Alexander, Atlas and others also repeatedly drafted op-eds intended to provide an alternative message to government scientists’ warnings, including five possible op-eds detailed in emails obtained by the subcommittee.

One email from Alexander to Atlas on Sept. 3 proposed an “op-ed on possible damage to children immune systems with lock downs and masks,” arguing to Atlas that “I do think locking down our kids (and healthy adults) and masking them can dampen their functional immune systems.”",0
3,Biden unveils commission to study possible expansion of Supreme Court,"The commission, however, is likely to disappoint liberals who are looking for quick action to blunt the court’s conservative majority, while giving the president cover to avoid wading into the contentious debate. The members are not tasked with giving Biden specific recommendations but rather providing an analysis of a range of proposed changes to the court. The executive order establishing the commission mandates that the group hold public meetings and take input from a range of stakeholders, with the report expected in October.

“The topics it will examine include the genesis of the reform debate; the Court’s role in the Constitutional system; the length of service and turnover of justices on the Court; the membership and size of the Court; and the Court’s case selection, rules, and practice,” the White House said in a statement Friday.

President Donald Trump installed three justices on the Supreme Court, including Barrett, giving conservatives a 6-to-3 advantage for decades and triggering the liberal calls to expand the court.

The announcement comes on the heels of Justice Stephen G. Breyer’s remarks against court expansion this week, warning that it could make the court more political and undermine trust in the institution.

“Structural alteration motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that latter perception, further eroding that trust,” he said in a speech at Harvard Law School on Tuesday.

Most of the commission’s members are academics, and they come from a range of political backgrounds and philosophies. Bob Bauer, a top lawyer on Biden’s campaign, and Cristina Rodríguez, a professor at Yale Law School, will chair the commission, which will be run out of the White House Counsel’s Office.

The panel includes prominent liberals such as Caroline Fredrickson, former president of the American Constitution Society; Laurence Tribe, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School; and Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. The group’s conservative members include Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and former top official in George W. Bush’s Justice Department; Keith Whittington, a professor at Princeton University; and Adam White, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.

But liberals pounced on the announcement, warning that Congress should not wait for the commission’s report and instead take immediate action to overhaul the Supreme Court.

“Congress has the power, and the constitutional duty, to set the size of the court, as it has seven times throughout our history,” Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), a vocal advocate for court expansion, said in a statement. “My colleagues and I need not wait for the findings of a commission. We already know the obvious: we must expand the Supreme Court, before it’s too late.”

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the commission and the liberal push to expand the court a waste of time.

“President Biden knows that he doesn’t even have the votes in his own party to pack the court; he knows that court packing is a non-starter with the American people; and he knows that this commission’s report is just going to be a taxpayer-funded door stopper,” Sasse said in a statement.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) derided the commission, saying the “faux-academic study of a nonexistent problem fits squarely within liberals’ years-long campaign to politicize the court, intimidate its members, and subvert its independence.”

Liberals are also aggressively lobbying Breyer, 82, to retire from the Supreme Court so Biden could replace him with a younger justice while Democrats still control the Senate. The president has promised to nominate the first Black woman to the high court, but White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Biden is not pushing for Breyer to retire.

“He believes that’s a decision Justice Breyer will make when he decides it’s time to no longer serve on the Supreme Court,” she said Friday.

Demand Justice, a liberal group, launched a campaign Friday to pressure Breyer, marking the anniversary of Justice John Paul Stevens’s retirement announcement in 2010.

“We are now firmly in the window when past justices have announced their retirement, so it’s officially worrisome that Justice Breyer has not said yet that he will step down,” Brian Fallon, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “The only responsible choice for Justice Breyer is to immediately announce his retirement so President Biden can quickly nominate the first-ever Black woman Supreme Court justice.”",0
4,Power Up: Breyer's SCOTUS comments prompt renewed calls from progressives to retire,"From the courts

SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO: Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens retired 11 years ago to this day.

And the presidency of Joe Biden, along with an evenly split Senate, has some progressives advocating for the “strategic retirement” of another Supreme Court justice: Stephen G. Breyer.

Story continues below advertisement

Breyer became the court's oldest justice and the senior member of the court's liberal wing after Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death last fall. He gave no indication of plans to retire during a 70-page lecture at Harvard Law School earlier this week as the left's high court minority has dwindled to three seats.

In his remarks, Breyer instead warned against structural reform to the court embraced by some liberal activists and argued it was “wrong to think of the court as another political institution.” His comments have renewed pressure from progressives for Breyer to retire now while Democrats control Washington.

“We're now firmly in the season where the [retirement announcement] should be happening,” Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice — an advocacy group that pushes for a more liberal judiciary — told Power Up. “He's starting to be on borrowed time in outlasting when previous justices have announced their retirements, and his comments make me worried he doesn't get it if he doesn't think the court is unduly conservative right now.”

“It makes me worried [Breyer] doesn't appreciate how important it is he's replaced and that a Democratic nominee is moved without delay in a [Democratic] controlled Senate,” Fallon added.

The pressure on Breyer to retire from other liberal activists is growing.

“These appointments come up so rarely and are not regularized so we have no idea when these opportunities will come up unless justices act strategically and retire under the same party president,” Amanda Hollis-Brusky , an associate professor of politics at Pomona College who has studied judicial nominations, told us.

“Frankly, it's disturbing that justices not only have life time appointments but also get to decide and anoint their successor,” she added, referencing Supreme Court justice Anthony M. Kennedy's request for Trump to consider one of his former clerks, Brett M. Kavanaugh, to replace him.

Democratic senators are also remaining mum about Breyer's future, which frustrates activists who want them to approach the courts as strategically as Senate Republicans.

Liberal attention to the courts has waxed and waned in recent years. After pressure to respond aggressively to Republicans judicial campaigns that have transformed the court – including the swift replacement of Ginsburg less than 50 days before the 2020 election – the Biden White House has tepidly moved forward on the issue.

Biden opposes what is known as “court packing” in which the number of justices on the high court would be expanded. He's instead appointed a bipartisan commission to craft recommendations over the course of 180 days. But radical changes proposed by progressives are unlikely.

“ I can't say for sure whether the results of that process will be revolutionary but early signs don't indicate that they would be,” Hollister Brusky told us. “Biden has not committed to that either— he's an institutionalist… He's going to make smart decisions about who he appoints to the court -- but I don't see him as someone thinking about out of the box ways of reform and restructure the judiciary under his presidency.”

Federal court change—commission-motivated or otherwise—has largely been incremental. Support is typically diffuse and opposition well-organized,” per the Brookings Institute's Russell Wheeler.

Biden has thus far announced a list of 11 judicial candidates he intends to nominate to serve as judges for the federal circuit, district court and superior court.

The full list of names of those on the commission – one of eight court commissions in the last half-century – has yet to be released by the White House, though it's expected imminently.

Fallon, however, is hopeful momentum for reform of the courts will pick up again once a bill on structural changes being crafted by congressional Democrats is introduced in the coming weeks.

“That has the potential to provide something to rally around regardless of the approach the Biden commission takes,” Fallon added. “I won't be surprised if they endlessly debates a couple proposals without ratifying any — that's often what these commissions are designed to be.”

Aaron Belkin, the director of the advocacy group Take Back the Court, is heartened by what he sees as the politics shifting ""incredibly"" on expanding the high court.

""The politics continue to shift rapidly,"" Belkin told us. ""There's now a universal understanding of the danger and partisanship of the courts and the politics of judicial reform... we have just begun the conversation.""

""I don't think the question is whether Breyer should retire and I don't think it's appropriate for elected officials to tell justices when they should end their careers,"" Belkin added. ""My personal opinion? Sure. He should retire but that won't fix the courts.""

The investigations

COOPERATION COULD OPEN THE FLOOD-GAETZ: Joel Greenberg, “a Florida politician at the center of an investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), is negotiating with federal prosecutors to resolve his own sex-trafficking and other charges, a potentially ominous sign for Gaetz if his associate decides to cooperate in a bid for leniency,” our colleagues Barbara Liston, Matt Zapotosky and Michael Scherer report.

“The Justice Department has been exploring whether Greenberg procured women for Gaetz and whether the two men sometimes shared sexual partners, including the 17-year-old girl at issue in Greenberg’s case.”

Details: “In two late-night Venmo transactions in May 2018, Gaetz sent Greenberg $900. The next morning, over the course of eight minutes, Greenberg used the same app to send three young women varying sums of money,” “In two late-night Venmo transactions in May 2018, Gaetz sent Greenberg $900. The next morning, over the course of eight minutes, Greenberg used the same app to send three young women varying sums of money,” the Daily Beast’s Jose Pagliery and Roger Sollenberger report . “When Greenberg made his Venmo payments to these three young women, he described the money as being for ‘Tuition,’ ‘School,’ and ‘School.’”

Latest Gaetz Gate developments: “Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) called on Gaetz to resign Thursday night, making him the first Republican to do so,” Politico’s Nancy Vu reports.

At the White House

HAPPENING TODAY: “The White House plans to release an outline of President Biden’s spending priorities,” Bloomberg’s Roxana Tiron and Anthony Capaccio report. “The plan had been widely expected last week, but its release was delayed in part because of disagreements over defense spending.”

“Biden plans to request $715 billion for his first Pentagon budget, a decrease from Trump-era spending trends.”

CHAUVIN MURDER TRIAL UPDATE: Martin Tobin, a Chicago-area pulmonologist and critical-care doctor who specializes in the science of breathing, testified Thursday that “the pressure of Derek Chauvin’s knees on George Floyd’s neck and back made it virtually impossible for the handcuffed man to breathe as he was pinned face down on a street and would have killed any healthy person,” our colleague Holly Bailey reports.

“Isenschmid said that while fentanyl was found in Floyd's blood, so was norfentanyl, which is metabolized fentanyl. Overdose victims who die rarely have norfentanyl in their blood, he said.”

Happening today: “Prosecutors are expected to call Hennepin County Medical Examiner Andrew Baker [who] performed the autopsy on Floyd.”

UNCERTAINTY LOOMS FOR AMAZON UNION: “The union trying to organize workers at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., sounded a pessimistic note Thursday as a partial tally showed votes against the union with an early and widening lead,” our colleague Jay Greene reports. “The union is fighting to represent 5,805 workers at the facility in one of the most high-profile labor battles in years.”

“With roughly half the 3,215 ballots counted, no votes hit 1,100 while yes votes totaled 463. The count was scheduled to resume [today].”

“The incomplete tally put Amazon on the cusp of defeating the most serious organized-labor threat in the company’s history. In a high-profile campaign since the fall, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union aimed to establish the first union at an Amazon warehouse in the United States. The result will have major implications not only for Amazon but also for organized labor and its allies,” the New York Times’s Karen Weise and Michael Corkery report

Amazon has gone to great lengths to fight unionization. “Emails among U.S. Postal Service employees in January and February show that Amazon pressed the agency to install a mailbox outside the warehouse, a move the union contends is a violation of labor laws,” per Greene.

“The union has complained about the mailbox, which the Postal Service installed just before the start of mail-in balloting in early February. It has argued that the mailbox could lead workers to think Amazon has some role in collecting and counting ballots, which could influence their votes.” The mailbox does not have any U.S. Postal Service markings.

But “Amazon spokeswoman Heather Knox said that the mailbox’s placement was intended to make voting easy and that the company proposed a variety of options to do so.”

Global power

THE VACCINE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS: “Priority-supply deals, export restrictions and other means of hoarding by rich nations have contributed to a severe global supply crunch and left many countries scrambling,” our colleague Emily Rauhala reports.

“As of Thursday, just short of 20 percent of the U.S. population was fully vaccinated, giving some 66 million people a strong measure of protection against a disease that has already killed more than 500,000 Americans.”

“While the United States administers millions of inoculations a day, some countries are still waiting for their first shots to arrive. A recent WHO estimate suggested that just 2 percent of the 690 million doses administered to date globally went to Africa.”

A world of difference. “The world’s least wealthy continent, Africa, is also the least vaccinated. Of its 54 countries, only three have inoculated more than 1% of their populations. More than 20 countries aren’t even on the board yet,” “The world’s least wealthy continent, Africa, is also the least vaccinated.

5,"He was arrested at a Black Lives Matter protest. Now, he’s warning others about Florida’s anti-riot proposal.","As they were finishing up, a pickup truck with a Confederate flag pressed into the crowd. Demonstrators surrounded the driver and began shouting political slogans and expletives.

Then someone yanked the flag off the truck and threw it on the ground. Others stomped on it and attempted to set it on fire. Police moved in, and Brooks, who is Black, was arrested and charged with inciting a riot and resisting a police officer.

Story continues below advertisement

Authorities later dropped the rioting charge against Brooks. But his case exemplifies the legal peril that Florida residents could soon face under sweeping anti-protest legislation championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), which would make it easier for someone to be sent to prison for participating in a protest that becomes unruly.

The measure was approved last month by the state House of Representatives; a Senate committee is debating the bill Friday.

Under the proposal, a person who attends a protest that becomes violent can be charged with a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison. The crime rises to a second-degree felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison, if 25 or more people are present at a disruptive event.

The bill would also create stiff penalties for defacing or destroying a historical monument or flag, in effect providing protection to the symbols of Florida's Confederate heritage, experts say.

Brooks and other Black Floridians say the legislation would silence their opposition to Confederate symbols while handing police even more power.

“Freedom of speech and freedom to protest is what America was founded on,” said Brooks, who works in a Plant City seafood processing plant. “I should have a right to speak out about an era that subjugated me.”

Florida’s legislation, referred to as House Bill 1, is part of a wave of Republican proposals to crack down on protesters.

According to a database maintained by the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, state lawmakers have introduced 92 anti-protest bills since Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer last May.

Many of the bills include proposals that would make it a felony to block traffic, loosen the definitions of what constitutes a riot, and bolster civil immunity and stand-your-ground firearms laws when deadly force is used against rioters.

“I call them kitchen-sink-type bills because they are throwing the kitchen sink at protesters, and many are written with vague language so police and prosecutors can use the language in targeted ways,” said Elly Page, a senior legal adviser to ICNL.

The language in many of the bills is nearly identical, Page said, though ICNL has not determined whether the text is coming from a central group or whether lawmakers are copying each other.

Republicans have defended the laws as a necessary protection against violent agitators, and say they don’t target specific activists.

“We do not need to have Miami or Orlando or Jacksonville become Kenosha [Wis.] or Seattle or Portland,” Fla. Rep. Cord Byrd (R) said at a recent floor debate on the bill, referring to cities that saw violent Black Lives Matter protests last summer. “We have the ability to act now to say: You can peacefully assemble in Florida . . . But you cannot harm other people. You cannot destroy their property. You cannot destroy their lives.”

The bill’s Democratic opponents, meanwhile, invoked the nation’s storied history of political dissent.

“This bill muddies the waters in a very real way that will allow peaceful protesters to get swept up in arrests,” Florida Rep. Ben Diamond (D) said at the debate.

Brooks says his own life in Plant City highlights why so many Black Florida residents are concerned about House Bill 1.

Located 25 miles east of Tampa, Plant City was developed around a South Florida Railroad stop in the 1800s. It bills itself as the “winter strawberry capital of the world.”

Like many areas of the South, Plant City was once mostly segregated. Well into the 20th Century, the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups held considerable sway there.

In recent decades, as the outer suburbs of Tampa and Orlando began to stretch into town, race relations have improved. But Black Plant City residents, who make up about 14 percent of the population, say they still face discrimination. Black residents, for example, have long questioned why a Black female contestant has never been named “Strawberry Queen” at the annual Strawberry Festival.

“There have been a lot of changes here, but there is still a lot of hidden racism and implicit bias,” said Kenny Griffin, 39, a Black community leader who grew up in Plant City. He said it was still common in the 1990s for his White high school classmates to threaten to “burn a cross” in his yard.

“So when we saw what happened to George Floyd, we decided to march here, too,” he said.

Brooks saw the June 2 march as an opportunity to stand up against the injustice he believes he faced as a teenager.

In 2007, when Brooks was 17, police and prosecutors arrested Brooks and accused him of violating Florida's “RICO Act,” designed to combat organized crime. Brooks said he and about a dozen friends were charged with racketeering, which carried a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

At the time, Brooks was part of a loose-knit group of Black youths that called themselves the “Black Mob.” Brooks said he and his friends committed some crimes, including car thefts and burglaries.

But he denies that his friends were operating as a gang or organized crime ring, and said that his lawyer at the time — a public defender — encouraged him to plead guilty “for something I was really innocent of.”

“We were just kids who grew up together, and were not shooting people or killing people, but the Plant City police department decided to round us all up,” Brooks said. Racketeering “is a charge you give the Mafia or the Mob, not 16- or 17-year-old kids.”

Both the Plant City Police and the Hillsborough County state’s attorney’s office declined to comment on those cases.

A law enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, said at the time police and prosecutors in Florida were using the RICO statue to break up gangs accused of committing serious crimes that crossed jurisdictional boundaries.

After he pleaded guilty to armed robbery and racketeering, Brooks was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He started reading books – sometimes more than a book a day – about Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders.

“When you read their stories, you understand they came from a similar background as me, and I finally found someone I can relate to,” Brooks said.

Brooks was released from prison in 2016 after serving 8 1/2 years of his sentence. After being rejected for most jobs because of his felony record, Brooks found a job stacking pallets of fish and shrimp at a seafood processing plant. He was eventually promoted to plant production manager.

As he marched around Plant City during the demonstration, Brooks said he thought of childhood friends who remain in prison on 20-year sentences for violating Florida’s RICO Act.

“We marched because we are facing injustices. Maybe things have died down from Jim Crow and hanging people on trees, but [racism] still affects us,” Brooks said.

Hasani Jackson, a Black Plant City resident and middle-school teacher, described the protest as “full of young people, of all different cultures.”

“Nothing like that ever happens here,” Jackson, 43, said. “I’ve never seen so many people in Plant City come out without fear.”

But as the protest was winding down, a truck started following the demonstrators, who were marching on the highway with a police escort following behind.

As the truck moved into the crowd, someone ripped off the Confederate flag, and demonstrators began stomping on it and “attempted to set it on fire,” Jackson said.

Lt. Alfred Van Duyne, a spokesman for the Plant City Police Department, said officers had identified Brooks as the suspect who grabbed the flag, sparking a confrontation.

Brooks denies this.

Brooks’s attorney, Erin Hardister, noted that the Hillsborough County state’s attorney dropped the charge of inciting a riot, citing a lack of evidence against him. But Hardister said the incident — including the officers’ failure to also arrest the truck driver — demonstrates how “dangerous and unnecessary” House Bill 1 is and how easily it can be inequitably enforced.

(The driver of the truck was not arrested because he fled the scene, Van Duyne said.)

The bill states a person could be sentenced to five years in prison for causing at least $200 damage to a memorial — which includes a flag — or historic property, and up to 15 years in prison if they destroy them.

Kara Gross, legislative director for the ACLU of Florida, said the anti-rioting provisions of the bill also mean someone like Brooks could find it far harder in the future to get a prosecutor to drop rioting charges because they will no longer have to prove someone “engaged in violent behavior.”

“You just have to be present at a protest that turns violent,” Gross said.

So, at least for now, Brooks said there will be one less person there the next time residents in Plant City decide to hold a racial justice protest. Brooks will be at home.

“I don’t want to jeopardize everything,” he said. “I’ve worked too hard to put it all on the line.”",0
6,"Live updates Medical examiner says restraint, neck compression were ‘more than Mr. Floyd could take’","Nelson, the defense attorney, pressed Baker on factors besides police restraint that Baker noted in his autopsy.

Under cross-examination, Baker affirmed that he found Floyd’s heart conditions to be “pretty significant” and did not point to asphyxia, in contrast to other experts called by the prosecution.

The medical examiner said he would expect to see bruising from force to Floyd’s neck sufficient for asphyxiation — “but I don’t know that the lack of bruising excludes that,” he said. He also did not report apparent brain damage from asphyxia but noted that in many cases a victim dies too quickly for it to show up.

Baker also addressed the methamphetamine and fentanyl found in Floyd’s system.

Earlier this week, the prosecution called an expert who assessed the level of methamphetamine in Floyd’s blood as “low” and on par with someone who had been prescribed the drug. Baker affirmed that methamphetamine is a “stimulant” that causes the heart to beat faster and “work harder.”

“I’m not aware that there’s a quote-unquote safe level of methamphetamine,” Baker said.

Baker said Floyd displayed what could be a “fatal” level of fentanyl, but he emphasized that drug concentrations are very “context dependent” and need to be interpreted with other circumstances.

He said his conversations with local prosecutors about the drug findings “almost certainly went something like this: Had Mr. Floyd been home alone in his locked residence with no evidence of trauma and the only autopsy finding was that fentanyl level, then, yes, I would certify his death was due to fentanyl toxicity.”

Recounting his earlier statements to federal officials, Baker reiterated his belief that Floyd “experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest in the context of law enforcement’s subdual restraint and neck compression.”",0
9,"Prince Philip, royal consort to Queen Elizabeth II, dies at 99","When Prince Philip hit the world stage after World War II as then-Princess Elizabeth’s dashing suitor, he was seen as a tall, blond, athletic Viking who would breathe life into the fusty institution of the British monarchy.

They were married in 1947, and with Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953, the couple came to embody a way forward for a shrinking world power experiencing postwar privation and the dismantling of its global empire. The attractive young queen and her dashing husband were regarded as glittering celebrities in the postwar age.

Prince Philip was born into the Greek royal family, and he traced his ancestry to the royalty of Denmark, Germany, Russia and Britain. He and Elizabeth were cousins, two great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.

As royal consort, Prince Philip had been at his wife’s side — actually, two paces behind in public, as required by protocol — since she became the queen upon her father’s death in 1952. At her coronation at Westminster Abbey the next year, Prince Philip knelt before the sitting queen and pledged to be her “liegeman,” or faithful servant, for life. This he was, in joint appearances with the queen and, more often, in a continual round of his own official duties until retiring from public life in 2017.

He was an active outdoorsman, hunter, equestrian, aviator and sailor, and he championed causes and institutions close to his heart, including a public service and fitness program for youth, global wildlife conservation, and various sporting organizations.

After a long career in the public eye, Prince Philip was respected but not wildly popular among Britons, who came to rely on him to put his foot in his mouth on occasion. This image was nourished by the British press he came to loathe.

To the Paraguayan despot Alfredo Stroessner in 1963: “It’s a pleasure to be in a country that isn’t ruled by its people.” While touring China in 1986, he described parts of Beijing as “ghastly” and joked with a British student that he would end up “slitty-eyed” if he stayed too long. He later said he had been misquoted and had actually said “slit-eyed.”

Over the years, his unfiltered remarks and attempts at humor became legendary for their bad taste. “I thought it was against the law these days for a woman to solicit,” he once said to a female solicitor in a reception line. To a blind woman with a guide dog, he remarked, “Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?”

During a visit to Scotland in 1995, he asked a driving instructor: “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?” Age did not make him more decorous. At 90, he asked a disabled man in an electric wheelchair, “How many people have you knocked over this morning on that thing?”

His image as a headstrong contrarian was reinforced in 2019, when at age 97 he crashed his SUV into a vehicle carrying three people, including a 9-month-old boy. The prince agreed to surrender his driving license but not before being seen two days after the accident driving, without a seat belt, in a replacement SUV.

Prince Philip made little effort to hide his disdain for tabloid journalists, whom he accused of ruining his life and turning the increasingly turbulent lives of the British royal family into a soap opera.

Biographers paint a much more complex version of Prince Philip. They described him as an alpha male, brusque, sometimes rude — even to the queen — but one who worked hard to support her and give a modern gloss to the 1,000-year-old institution of the English monarchy. In addition to streamlining the daily workings of Buckingham Palace, he became a prominent voice for British industry and technology.

Constrained by a public role that kept him out of politics and in his wife’s shadow, he privately took a less fettered stance as a husband, father and father-in-law. He was furious when he suspected Princess Diana, while still married to his son Prince Charles, of cooperating on a book that disparaged the royals, but he also wrote her direct but kindly letters that sought to comfort her during her breakup with Charles (they separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996). In one, he wrote, “I cannot imagine anyone in their right mind leaving you for Camilla,” referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, who was to become Charles’s wife and the Duchess of Cornwall.

Prince Philip misread the public antipathy to the royal family in the days after Diana’s death in a car crash in 1997. He agreed with the queen that they should remain at Balmoral Castle in Scotland to shield Diana and Charles’s children — Prince William, then 15, and Prince Harry, 12 — from the media-fed public outpouring of grief and anger in London. But when they returned for Diana’s funeral, it was Prince Philip’s gentle persuasion that convinced the young princes to walk behind their mother’s hearse at St. James’s Palace. “If you don’t walk,” he told William, “you may regret it later. If I walk, will you walk with me?”

Lord Brabourne, who married Prince Philip’s cousin, told royal biographer Gyles Brandreth that “Philip is not sentimental but he is sensitive, profoundly so.”

Just as Prince Philip was preparing to remove himself from public life, the Netflix series “The Crown” came along to shine its light on the bumps in his early married life. The caged alpha male was rumored to have had a few dalliances. Although never substantiated, the reports provided the basis for “The Crown” episodes that played up liaisons, including one with the (real) Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova.

“Have you ever stopped to think that for the last 40 years, I have never moved anywhere without a policeman accompanying me?” he told the Independent in 1992. “So how the hell could I get away with anything like that?”

A 'tough, hard' commander

Philip Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg was born June 10, 1921, on the dining room table — deemed the most manageable location by the doctor — of his parents’ home on the Greek island of Corfu.

Within a year of his birth, the family was whisked out of Greece as his father, Prince Andrea, or Andrew, was about to be executed for a bungled military campaign against Turkey. (The Greek royal family, descended from royal households in northern Europe, was invited to Greece in the 19th century.)

Philip grew up as a displaced child in what would become a broken home. The family lived in Paris for most of the 1920s, but Philip was sent to a boarding school in England when he was 8. Soon after, his mother, Princess Alice, was committed to a mental hospital in Switzerland, and his father left her to live in the south of France. Within a year, Philip’s four older sisters had all married German noblemen.

When he was 12, Philip moved to a novel boarding school in Germany, Schloss Salem, set up by his sister’s father-in-law and an eccentric but brilliant educationist named Kurt Hahn. Hahn, who was Jewish, fled to Britain after an arrest by the Nazis, and then established on the northeast coast of Scotland a similar boys’ school with an emphasis on building character.

The school, Gordonstoun, became noted for the physical hardships visited on its boys, which included early-morning cold showers. Philip arrived at the school in 1934 and took to it like a duck to water, literally. He learned to sail in the cold, stormy waters of the nearby bay.

“I was wet, cold, miserable, probably sick and often scared stiff,” he told Brandreth, “but I would not have missed the experience for anything.”

Two of his brothers-in-law became proud Nazis, and when Philip returned to Germany in 1937 for his sister Cecile’s funeral — she was killed in a plane crash — the cortege included a contingent of high-ranking Nazis in full regalia. A few years later, as a young lieutenant in the Royal Navy, Philip saw action against Italian and German forces and left little doubt about his wartime allegiances.

In 1938, with war looming, he went to Britain’s naval academy in Dartmouth, on the south coast of England, to follow a family tradition of naval service. Both his uncle, Louis “Dickie” Mountbatten, and grandfather before him rose to the highest ranks of the Royal Navy. Mountbatten served as the supreme allied commander in Southeast Asia during World War II and became the last viceroy of India before independence.

When Philip became a British citizen, in 1947, he took Mountbatten as his surname.

During a visit to the naval college by the royal family, less than two months before the outbreak of World War II, Philip, then 18, entertained Princess Elizabeth, who was just 13 and was soon smitten by the lissome, blue-eyed cadet.

As Philip served in the British navy during the war, he and Elizabeth corresponded and met several times. His highly ambitious uncle sought a role as matchmaker, but Philip said he didn’t consider marriage until 1946.

At the couple’s wedding a year later, Philip was created Duke of Edinburgh and granted other titles. When he became a British citizen, he lost his Greek title, but he was named a prince again, this time of the United Kingdom, by his wife 10 years later.

Philip loved the order of naval life, and in 1950, when he was given command of his first frigate, the Magpie, he was determined to run a tight ship. Tim Heald, another biographer, said Philip’s command “was a success. He was tough, hard, mucked in with everybody, and if he had a fault it was a tendency to intolerance.”

Although he had married the heir to the British throne, he had expected his father-in-law, King George VI, to live for an additional 20 years or more, and he looked forward to a long naval career. But the king became terminally ill, and even before his death in 1952, Philip had to give up his ship for what would become a life as the queen’s consort. In time, he served as a leader or member of more than 780 organizations, including the World Wildlife Fund.

In a 1992 interview with the Independent, he still bristled at the thought of having given up his military career. “It was not my ambition to be president of the Mint Advisory Committee. I didn’t want to be president of WWF. I was asked to do it,” he said. “I’d much rather have stayed in the Navy, frankly.”

He spent decades promoting British industry, and on his tours of factories and plants, he would question the way a place was run. This argumentative stance became a hallmark of his public persona. Heald accompanied him on a tour of a distillery near Glasgow during which the prince was told that the juniper berries for making gin were imported.

“But good heavens,” he exclaimed, “there are juniper bushes all over Scotland. Why on Earth do you need to import them?”

Paternal pragmatist

Although Prince Philip passed on many interests to his eldest son, Prince Charles — polo, painting, architectural preservation, Jungian theories, even theology — the two had different personalities and a difficult relationship. “He’s a romantic,” Prince Philip told Brandreth, “and I’m a pragmatist.”

In her book “The Diana Chronicles,” journalist Tina Brown wrote of the time that Prince Philip sent his son a letter to tell him to make up his mind about marrying Diana. Philip had grown cranky by the press frenzy surrounding the romance.

Brown and other biographers have said Prince Philip was simply trying to get his son to make a decision for the sake of Diana’s reputation, but Charles read it as a stern directive to marry — with historically disastrous consequences.

“Any missive from Philip made Charles overreact,” Brown writes. “He carried the letter around in his pocket to show to family and friends as proof of his father’s intolerable bullying.”

Besides the queen, survivors include four children, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward; eight grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.

If a personal library is revealing of the owner’s character and interests, Heald’s account of Prince Philip’s is particularly illuminating. By 1990, it had grown to more than 8,000 volumes. He had 560 books on birds, 456 on religion, 373 on horses and 352 on the navy and ships.

“All is well ordered, disciplined, catalogued efficiency. These are the books of a man who might want to look something up in a hurry,” Heald writes.

Between the prince and the queen, the image persisted of what the London Independent once described as “mutually comfortable routine.” They had separate bedrooms for the most part. He brooked little tolerance for her passions — Welsh corgis and horse racing — and she let him pursue his hobbies alone. He was often on tour abroad, while she attended to duties close to home.",0

But when they strolled out of Westminster Abbey in 1947 as husband and wife, Princess Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, who died Friday at 99, embarked on a love story for the ages.

Though the popular Netflix show “The Crown,” portrayed Prince Philip as unhappy in those early days, the truth is that “Prince Philip took on the unlikely role of champion to his wife and became both mother and father to their children, allowing the queen to deal with the requirements of her position,” according to royal biographer Ingrid Seward’s 2018 book on their marriage.

“Even after seven decades,” Seward wrote, “the Queen’s face lights up when Philip enters a room.”

They first laid eyes on each other in 1939.

She was 13, prim and proper. He was 18 and unrefined — a dashing cadet at Britannia Royal Naval College. Europe was months away from being consumed by World War II.

Margaret Rhodes, the queen’s cousin, wrote in her 2011 autobiography, “The Final Courtesy,” that “Elizabeth was truly in love from the very beginning.”

During the war, the two exchanged letters. Philip served in the Royal Navy while she was shuffled from palace to palace as Britain was being bombed. She eventually was settled with her younger sister, Margaret, at Windsor Castle.

Marion Crawford, who served as their governess, wrote in her memoir, “The Little Princesses,” that Elizabeth was smitten with Philip’s arresting blue eyes and Viking good looks.

But they waited until after the war to get engaged. When the crowds cheered their wedding at Westminster Abbey in 1947, neither of them expected she would be crowned queen anytime soon. Her father, King George VI, was in his early 50s. Philip, named Duke of Edinburgh, intended to continue his career in the navy. But the king died five years into their marriage, and Elizabeth became queen at the age of 25.

Philip was forced to quit his naval career. In 1992, he told an interviewer, “I’d much rather have stayed in the navy, frankly.” He later called his resignation “naturally disappointing.” By many accounts, there was real tension in the marriage, and “The Crown” strongly hints that Philip was a serial cheater.

But he and Elizabeth endured, traveling the world together and producing four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. According to Tatler, which chronicles the lives of the British royals, he teased her in private, calling her “Lilibet"" and “Sausage.” Or sometimes just “Darling.”

Early in their marriage, Philip often took on the role of homemaker while his wife attended official events, according to Philip Eade’s book, “Prince Philip: The Turbulent Early Life of the Man Who Married Queen Elizabeth II."" He hung pictures and moved chairs at one of the flats they shared. He loved gadgets, once picking up an electric mixer.

He even bought Elizabeth a gift that scores of husbands through the years have gifted their wives — a washing machine.

“Philip was an avid homemaker,” Eade wrote.

But he was also a frustrated one. Philip did not like all the formality. He preferred carrying his own bag, making his own martinis and talking to people himself — not through memos or messengers. While he yearned to have his old military career back, royal observers have written, Philip eventually came to enjoy his role as Elizabeth’s sidekick.

If marriage is a constant give and take between husband and wife, so it was between the queen and her prince.

The queen’s job demanded she be a rigid traditionalist. But Philip was decidedly not a traditionalist in filling his royal duties.

He refused, Eade wrote, to have his speeches written by a committee of palace public relations officials. Instead, he wrote his own or simply spoke from the cuff, often leading to notable gaffes. Philip also still insisted on hanging out with his old pals at clubs, which led to constant rumors of infidelity.

But the unlikely marriage would survive Philip’s fierce independence.

One of the last public images of them together was on their 73rd anniversary last year.

Prince Philip was married for more than seven decades to Elizabeth. He was born into the Greek royal family, with royal roots connecting him to the monarchies of Denmark, Germany, Russia and Britain.

He and Elizabeth shared the same great-great grandmother.

Philip’s initial years were tumultuous: Soon after his birth, his family fled Greece following death threats against his father, King Andrew. As a child he spent time at boarding schools in England and Germany, where his sisters settled, both marrying German princes and joining the Nazi party.

A former British naval officer, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947. They met in 1939, when she was 13 and he 18. At the time of their marriage, he was seen as dashing, charismatic and a breath of fresh air for Britain’s centuries-old monarchy. He was granted the title of Duke of Edinburgh.

When Elizabeth was coronated in 1953, a kneeling Philip pledged to be her “liegeman,” or faithful servant, for life. He kept that promise, becoming the longest-serving royal consort in British history.

Philip was known as an active outdoorsman and promoted youth fitness. Biographers have described him as dedicated to the queen but having an alpha male persona. He expressed frustration with the need to give up his military service after Elizabeth became queen.

His public appearance was also defined by repeated gaffes and racist, sexist and classist remarks over the decades. He had a contentious relationship with Britain’s tabloid press.

In recent years, controversies over his legacy, such as rumors of infidelity, were revived by way of the hit Netflix show on the queen’s reign, “The Crown.”

He and Elizabeth had four children — Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward — and eight grandchildren.

What will the funeral be like and who will attend?

Philip “passed away peacefully” at Windsor Castle, according to a statement on the Buckingham palace website. He and the queen had spent the pandemic at Windsor Castle, largely out of the public’s sight.

Now, questions are swirling over what the funeral will look like and who will attend — including whether Harry and Meghan will fly in from the United States.

Plans had already been drawn up for the prince’s funeral, though they must be tailored to meet Britain’s coronavirus-related restrictions. Britain just emerged from its third lockdown and large gatherings are banned. Ordinarily, large crowds would flock to London to attend the royal ceremony.

Instead, according to the College of Arms, which is involved with the funeral plans, Philip will not have a state funeral or lie in state at Westminster Palace.

""His Royal Highness’s body will lie at rest in Windsor Castle ahead of the funeral in St George’s Chapel. This is in line with custom and with His Royal Highness’s wishes,” the College of Arms said in a statement Friday, Reuters reported.

“The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the covid-19 pandemic and it is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral.”

The prince, reportedly, did not want a large funeral or some of the other formal ceremonies afforded to certain members of the royal family.

Buckingham Palace released a statement requesting that crowds not gather in light of the pandemic. Instead of leaving flowers, as is customary , it suggested mourners donate to a charity or sign an online book of condolences.

The palace also it would release more details regarding the funeral in the coming days.

Whether Harry and Meghan will attend remains unknown. England’s current rules limit funeral attendance to 30 and require social distancing and face masks. Travelers from abroad are required to quarantine and test negative for covid.

What happens to the title of Duke of Edinburgh?

The title “Duke of Edinburgh” appears set to pass to Philip’s youngest son, Edward, the Earl of Wessex, who is the only child of the reigning monarch not to hold a dukedom.

But the matter is not quite so simple.

Charles, as the eldest of the siblings and heir to the throne, could have been set to inherit the title. But in 1999, Buckingham palace announced that Edward would one day take it.

Story continues below advertisement

Edward is unlikely to receive the title until after the queen’s death, when Prince Charles becomes King. When a royal becomes a monarch, other titles they hold merge with the crown, leaving room for them to be regranted.

For now, the health of Elizabeth remains of greatest consequence for Windsor Castle. When she passes away, 72-year-old Charles will take the reins.

Prince Philip retired from royal duties in 2017. The years since have been trying for Britain’s monarchs, particularly following the family’s rift with Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.

What were some of Philip’s public controversies?

While Britain’s queen focused on duties at home, Philip was often sent to tour abroad, including on trips to the 16 countries that remain part of Britain’s commonwealth.

Though many of his public appearances were well received, over the years he also made a number of memorable, insensitive comments, often exhibiting little remorse afterward.

In 1986, for example, on a tour of Beijing, he called the city “ghastly” and told a British student he might end up “slitty-eyed.” He later said it was a misquoted joke, and that he had really said “slit-eyed.”

Other apparent attempts at jokes were also poorly received. He once remarked to a female solicitor (or lawyer), “I thought it was against the law these days for a woman to solicit.” In another case he told a blind woman accompanied by a guide dog, “Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?”

Philip reportedly asked a driving instructor in Scotland, “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?”

In 2019, at age 97, the prince surrendered his license after he crashed his SUV into a car carrying three others, among them a 9-month-old.

The queen was reportedly a fan of much of his humor — though also tested by it.

“You can take it from me, that the queen has the quality of tolerance in abundance,” he said in a speech once. Elizabeth reportedly replied with a slight smile.",0

The death notice was removed, and police on horses and palace stewards told the people to go home.

The palace said Philip “passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle,” where the queen and her husband spent much of the coronavirus pandemic, mostly out of sight.

No cause of death was given. Philip had been released from a London hospital March 16, after spending a month undergoing treatment for an infection and recovering from heart surgery. The palace said at the time that his illness was not related to the coronavirus, but it did not offer any other information. Both the queen and Philip received coronavirus vaccinations in January.

Details of “modified funeral and ceremonial arrangements” — a long-planned affair known by the code name Operation Forth Bridge — would be revealed in “due course” and respect government advice on social distancing, the palace said Friday.

But how to stage a funeral for a prince in a country that has lost 150,000 this year from the virus, whose own families were stopped from gathering?

Royal births, deaths, birthdays, anniversaries and weddings are usually semipublic affairs, with the royal family — and their emotions — on display. It is part of the performance art of maintaining a modern monarchy of kings, queens and lines of succession in the 21st century.

But Philip’s funeral will not follow tradition. There will be no lying-in-state in an abbey or ceremonial hall. No public cortege, no military processions.

British royal correspondents reported that the funeral will probably take place in a week or so at St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, were wed. Philip will be interred in the family vault beneath the chapel.

Nonessential shops, outdoor pubs and hair salons are slated to open in Britain on Monday, but funeral attendance is limited to 30 people.

By comparison, at least 42 people from the extended royal family appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony for the queen’s birthday in June 2019. Philip and Elizabeth have four children, eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

There was much speculation about whether Harry, Philip’s grandson, would fly in from California for the funeral — a potentially first trip to Britain since Harry and Meghan aired their grievances with the royal family in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

On Friday, the mourning was mostly virtual — on social media. “With the safety and wellbeing of the public in mind, and in accordance with government guidelines, members of the public are asked not to gather in crowds,” the palace said in a statement. “Those wishing to express their condolences are asked to do so in the safest way possible, and not to gather at Royal Residences.”

Instead, the royal family encouraged people to make charitable donations and leave messages in a book of condolences posted on its official website.

Alongside the queen, 94, Philip had been the face of the monarchy since the couple married in 1947, before the age of television and five years before his wife ascended to the throne.

Younger generations have been introduced to the prince via the hit Netflix series “The Crown,” which presents Philip as a steadfast companion to Elizabeth through triumph and the many trials that have beset the House of Windsor.

Royal biographers say the television series is more or less accurate in its broad-brush portrait of Philip, who could be a distant, demanding father and a royal snob, who sometimes bristled behind the scenes at his role of forever yielding to the decrees of his wife and queen.

But he did his duty. He supported the institution to the very end.

At the coronation of Elizabeth at Westminster Abbey in 1953, the duke knelt before the sitting queen and pledged to be her “liegeman,” or faithful servant, for life. The couple were married for 73 years. They first met when he was 17 years old and she 13 — both of them great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.

News of his death saturated the press in Britain, as tributes began to pour forth.

From 10 Downing St., British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement that the prince had “helped to steer the Royal Family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life.”

Johnson echoed the words of Elizabeth on the couple’s golden wedding anniversary. “Her Majesty said that our country owed her husband ‘a greater debt than he would ever claim or we shall ever know’ and I am sure that estimate is correct,” he said.

President Biden joined the world leaders offering condolences to the royal family, commending Philip as “a heck of a guy.”

“Ninety-nine years old and never slowed down at all, which I admire the devil out of,” said Biden, 78.

The prince cut a dashing figure, a lean, handsome and athletic sportsman in impeccably tailored suits and military uniforms. He was a competitive cricketer and played polo into his 50s, when arthritis sidelined him. He then took up horse carriage racing instead. He was a pilot with 5,000 hours of flight time.

In recent decades, polling data showed the prince as widely respected, sometimes admired, but not tremendously popular. He was not beloved by the public — not like the queen, anyway, who remains one of the most popular figures in Britain.

Philip was famous for his quips, his zingers and his gaffes, often derogatory. To the Paraguayan despot Alfredo Stroessner in 1963, the prince said, “It’s a pleasure to be in a country that isn’t ruled by its people.” While touring China in 1986, Philip described parts of Beijing as “ghastly” and joked with a British student that he would end up “slitty eyed” if he stayed too long. During a visit to Scotland in 1995, he asked a driving instructor: “How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?”

Philip retired from his long career as a senior working royal in 2017, at age 96. At a reception with the queen, when a guest told him that he was sorry to hear the duke was standing down, Philip uttered one of his trademark quips: “Well, I can’t stand up much!”

At his retirement, Buckingham Palace couriers reported that the duke had performed 22,191 solo engagements, completed 637 overseas visits and given 5,493 speeches. He was colonel-in-chief of eight military regiments and patron of 20 cricket societies.

In all, he was a patron with 800 organizations during his long life, including the World Wildlife Fund, British Heart Association and the International Equestrian Federation.

Valentine Low, a royal correspondent for the Times of London, wrote that “wherever he got involved, he made his presence felt. His frankness could border on rudeness, and he got people’s hackles up on too many occasions to count. But he motivated people, he got results and, as his biographer John Parker noted, at the end of the day those who had suffered the rough edge of his tongue ‘regardless of any abuse he may have handed them . . . all turned round and said what a nice chap he was.’ ”",0
13,Live updates House Ethics panel opens investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz as he faces sex-trafficking allegation,"Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) has brought on two veteran New York defense attorneys, including one with close ties to former president Donald Trump, to represent him as he faces a federal investigation of possible sex trafficking of a minor, a Gaetz spokeswoman said Friday.

Marc Mukasey, a former federal prosecutor and the son of former attorney general Michael Mukasey, and Isabelle Kirshner, a longtime criminal-defense attorney and former assistant district attorney, will lead Gaetz’s legal team, said the spokeswoman, Erin Elmore.

She said in a statement that Gaetz planned to wage an aggressive battle against potential charges. “Matt has always been a fighter. A fighter for his constituents, a fighter for the country, and a fighter for the Constitution,” Elmore said. “And he’s going to fight back against the unfounded allegations against him. His legal team, led by Marc Mukasey and Isabelle Kirshner, will take the fight to those trying to smear his name with falsehoods.”

The Justice Department has been investigating a wide range of allegations surrounding Gaetz, including that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl and paid for sex in such a way that might violate federal trafficking laws. Gaetz has denied ever having sex with a 17-year-old as an adult or paying for sex.

The probe of Gaetz grew out of a Justice Department investigation of a different Florida politician: former Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg, who is facing a 33-count indictment that includes an allegation of sex trafficking of a minor. Investigators believe he and Gaetz might have had sex with the same 17-year-old, people familiar with the matter have said. In an ominous sign for Gaetz on Thursday, a prosecutor and Greenberg’s defense attorney revealed that Greenberg is likely to plead guilty in the case. If he did and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, he might be able to help prosecutors build a case against Gaetz, a higher-profile target, though Greenberg is likely to face questions about his credibility.",0
16,"Biden seeks huge funding increases for education, health care and environmental protection in first budget request to Congress","Many of the programs Biden seeks to fund at higher levels starting in October are initiatives that President Donald Trump had unsuccessfully tried to slash while in the White House. In a further break with Trump, who labored to spend sizable sums on defense during his term, Biden’s new plan calls for a less than 2 percent increase for the military in the upcoming fiscal year.

But the administration’s approach quickly divided lawmakers from both parties. Senior Senate Republicans accused the president of trying to shortchange the Pentagon, alleging that this would put the country at a disadvantage against China. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and other liberals demanded deep cuts to the military’s budget, though they endorsed the domestic investments that Biden put forward.

The mixed reception illustrates the balancing act Biden faces as he tries to navigate a Washington budget process that remains unsettled in the aftermath of the Trump administration. Democrats notched numerous spending victories during Trump’s presidency because Republicans kept capitulating on demands for spending controls. Biden, Republicans and congressional liberals are all expected to test one another again in the coming months as they debate the budget plan.

Under Biden’s proposal, the Education Department would see a roughly 41 percent increase over its current allocation, reaching $102 billion next fiscal year, with most of the new funds targeted for the Title I program, which funds high-poverty schools. The proposal would double federal spending on Title I — the largest increase since the program was created more than 55 years ago.

The plan also proposes a roughly 23 percent boost to the Department of Health and Human Services, including more than $8.7 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which the administration says is the highest funding level for the public health agency in two decades. It would further create a new federal agency under the National Institutes of Health, called the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, focused initially on innovative research on cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Biden long has had an intense interest in cancer, and translating basic scientific discoveries into cures for patients, particularly after the death of his son, Beau, from a glioblastoma in 2015.

The budget envisions putting nearly $69 billion in federal money toward addressing public housing, a 15 percent increase from the amounts enacted in 2021, to help low-income families obtain affordable accommodations. And the Biden administration hopes to set aside a total of $14 billion in new sums across the government to protect the environment, including efforts to reduce carbon emissions and research clean-energy technology.

“Together, America has a chance not simply to go back to the way things were before the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn struck, but to begin building a better, stronger, more secure, more inclusive America,” the White House’s acting budget chief, Shalanda Young, said in a letter accompanying the blueprint Friday.

In releasing the spending document, the White House set off what is an annual, often bitterly partisan fight in Washington, as lawmakers race to fund the government before the current spending agreement expires at the end of September. The vast increases Biden seeks come in addition to the $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package that he signed into law last month and the roughly $2 trillion plan to upgrade the nation’s roads, bridges and other infrastructure that the White House asked Congress to adopt last week. In total, the budget would lift all federal discretionary spending by roughly 8 percent in 2022.

President Biden said on April 7 that he is open to compromising with Republicans on his proposed $2 trillion infrastructure plan. (The Washington Post)

But setting federal spending at such high levels may prove difficult for Democrats, who maintain only narrow majorities in the House and Senate. They will probably have to rely on Republicans, who maintain filibuster power in the Senate, to fund the government. And some GOP lawmakers already have shown a renewed interest in tightening the federal purse strings — and addressing the budget deficit — after largely ignoring the issue during Trump’s presidency.

On Friday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) joined a group of fellow Republicans to lay down an apparent early marker over Biden’s proposal for the military. The spending request seeks to allot roughly $715 billion in defense spending in the next fiscal year, far less than the 3 to 5 percent annual increase that some Republicans say is necessary to keep the U.S. military apace with emerging threats, including China.

“To keep America strong, we must balance domestic and defense spending priorities,” McConnell said in a joint statement with GOP Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.), James M. Inhofe (Okla.), Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and Richard C. Shelby (Ala.), who oversee key congressional committees on spending and national security.

“President Biden has said much about reaching across the aisle,” they continued. “Both parties should be able to agree that we must maintain America’s edge over China. We urge President Biden to work with us in a bipartisan manner to ensure that.”

Anticipating the fight ahead, a senior administration official on Friday acknowledged that this is only “the beginning of a long appropriations process” on Capitol Hill. But the aide, who briefed reporters on the budget before its release on the condition of anonymity, said the document for now serves as a “great marker” of the White House’s priorities — and its belief that the country in recent years has underinvested in domestic agencies and programs.

For the past decade, Democratic and Republican presidents alike have been beholden to spending caps as a result of a budget-balancing law Congress adopted in 2011. That has taken its greatest toll on domestic agencies, limiting federal spending across government even as defense funding has continued to rise. But those caps expire entering the 2022 fiscal year, allowing Biden broad latitude to seek major increases in areas including education, commerce, energy and health.

“With austerity caps and an era of chronic disinvestment finally behind us, Congress can turn this proposal into a budget that will help generate a stronger, fairer economy, while truly meeting the needs of our communities,” Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.), the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said in a statement.

Under Biden’s blueprint, the country would spend $769 billion on nondefense programs. The education dollars include new boosts to Pell Grants, which offer support to low-income college students, though the $400 annual increase the president has proposed is smaller than the amount he initially endorsed on the campaign trail. The budget proposal would also expand government-supported child-care programs and add money to hire more counselors and mental health professionals at schools.

Other new funding is slated for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which would see a major expansion of voucher programs that might help more than 200,000 families, the administration estimates. And the budget aims to boost climate-change-focused programs, including the Environmental Protection Agency. Aiming to reverse massive cuts at the EPA over the past decade, the Biden administration has requested a roughly 21 percent increase in its funding, which would support a new, $936 million “environmental justice initiative” that promises to “hold polluters accountable.”

Some of the budget proposals seek to expand initiatives enacted under the $1.9 trillion stimulus, the American Rescue Plan, which Biden signed into law last month. They include new money to help homeless families and veterans, and new funding for public health programs targeting racial and ethnic minorities. The budget also proposes roughly $100 million to aid states so they can further improve their unemployment benefits systems in the wake of crushing demand earlier in the pandemic.

Other proposed increases track long-held Democratic policy priorities. There’s more money proposed for police reform and changes to the criminal justice system, for example, and new investments — totaling $2.1 billion — to try to combat gun violence. And the Biden administration has recommended a significant increase in funding to fight the opioid epidemic, hoping to devote $10.7 billion to the cause next fiscal year.

Republicans sharply blasted the budget proposal Friday. Rep. Jason T. Smith (Mo.), the top GOP lawmaker on the House Budget Committee, criticized the Biden administration for producing what he said amounted to a “back-of-the-envelope booking exercise” weeks late. For its part, the White House faced early obstacles in preparing its spending request because of delays created by the outgoing Trump administration as it sought to cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 election. Adding to the trouble, Biden’s initial pick to lead his top budget office, Neera Tanden, ultimately had to withdraw from consideration after some of her tweets drew political blowback.

Biden’s budget marks a dramatic shift in approach compared with Trump, under whom federal spending largely stayed flat until Congress was forced to authorize sweeping new aid in 2020 amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. The gap between government spending and revenue grew to more than $3.1 trillion in 2020 after running above $1 trillion for several years.

To finance these deficits, the Treasury Department issues debt to borrow money. Federal Reserve officials and others encouraged the White House to borrow money last year to help the recovery and because interest rates were low, but the government must still pay interest on large borrowing levels. Last year, total government debt eclipsed the entire size of the American economy — and over the four years of Trump’s presidency it grew from about $14 trillion to more than $21 trillion.

During his less than three months in office, Biden has not shown any inclination to pivot toward austerity. He has already signed the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, proposed more than $2 trillion in infrastructure spending and then called for new domestic spending as part of his budget plan Friday.

Biden’s budget proposal does not include new ideas for changing the tax code. Earlier in the week, the Treasury Department unveiled a $2.5 trillion plan to raise corporate taxes to finance infrastructure changes, but the president has not specified whether he will seek further changes to the tax code to offset other areas of new spending.",0
17,What is in the Biden 2022 budget?,"The White House proposal released Friday now goes to Congress, which ultimately holds the purse strings. Democrats hold narrow majorities in the House and Senate and will likely rely on Republicans to get the budget through, especially as Democrats vie for a massive jobs and infrastructure plan on top of Biden’s recent coronavirus stimulus bill.

Story continues below advertisement

But no matter how Congress recalibrates the request, Biden’s initial swing stands in stark contrast to Trump’s spending goals. Trump’s budget proposals were often ignored by Congress, but they did serve as a marker of his priorities. He mostly sought to slash programs he alleged were examples of bloated government waste. Biden’s budget frames the government in a much different light.

His proposal, for example, includes almost $103 billion for the Education Department, a massive 41 percent increase over the 2021 enacted level.

The White House proposal would bolster the Title I program, which serves high-poverty schools, doubling funding. It falls short of Biden’s campaign promise to triple funding, but would still easily represent the largest increase in the program’s history and comes on top of a huge infusion of funds to these schools through the rescue act. The plan also targets students’ physical and mental well-being by increasing the federal support for counselors, nurses and mental health professionals in schools. And the request would increase funding for special education and related services for students with disabilities, taking a small step toward Biden’s campaign goal of fully funding the longtime unfulfilled federal commitment for special education.

For higher education, Biden’s proposal invests an additional $3 billion in Pell Grants, allowing an increase of $400 to the maximum grant, now set at $6,345. That falls well short of his promise to double Pell Grants, though more funding could be coming when the White House releases its complete budget plan. He called for Dreamers, young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children, to become eligible for Pell Grants, a policy change Congress would need to endorse. The proposal also seeks to boost funding for historically Black colleges and universities, tribally controlled colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions.

By comparison, Trump’s budget proposal for 2021 sought to cut education funding by $5.6 billion, or roughly 8 percent. Trump’s final plan while in office sought steep cuts to the student loan program intended to slash popular initiatives like a loan forgiveness program for students who take public service jobs, and subsidized lending for low-income students. In terms of spending increases, Trump’s proposal put a new $5 billion tax credit to reward donors who contribute to private school scholarships.

On health-care spending, Biden’s proposal would ramp up funding for the Department of Health and Human Services to $131.7 billion, a 23.5 percent increase from the 2021 enacted level.

Advertisement

That would include $8.7 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up $1.6 billion over the 2021 enacted level and the largest budget authority increase for the CDC in nearly 20 years. The request also includes $905 million for the Strategic National Stockpile to replenish critical medical supplies and other needs amid the pandemic.

Beyond coronavirus, the proposal would put $10.7 billion to combat the opioid crisis, and $670 million to fight the country’s HIV/AIDS epidemic. It also increases appropriations for mental health services and block grants and expands suicide-prevention activities. The proposal also spans a number of other health-based initiatives, including addressing racial disparities in health care, reducing the maternal mortality rate and increasing funding for domestic violence hotlines and medical support.

Trump’s 2021 budget proposal sought to cut HHS discretionary spending by 9 percent. The proposal sought to eliminate Community Development Block Grants, low-income energy assistance and certain training programs for health professionals — efforts which had long been part of a conservative push.

Under Trump’s proposal in February 2020, the budget for the CDC would have been reduced by almost 16 percent. At the time, HHS officials proposed refocusing the CDC on its core mission of preventing and controlling infectious diseases and other public health crises, such as opioid addiction, while cutting funding for non-infectious-disease activities.

Adding to Biden’s broader push for a greener economic and climate policy, the administration’s budget proposal would hike funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by 21.3 percent from the 2021 enacted level. The proposal spans efforts to restaff the EPA — which lost nearly 1,000 workers over the past four years — and investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Building on Biden’s jobs and infrastructure proposal, the budget request includes funding for community water systems, repairs for septic systems and cleaning up contaminated land.

Advertisement

In contrast, Trump sought deep cuts at the EPA and put forward a 2021 budget that would decrease funding by 26 percent from 2020 enacted levels. The White House zeroed in on what it called “50 wasteful programs that are outside of EPA’s core missions or duplicative of other efforts” as part of a widespread push to reverse many of the environmental protections put in place during the Obama administration.

And in another split, the Biden administration is seeking to increase funding for the Department of Commerce by 28 percent from the 2021 enacted level. Trump’s 2021 proposal sought to slash Commerce’s budget by 37 percent — 10 percent more than any other department — largely due to the decrease in spending on the U.S. Census.

The Trump years were also marked by dramatic attempts to increase military spending. Trump’s proposed 2021 budget gave a roughly 13 percent boost to the Department of Veterans Affairs. It also sought to increase overall spending to the Department of Homeland Security by 3.2 percent and would have increased NASA’s budget by $2.7 billion, putting $700 million to support lunar activities.

Now, Biden is proposing a 1.7 percent increase in funding for national defense programs — much smaller than the administration’s other pushes for education, climate and health. Funding for DHS would stay roughly equal to the 2021 enacted level. Investments in the Department of Veterans Affairs would go up 8.2 percent, and funding for NASA 6.3 percent.",0

“We’re not going anywhere,” Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, said during a union news conference after the vote count. ""Whether Jeff Bezos likes it or not, this organizing drive is going to open the floodgates to more collective action.”

The union that sought to represent the Bessemer workers, the Retail Warehouse and Department Store Union, said it will challenge the results, claiming Amazon used tactics to mislead and intimidate workers that were illegal.

""They lied and tried to game the system,“ RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum said.

Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener rebutted those claims.

“These fabrications are tiresome but expected,” Herdener said in a statement. “You’re going to hear a lot of untruths from the union now because they have to explain the lopsided result and their answer can’t be Amazon pays more than $15 an hour, offers health care from day one, up to 20 weeks of parental leave, and a safe, clean work environment in state-of-the-art fulfillment centers.”

The unionization effort in Bessemer quickly mushroomed over the past few months into one of the most closely watched labor battles in recent history after workers filed their notice to hold a unionization vote last November. In the following months, Amazon barraged the 5,805 workers eligible to vote with text messages and fliers posted on doors inside bathroom stalls.

Amazon set up an anti-union website — the now defunct DoItWithoutDues.com — to discourage workers from joining the union drive. And before the voting period, it held mandatory meetings for workers on company time, called captive-audience sessions, to show videos and run through PowerPoint presentations that disparage unionization.

Meanwhile, the union stationed organizers outside the warehouse to answer questions and hand out leaflets to workers as their shifts ended. It held rallies in Bessemer with politicians such as Sanders and actors including Danny Glover to stoke enthusiasm for the drive.

Votes tallied Friday against unionization totaled 1,798 of the more than 3,000 total votes cast, while 738 voted for the union. The margin of victory is larger than the 505 challenged ballots, which would have been counted only if they could have determined the outcome. The labor board voided 76 ballots for a variety of reasons.

The union drive inspired workers at other Amazon facilities to consider their own organizing efforts. More than 1,000 workers have contacted the RWDSU to find out what it might take to launch campaigns at their facilities. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters recently approached 400 to 500 workers at Amazon facilities in Iowa to organize.

Organizers for the GMB Union in the United Kingdom, too, have been keeping an eye on Bessemer as it targets two warehouses there for possible organizing drives.

National Labor Relations Board rules give the union and the company five business days to file objections contesting the conduct or results of the election. The RWDSU plans to file unfair labor practices claims that, if successful, could lead the labor board to toss out the election results. If the board chose to hear the union’s claims, it will need to schedule hearings for that.

It’s unclear whether the union will succeed in winning a challenge. If it did, the entire election process could start again. The RWDSU could also pursue legal challenges in court.

Among the multiple charges the union intends to file with the NLRB are claims about a generic U.S. Postal Service mailbox that popped up in front of the warehouse just after voting started.

The union has complained about the mailbox, arguing it could lead workers to think Amazon has some role in collecting and counting ballots, potentially influencing their votes.

The Post reported Thursday on emails, obtained by the union through Freedom of Information Act requests, that show Amazon pressing the Postal Service to install a mailbox urgently just as the seven-week mail-in balloting began.

The union also complained about a financial offer Amazon made to lure unhappy workers to quit, arguing that the company provided an improper incentive to weed out pro-union workers.

Amazon has said the mailbox provides a convenient way for workers to vote, and the pay-to-quit offer is extended annually to warehouse workers across the country.

“It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,” Amazon said in a blog post. “Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us. And Amazon didn’t win — our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union.”

Throughout the union drive, the company noted that its Bessemer workers earn a starting pay of $15.30 an hour, well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. (Alabama has no state minimum-wage law.) And the company added that pay, along with health-care, vision and dental benefits and a retirement plan, offer employees more than comparable jobs provide.

Amazon’s opposition to unionization, though, had more to do with concerns over potential workplace rules that could have limited its ability to rapidly hire and cut workers to meet shopping demands that spike and recede throughout the year, former company executives have told The Washington Post.

Amazon‘s efforts to persuade workers demonstrates the difficulty unions face in organizing drives, said Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers University. She called the union loss “lopsided, but not surprising.”

“It’s really, really hard to win an organizing drive,” Givan said. “The employer has almost unlimited resources and the ability to bombard workers with messages of fear and uncertainty.”

Will Stokes, an employee at the warehouse, said in a news conference held by Amazon that the company’s campaign against the union presented information fairly. He said he decided to speak out against the union because he thought conditions at the warehouse were being inaccurately represented in news articles. He said most of the misinformation was coming from the union.

“Amazon is not perfect, there are flaws, but we are committed to correcting those flaws,"" Stokes said. “We just feel like we can do it without a union. Why pay a union to do something we can do ourselves?”

The election process also evolved into a reflection of the times. Rather than voting in person at ballot boxes, as is typical of union balloting, workers voted by mail over a seven-week period, a decision by the NLRB to protect Amazon workers and its staff from contracting the coronavirus. Although some workers supported unionization over concerns about a brutal pace of work, the RWDSU also framed the fight around issues of respect and dignity, saying the battle is as much a civil rights struggle as a labor one.

While many of Amazon’s European warehouse workers are organized, the company has faced only one other union vote in the United States. In 2014, a small group of equipment maintenance and repair technicians at its warehouse in Middletown, Del., ultimately voted against forming a union, following a drive led by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

The union’s Appelbaum expressed no regret for the campaign, even with the lopsided vote.

“I think the timing of the election was right,"" Appelbaum said. “I think there’s a moment in American life right now that this campaign captured. What we have seen is the revulsion to the extraordinary inequality in our society personified by the staggering personal wealth of Jeff Bezos.”

A pro-union worker at the warehouse, Emmit Ashford, said at the union news conference that the fight against Amazon will continue.",0
19,The winners and losers of Amazon’s warehouse union vote,"While the vote tally was a decisive victory for Amazon, it is not the end for workers who want to form unions, at Amazon or at other companies across the United States. There were some clear winners and losers Friday, but it was just one moment in a continuing history of workers facing off against better-funded companies for the right to form unions and improve their working conditions.

Plus, the Retail, Warehouse and Department Store Union (RWDSU) said it will challenge the fairness of the results, which could prompt a reexamination of the vote.

Here is where the parties stand after this week’s vote:

Amazon

The vote tally, 1,798 to 738, represents a decisive margin of victory for Amazon, which sank money and resources into this fight. Though the final numbers could change, it’s likely the company’s executives can pause and take a breath — and feel emboldened going into any future attempts by workers to unionize. Amazon is the second-largest private employer in the United States after Walmart.

“Amazon didn’t win — our employees made the choice to vote against joining a union,” Amazon said in a blog post about the results.

Warehouse workers

For the 5,800 employees who would have been part of the union’s bargaining unit at this one Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, this vote could be the end of the road for now. The pro-union workers lost, and it looks unlikely they’ll be able to hold any similar kind of vote again soon, according to Andrew M. MacDonald, a partner at Fox Rothschild who specializes in labor law and union issues.

The RWDSU said Friday it plans to file multiple charges of labor violations with the National Labor Relations Board.

While it is illegal to retaliate against workers for trying to unionize, there could still be fear among employees that they could face punishment from Amazon or managers or a hope that the attempt shook the company enough for it to alter how it pays or treat employees. MacDonald said neither is very likely.

Story continues below advertisement

“I don’t think Amazon really has any motivation to go out and retaliate right now. The connection would be pretty blatant if they did,” MacDonald said. “Coming out of this election, the employees selected Amazon over the union. Instead of retaliation, Amazon is going to see this as a vindication of their employment practices.”

The U.S. labor movement

While this vote is a setback for all warehouse workers who may be hoping to unionize, it’s not the end for the larger movement.

“They made it to a vote,” said Lynne Vincent, assistant professor of management at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management. “That means there’s momentum behind this movement and there is discontent among their workers, and now that discontent has been amplified to a national level, where they are getting support from large unions.”

The vote has fed into an already growing public conversation around unionization, especially at technology companies. In recent years, there have been calls to unionize at Google and a worldwide walkout. Gig companies such as Uber and Lyft have faced questions about their classifications of workers as contractors and their ability to unionize. But there hasn’t been any decisive win in favor of technology workers.

Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, said during a union news conference that the Amazon campaign will “open the floodgates” of union action.

“We’re not going anywhere,” Trumka said.

Politicians

This push had some very high-level, vocal supporters, including President Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Biden last month tweeted a video in support of workers being able to push for unionization without intimidation from their employers, though he did not mention Amazon by name. The cause even had some Republican backing: Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said he supported the workers’ attempts to organize. A loss seems unlikely to change politicians’ support for unions going forward, but fewer high-profile attempts to unionize could mean fewer occasions to address the issue so publicly.

Big Tech

Tech workers for companies such as Google have pushed for unionization in recent years, with a few hundred employees even forming an atypical union that isn’t ratified by a federal agency. Tech companies that rely on gig workers are also facing attempts to organize.

Some of the most vocal tech workers have been white-collar employees, whose situations differ significantly from warehouse workers’. But there is something Uber drivers, Google programmers and Amazon warehouse workers have in common: They’re going up against well-funded tech companies. Watching the Alabama vote has been a way to see what kind of tactics these kinds of companies are willing and able to deploy to discourage workers from voting for a union.

“Even if the workers are doing dissimilar work, it’s a similar type of large company that has the same types of resources,” Vincent said. “One of the key issues is the massive amounts of resources that these firms have. So whether we’re looking at Amazon or tech companies, they’re going to have those resources, and it’s about maneuvering around those resources to get a pro-union message to employees.”

Other businesses

It’s not just tech companies taking their cues from Friday’s results. Other businesses with warehouse workers — such as retailers — were also probably watching closely, fearing a ripple effect.

“All employers of all kinds of sizes and all industries were watching this vote. It seemed to capture a lot more attention than even some past high-profile union elections,” MacDonald said. “It’s the change in administration, the pandemic, the fact that this vote involved employees that have become essential workers that many people depend on and send them everyday items, and just a general increase in awareness in economic and working issues.”

Walmart has 1.5 million U.S. workers — more than Amazon — none of whom are unionized. In 2000, butchers at a Texas Walmart store won union recognition for the first time. Weeks later, the company eliminated its butcher counters across the United States.",0
20,"DMX, chart-topping rapper with gruff voice and hardscrabble life, dies at 50","His family announced the death in a statement. His lawyer, Murray Richman, told The Washington Post on Sunday that DMX had been hospitalized after a heart attack. He said he had no knowledge that DMX had suffered a drug overdose, as reported by TMZ.

DMX, whose real name was Earl Simmons, recorded with artists including LL Cool J and Onyx before releasing his debut album, “It’s Dark and Hell Is Hot,” in 1998. Featuring singles such as “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem” and “Get at Me Dog” — “I’m just robbin’ to eat / And there’s at least a thousand of us like me mobbin’ the street” — the album sold more than 4 million copies and established him as a leader of hardcore hip-hop.

Fans of rapper DMX held a prayer vigil on April 5 outside a suburban New York hospital. The rapper died on April 9 at age 50. (Reuters)

Hailed by some critics as an heir to slain rapper Tupac Shakur, DMX delivered rhymes in a growl, punctuated his songs with doglike barks and often rapped about his impoverished upbringing in Yonkers, N.Y., where he said he was first given crack cocaine at age 14, sold mix tapes on the street, and bounced between group homes and juvenile detention centers.

“Even more than Eminem (who balances his paranoia with a mischievous sense of humor) or Tupac Shakur (who balanced his laments with smooth, swaggering boasts), DMX makes it impossible for listeners to ignore his suffering and desperation,” music critic Kelefa Sanneh wrote in a 2006 article for the New York Times. Rolling Stone declared that his voice was “the sound of gravel hitting the grave.”

DMX later toured with rappers Jay-Z, Method Man and Redman and became something of a hip-hop rock star, performing before a crowd of 200,000 at Woodstock ’99 and releasing the crossover single “Party Up (Up in Here)” the next year: “Y’all gon’ make me lose my mind / Up in here, up in here.” He became the first artist in the history of the Billboard 200 to reach No. 1 with each of his first five albums.

He also moved into acting, appearing in three Andrzej Bartkowiak blockbusters that fused martial arts and hip-hop. After a small role as a nightclub owner in “Romeo Must Die” (2000), he starred as a drug-dealing computer expert in “Exit Wounds” (2001), opposite Steven Seagal, and played a jewel thief who partners with Jet Li’s Taiwanese detective in “Cradle 2 the Grave” (2003).

But his music and film careers were increasingly overshadowed by his legal troubles, including charges of animal cruelty, drug possession and impersonating a federal agent in a bizarre attempt to steal a car. According to a 2019 article in GQ, he went to jail some 30 times. By the time he filed for bankruptcy in 2013, he had 10 children (he later had five more, according to news reports) and owed $1.3 million in child support payments.

In an interview that year with motivational speaker and author Iyanla Vanzant, he traced some of his difficulties to a crack cocaine addiction that made him feel paranoid and suicidal. “Just because you stop getting high doesn’t mean that you don’t have a problem, because it’s a constant fight every day,” he said. “Every trigger that was a trigger is still a trigger. Whether you act on it or not is something different. But I will always, until I die, I will always have a drug problem.”

In 2017, he was charged with concealing millions of dollars in income and dodging $1.7 million in taxes. He pleaded guilty to tax fraud and was sentenced to a year in prison after Richman, his lawyer, played a recording of DMX’s song “Slippin’ ” for the Federal District Court in Manhattan, trying to convey a sense of the rapper’s life and music. “They put me in a situation forcin’ me to be a man,” he rapped, “when I was just learnin’ to stand without a helpin’ hand.”

According to a report in the Times, Judge Jed. S Rakoff appeared unmoved but later expressed sympathy for DMX. “In the court’s view Mr. Simmons is a good man, a very far from perfect man,” he said, rejecting prosecutors’ recommendation for a five-year sentence. “In many ways he is, to give the cliche, his own worst enemy.”

Earl Simmons was born Dec. 18, 1970, with various accounts giving his birthplace as Baltimore or Mount Vernon, N.Y. In his telling, he was raised by a single mother who once knocked out two of his teeth with a broom.

He was institutionalized from ages 7 to 14 and said he was arrested for the first time when he was 10, for arson. In Yonkers, he befriended stray dogs and started beatboxing for a local rapper named Ready Ron, who encouraged him to write his own rhymes but also introduced him to crack cocaine. “Everything in my life is blessed with a curse,” DMX said last year in an interview with fellow rapper Talib Kweli.

By 1992, when he signed with Columbia Records, he was using the name Dark Man X or DMX, after a digital drum machine. His first single, “Born Loser,” lived up to its title; he struggled to break through before switching to Ruff Ryders/Def Jam Records, which released his 1998 debut album. Later that year he released a follow-up, “Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood,” with a cover photo that appeared to show him covered with blood.

“I want to say what’s on my people’s minds, soak up all their pain,” he told a Def Jam interviewer. “I’ve learned that when I take it all in, I can make one brotha’s pain be understood by the world.”

Shortly before going on tour in 1998, he was charged with raping a woman he had allegedly met at a strip club. He was later cleared by a DNA test and went on to make his feature-film debut later that year, starring alongside the rapper Nas in “Belly,” a crime film made by music-video director Hype Williams.

His later films included “Never Die Alone” (2004), in which he played a hardened drug dealer named King David. The movie earned only $6 million but drew praise from critics such as Roger Ebert, who wrote that it was “not a routine story of drugs and violence, but an ambitious, introspective movie in which a heartless man tells his story without apology.”

DMX starred in a reality television series on BET, “DMX: Soul of a Man” (2006), and started his own record label, Bloodline. He received three Grammy nominations, including for best rap album with “. . . And Then There Was X” (1999).

His marriage to Tashera Simmons ended in divorce. He was engaged to Desiree Lindstrom, but complete information on survivors was not immediately available.

After serving his prison sentence for tax fraud, DMX delivered a prayer at Kanye West’s weekly, concertlike Sunday Service ceremony. He often cited his Christian faith as a source of strength, telling GQ that he prayed before taking the stage and then again before leaving it. Performing, he said, offered a physical and emotional high that no drug could match.

Though some of his most iconic songs are definitive party anthems — namely the Grammy-nominated 1999 single “Party Up (Up In Here)” — the rapper built a soul-baring discography that referenced his persistent legal troubles and alluded to his painful childhood in Yonkers, N.Y. In his 2003 memoir, “E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX,” the rapper recalled that his father was almost nonexistent in his life, and he alleged that he was regularly abused by his mother. Amid his hardcore lyrics, his songs and interludes often took on spiritual themes.

On Friday, producer Swizz Beatz, a longtime collaborator who produced “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem,"" “Party Up” and other DMX hits, shared a video of the rapper gruffly singing “Fame,” the theme song popularized by Irene Cara: “I’m gonna make it to heaven, light up the sky like a flame.”

“I’m truly beyond devastated,” Swizz wrote in an Instagram post. “But I’m so happy my brother is no longer in pain. I watched him take everyone’s pain and make it his own.”

DMX also cultivated an onscreen presence that reflected his influence in hip-hop, and stretched beyond his enduring catalogue, which continues to be used in shows and films. He starred alongside Nas in the 1998 crime drama “Belly,” and worked with Jet Li on two films — “Romeo Must Die,” which also starred Aaliyah, and “Cradle 2 the Grave.” He played himself in a beloved 2015 episode of ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat,” prompting praise from Eddie Huang, the series’ rap-loving creator, who had previously expressed distaste for the show’s story lines.

TMZ reported recently that DMX, who spoke publicly about his years-long battle with substance use, had been rushed to a hospital in White Plains, N.Y. after suffering a drug overdose. Murray Richman, the rapper’s lawyer and longtime friend, told The Washington Post he had no knowledge of the rapper suffering an overdose but confirmed that DMX was on life support after suffering a heart attack.

News of the rapper’s hospitalization had prompted an outpouring of support from fans and hip-hop stars including Missy Elliott, Funkmaster Flex, LeBron James and Chance the Rapper. DMX’s fans also held vigil outside the hospital, praying and blasting some of his well-known hits.

22,Opinion | Biden wants to boost democracy around the world. But what about the despots who are U.S. allies?,"His “crimes” stem from a peaceful pro-democracy protest movement aimed at creating genuine democracy in Thailand — a country currently ruled by a former general and a king. A mass trial of dozens of other student activists is also underway. Some of the most outspoken dissidents have disappeared — only to turn up dead, their bodies filled with concrete.

This is happening in a country that is one of the United States’ oldest and closest allies in Asia. And it’s just one example of many that showcase the challenges underlying President Biden’s bid to restore the United States’ standing as a beacon for global democracy.

Story continues below advertisement

For the past four years, President Donald Trump trampled on President Ronald Reagan’s claim that the United States should be seen as a “shining city upon a hill.” Democratic reformers in places like Thailand saw only darkness as they looked to the United States and saw Trump showering praise on dictators. The Jan. 6 insurrection also underlined the urgency of restoring functioning democracy in the United States itself.

Of course, the United States had a checkered record on democracy promotion even before Trump. Since World War II, the United States has used its power to advance the cause of democracy in countless countries. But there have also been times when the White House has helped sponsor coups that uprooted democratically elected leaders and replaced them with militaristic despots. Too often, Washington has eloquently championed democracy in speeches, while entrenching authoritarian allies through a more hard-nosed foreign policy. The distasteful mantra that “he may be a despot, but he’s our despot” applies to U.S. allies as diverse as Egypt, Uganda and, yes, Thailand.

The reasons for such authoritarian acceptance vary. Sometimes, the White House sends billions in aid and weapons to atrocious regimes, and in exchange they are supposed to play ball with U.S. counterterrorism operations (as in Uganda and Pakistan). In other cases it’s to ensure a favorable regional balance of power, or to maintain peace with another U.S. ally (as with Egypt’s recognition of Israel). But Washington also worries that any genuine pressure on friendly despots will only push them further into Beijing’s outstretched authoritarian arms. That’s one of the big worries with Thailand.

Story continues below advertisement

This is the central dilemma of U.S. democracy promotion. To truly stand up for democracy, Biden can’t afford to stand with dictators. But standing only with democratically elected leaders opens up quite a lot of the geopolitical chess board to China, which is eagerly seeking fresh pawns.

There is a solution. It’s possible to play geopolitical hardball while making the world more democratic. But it requires a fresh approach to democracy promotion that incorporates bipartisan long-term planning — a facet of U.S. foreign policy that is usually swept aside by the divisive short-termism used to win the next election.

Currently, countries like Thailand know that the State Department will occasionally issue scathing news releases, but will do little to punish the perpetrators in the regime. The United States’ allied despots mostly exist in an equilibrium. They can escape sanctions or a loss of weapons sales so long as they don’t take things too far. Poisoning critics could force Washington to take drastic action, so our dictator “friends” typically jail them instead. The same regimes hold elections but rig them. Counterfeit democracy reigns supreme. It’s what I call “the curse of low expectations.”

For Washington to change the rules of this game overnight would enable Beijing to easily pick off U.S. allies. The world’s 15-year slide toward authoritarianism would continue even faster.

The solution is for Biden and Congress to establish clear democratic benchmarks that countries must meet in the future to maintain their cozy relationship with the United States. The benchmarks should be specific, realistic and easily measurable. And there should be a mechanism to ensure the White House follows through on its own commitments.

Some measures could be abrupt. For example, Biden could establish a new policy that outlaws arms sales to any regime deemed by an independent, nongovernmental body of experts to be committing or facilitating war crimes.

Story continues below advertisement

Others will take time. It may be too much to ask an authoritarian ally to hold a legitimate, competitive election next year, but Biden could announce that they must do so before the end of his term or face reduced support from Washington. Similarly, Biden could phase in mandatory aid reductions or sanctions for governments that jail journalists or pro-democracy reformers on bogus charges. By gradually replacing hypocrisy and uncertainty with principled predictability, the United States could give awful regimes time to adapt without blasting them into China’s orbit.

23,Opinion | Abolishing the death penalty must be part of reimagining safety,"Through Charles J. Ogletree Jr. and Austin Sarat’s book “From the Lynch Mob to the Killing State” and the leadership of Bryan Stevenson’s Equal Justice Initiative, the white sheets that hid lynching’s horrors have been torn away. Stevenson has called capital punishment lynching’s “stepchild” and noted that “the states with the highest lynching rates are the states with the highest execution rates.”

Or, as one exoneree noted: “They brought the tree from outside and put it inside.”

Until recently, the death penalty has enjoyed broad public support in the United States, which has allowed public officials to quietly spend millions every year to kill a very select number of people. But the logic, values and trade-offs implicit in decisions to prosecute capital cases and pursue executions are being increasingly questioned by a public grown wise to the reality behind “tough on crime” rhetoric.

With the death penalty in retreat, and a national conversation unfolding over how overpoliced communities can better provide for their own safety, long-term abolitionists have the opportunity to do more than end an egregious and racist policy that has no place in a civilized country. They can align with those pushing for “community justice” — a future in which cities’ budgets and politics are truly responsive to the community’s evolving health and safety priorities, not stuck in the punishment-first approach of the past. Arising from “different centers of energy,” the movement to abolish the death penalty and the movement for community justice have the potential to create, in the words of Robert F. Kennedy, “a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.”

Story continues below advertisement

It has become increasingly difficult to argue that capital punishment has anything to do with either public safety or even punishment for individual wrongdoing. A decade of research laid bare claims that the death penalty is reserved for “the worst of the worst.” Rather, most death sentences are meted out to the poorest of the poor, the sickest of the sick, the blackest of the Black, and to those with long histories of abuse, trauma and mental illness and who are represented by incompetent, overworked and under-resourced counsel. We now know that fewer than 16 counties — or roughly one half of 1 percent — return five or more death sentences per year. These “death penalty counties” share at least three systemic deficiencies: a history of overzealous prosecutions, inadequate defense lawyering, and a pattern of racial bias and exclusion throughout the justice system.

How do we best allocate resources to truly keep everyone as healthy and safe as possible? When viewed from this perspective, an alliance between activists of color advancing community justice and death penalty abolitionists — whose ranks are often whiter — becomes almost inevitable. Capital punishment is more than a visceral and tragic indication of which lives matter in our society. It vividly and powerfully illustrates how scarce public resources and attention are misdirected to support “the machinery of death” instead of policies that will actually promote well-being.

Similar currents flow through neighborhoods organizing for community justice. Families for Justice as Healing surveyed the highest incarceration communities in Boston. The resulting People’s Budget differed significantly from the official one unveiled by the mayor. It prioritized safe and affordable housing, healing and treatment centers, community-led violence and gun-prevention programs, public education, parks, community centers and city infrastructure. That same gap is prominent in the movement to transform the criminal legal system. A nationwide survey by the Alliance for Safety and Justice of more than 800 victims of crime found that 60 percent “would prefer a system that dealt shorter prison sentences and invested more resources in prevention and rehabilitation programs,"" as the Urban Institute said. “This is true even among survivors of serious violent crime.”

After laying the groundwork to dismantle segregated schools, Charles Hamilton Houston, known as the lawyer who killed Jim Crow, recognized that other challenges remained. He insisted that “all of our struggles must tie in together and support one another.”

Today, we are poised to heed Houston’s insight. Death penalty abolitionists can join proponents of community justice in mobilizing White allies to advance what Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, has called an “an economy of care,” in which investments in housing, education, jobs, violence prevention, health care and civic engagement take priority over policing, prisons and prosecutions. Such a potent alliance has the opportunity to propel policymakers to think beyond tinkering with an inhumane social order. By advancing a genuine redesign of public policy and resource allocation, they can ensure that “We the People” includes all of us.

In fact, the way they want to snatch authority away from local election officials fits in with a long tradition of what’s known as “preemption” laws, in which local governments are forbidden from making their own rules in ways Republicans don’t like.

The most potentially dangerous of these measures is Georgia’s new voter suppression law. You probably know about the more colorful provisions that seem targeted at Black voters, but less attention has been paid to how the Georgia law directly targets local election officials, forbidding them from using mobile voting locations (as heavily Democratic Fulton County, where Atlanta is located, did in 2020) or accepting outside grants to run elections.

Most egregiously, the law gives the legislature — which is firmly in Republican hands despite recent statewide Democratic success there — control over the State Election Board, and allows that board, in turn, to appoint someone of its choosing to essentially take over a local election board.

Had the law been in effect in 2020, Georgia Republicans could have simply said they didn’t approve of how Fulton County did things, then installed their hand-picked representative. It isn’t hard to see, in a race as close as Georgia’s was, that all kinds of mischief could have happened.

Georgia is just the beginning:

In Texas, Republican lawmakers were angry that Harris County , where Houston is located, took steps in 2020 to make it easier to vote, including extending voting hours and planning to mail absentee ballot requests to every eligible voter. Their new voter suppression bill would forbid county officials from expanding voting hours or mailing absentee ballot requests to voters who haven’t requested them. It would also keep local officials from allocating their own resources by requiring that every polling location in a county, no matter how many voters it serves, has the same number of voting machines, which all but guarantees long wait times in dense urban districts.

A law recently passed in Iowa forbids local election officials from sending absentee ballot applications to voters who haven’t requested them, and stops local officials from setting up satellite voting locations.

In Michigan, a Republican-sponsored bill would bar local election officials from giving voters absentee ballot return envelopes with prepaid postage.

In Arizona, Republican bills would prevent local election officials from sending unrequested absentee ballot applications, and stop them from holding voter registration drives anywhere but on government property.

You might argue that both Democrats and Republicans are happy to substitute their judgment for that of local officials to get the outcomes they want. Which is true to a degree, but there are two differences. First, Democrats don’t pretend to have some abstract commitment to local control: Any liberal would say that sometimes local control works better, and sometimes it doesn’t. Republicans are the only hypocrites on that score.

But, more importantly, Republicans have been far more aggressive in reaching down to the local level to dictate how cities and counties are run.

In recent years, Republicans at the state level around the country have passed preemption laws forbidding localities from raising their minimum wage, requiring paid leave or otherwise promoting workers’ rights. They’ve moved to keep localities from passing gun laws more restrictive than Republicans would like. They’ve told cities they aren’t allowed to remove Confederate monuments without the legislature’s permission. They’ve forbidden localities from setting up municipal broadband systems, or raising taxes, or banning single-use plastic bags.

Here and there, a few Democrats may have joined in those efforts. But they’re overwhelmingly driven by Republicans, and it isn’t hard to see why.

The impulse comes from the fact that states run by Republicans always include cities run by Democrats — often among the centers of commerce and culture in the state, whether it’s Austin or Boise or Salt Lake City or St. Louis. Republicans just don’t like it when those cities make rules in line with the values of the people who live in them.

In addition, those cities are almost always more racially and ethnically diverse than the rural areas where Republicans dominate. This is one of the key political divides in America today: Democratic power residing in diverse cities while Republican power — boosted by gerrymandering and other anti-democratic features of the American system — is increasingly dependent on White rural areas, and hostile to what comes out of those cities.

The clearer that divide becomes, the more the GOP will try to reach down and determine what happens in those cities, and whether their residents will even be able to vote. In that effort, “local control” isn’t just something Republicans no longer believe in, it’s a profound threat to their power, and they’ll do whatever is necessary to quash it.

25,"Opinion | Sorry, Republicans, Georgia’s new law makes voting harder — not better","The law constricts mail-in voting. It drastically slashes the amount of time voters have to request and return absentee ballots. Voters will have to provide ID numbers as they fill them out, a new requirement that will confound some people. The law bars counties from distributing absentee ballot applications unless voters specifically request them, and third-party groups face punishment for sending applications to voters who already requested them. And it curbs mail-in ballot drop boxes so as to make them practically useless.

Story continues below advertisement

Georgia Republicans expanded absentee voting before 2020, and the state has been one of many showing that mail-in balloting is safe and reliable. But after Democrats embraced it in last year’s vote, Republicans suddenly decided to restrict it.

The law also requires election officials to trash provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct, even in statewide races, a gratuitous punishment for accidentally showing up to the wrong polling place. It bans the mobile voting buses that Atlanta’s Fulton County used in the last election to ease lines at polling places. And the law cuts in half the time for Georgia to conduct runoff elections, which threatens to end weekend early voting in the lead-up to runoff votes. This appears to be a direct response to two Democrats’ surprising victory in January’s Senate runoffs.

In other words, the law targets methods of voting that Democrats favored last year. It stinks of bad faith. It is not, as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) pointed out, the most restrictionist of measures being considered in Republican-governed states. But it is emblematic of the Republican Party’s nationwide campaign to curb voting following former president Donald Trump’s campaign of lies about election fraud in 2020.

It takes no great power of analysis to understand the anti-democratic motives behind Republicans’ late fervor to restrict voting. One need only listen to what Republicans themselves say. The Mississippi Free Press this week dredged up a March interview with Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson (R), in which he criticized easing voter registration: “Think about all those woke college and university students now who will automatically be registered to vote,” Mr. Watson said. “You’ve got an uninformed citizen who may not be prepared and ready to vote. Automatically, it’s forced on them: ‘Hey, go make a choice.’ And our country’s going to pay for those choices.”

A party confident in its policies would attempt to win new voters to its side. Republicans in many states, including Georgia, have adopted a different strategy: Make it harder to vote. No, that is not a full return to Jim Crow. But it shows a toxic hostility to democracy that no Republican can take pride in.

26,"Derek Chauvin is a bomb. George Floyd died, but the shrapnel is everywhere.","The answer is usually accountability, for the offender to be punished for the crime, closure. But April Pipkins’s response affected me more than the sum total of all the high-definition snuffings-out I have absorbed, because I could tell this was a question she had labored over. She stared into her lap, using her hands to smooth out her dress as if she were about to reveal a secret that she was ashamed to tell.

“Can they make him alive again?” she replied, half laughing but with enough sincerity to almost make me believe that the question was not rhetorical. I had no answer, so as I searched my own lap for a reply, Pipkins swatted away the awkward silence: “Otherwise, there ain’t no justice.”

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

I have been thinking about her reply as I watch the trial of the former Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd. If Derek Chauvin is found guilty — of second-degree unintentional murder, of third-degree murder, of second-degree manslaughter — would that mean “justice?” It wouldn’t make Floyd alive again, any more than Bradford could be made alive again. But that tragic truth aside, a guilty verdict would also define justice narrowly as holding one man accountable for another man’s death. It isn’t that simple. Because Derek Chauvin is a bomb, and a bomb has many victims. The shrapnel is everywhere.

A bomb is known more for impact than accuracy. And it can’t really be put on trial. Chauvin was in some ways merely the instrument — the bombmaker’s creation. America’s system of policing — its institutions more broadly and society at large — is the bombmaker and deployer. Finding Chauvin guilty is not going to dismantle the bombmaking apparatus.

A bomb is built to explode. That’s why it is armed, why it is loaded onto an airplane and dropped onto a target. When the state-sanctioned policing device that is Chauvin improvised its own explosion on a Minneapolis street last May, the blast radius was littered with Black lives. We saw how the shrapnel injured Darnella Frazier. “When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brother,” she testified at the trial this week. Under oath, the teenage witness revealed that “it’s been nights I stayed apologizing and apologized to George Floyd for not doing more.”

She is a casualty. So are Floyd’s five children, who are now without a father. What about Christopher Martin, the cashier at the nearby store who said he lives with the guilt of doing his job by reporting to his supervisor that Floyd allegedly handed him a counterfeit bill, which led to Floyd’s arrest by Chauvin and his fellow officers? How about Genevieve Hansen, a White firefighter trained as an emergency medical technician who was forced to watch a man die and said she was “desperate” to render medical aid but was prevented by the police from doing so? There are the small-business owners, too, whose storefronts have essentially become tombstones because of Chauvin’s actions. What about Black people in Minneapolis who are now convinced that Chauvin is not an aberration? What about the Black people around the country, like me, who have watched the trial knowing that Floyd’s death is a national story only because it was caught on video?

As for Floyd, what does this country think happens to a person who grew up marginalized by society in a housing project in the poorest section of one of America’s wealthiest cities? In the richest country in the world, Floyd was the first of five siblings to attend college. If justice was even a prospect, we’d be concerned with how Floyd was incarcerated eight times for drug possession and other nonviolent crimes. Justice demands that we acknowledge how poverty and addiction put him at least partly in the position to be a target of the bomb that was Chauvin. If truth and justice ever existed in America, we’d be having a conversation about drugs, rehabilitation, incarceration, police brutality, race, accountability, the over-policing of Black neighborhoods, the existence of “Black neighborhoods” and being Black in America.

Chauvin’s actions annihilated an entire community. While Floyd’s life may be the one thing that we cannot recoup, we should realize that there are other lives for whom justice should be just as vital. True justice demands that this country not absolve Chauvin, the Minneapolis police department or the American system of policing in general by condensing Floyd’s death to the 9½ minutes that Chauvin’s knee was on Floyd’s neck. True justice requires acknowledging all the victims and the guilty. We have to Google the names of the other officers who stood idly by, because it is easier to point the finger at one villainous monster than to wonder who armed a bomb and sent it into a Black community over $20. It is easy for Chauvin’s fellow officers to blame him for misusing deadly force than it is to ask why police are trained to use deadly force at all. Apparently, we need a squad of predictably explosive bombs so badly that we are willing to sacrifice Black lives.

Or maybe this is what justice looks like. Perhaps convicting Chauvin would finally convince this nation to care that police disproportionately kill Black people — so regularly that it cannot be coincidental. Maybe we can cure America’s ill by hoping for something to happen that’s as rare as making George Floyd alive again: convicting a police officer. Perhaps a prison sentence for Chauvin, the bomb that did, after all, self-detonate, would heal all of the people wounded by his shrapnel. I truly hope so.",0

False alarms about vaccines spread with viral intensity along our usually sedate suburban street.

Eventually, though, all these “leads” started to take an emotional toll, not to mention cause sleep deprivation. Now, I say this as a 68-year-old man with no underlying conditions and who’s blessed with good health benefits. I face none of the well-documented struggles of health-care providers, teachers and others in the public sphere who should have been at the front of the vaccination line all along.

So how did so many other people get theirs first? This undeniable example of class and White privilege led to our decision not to travel out of the area to get a shot at some distant CVS pharmacy — whether it was east to Newport News, south to Clarksville near the North Carolina line, west to Charlottesville, or even as far away as Abingdon in far Southwest Virginia.

That’s why weeks later, when that Saturday phone call came, I tried to go back to sleep. My cellphone downstairs started rocking out. I had to go get it.

“Dad!” It was my very thoughtful daughter calling via Skype from abroad. “It’s opening up now. You have to try CVS!”

“Okay!” I said, wishing for a strong cup of coffee to match her intensity level. “We’ll check it out.”

“We” actually meant my wife, Debbie. She was the one who’d been putting in the most time checking the CVS website morning, noon and night. Rubbing sleep out of her eyes, she opened her iPad and set to work. She started by checking the site, but after typing in her age, and Zip code, and entering a date for a shot, there was no response. Even though all of the drugstores’ locations looked open across the state, nothing was coming up.

Taking another tack, Debbie dialed an 888 number and said “agent.” Finally, after so many weeks of silence and frustration, someone answered her call.

“Good morning!” she said. Soon she was engaged in a constructive chat with a young man who told her that, for him, it was the middle of the night.

He was working from home. This led to some comic moments, such as when he said, “Sorry, ma’am, my dog’s barking. Could you please repeat your numbers?”

Soon they were buzzing through a long registration form, easily overcoming any problems caused by distance or language.

Within 30 minutes, Debbie was assigned to a random location and her appointment times were coming in via text and email. After more form-filling, my information arrived as well.

But there was a catch. We had to head out of town to the arbitrarily chosen pharmacy site, some 100 miles to the northwest in Gainesville. After spending more time on Google Maps, a few days later we were cruising along what we call the back way to Dulles International Airport: Get off Interstate 95, take a deep breath of relief, then drive up U.S. 17 through the farms and bedroom communities of Fauquier County.

Some time later, we pulled up to a very large CVS. A group of baby boomers was lining up as though Jimmy Buffett tickets were going on sale.

Once Debbie’s phone app gave her a 15-minute notice, she was allowed inside. And because everything was running on time, I got in, too, well before my later appointment.

28,"Your questions about coronavirus vaccines, answered","chevron-right Can I return to my old activities?

The CDC advises fully vaccinated people that they can gather indoors with other fully vaccinated people without wearing masks or social distancing. The agency also says fully vaccinated people can gather indoors with unvaccinated people from a single household without wearing masks or social distancing — if the unvaccinated are healthy and at low risk of contracting severe covid-19 disease. That would free older people to see nearby children and grandchildren. Long-distance travel is also low-risk and fully vaccinated people do not need to quarantine or get tested, but government health officials have said it is still not recommended.

Visits to unvaccinated people at higher risk, such as older people or those with underlying health conditions, still should be conducted outdoors, or in a well-ventilated space, and with masks on, the CDC says.

The CDC considers fully vaccinated to mean two weeks after a final shot of vaccine.

Fully vaccinated people also do not need to quarantine or be tested if they are exposed to the virus as long as they do not develop symptoms. Fully vaccinated employees of high-density workplaces such as meatpacking plants without symptoms also do not need to quarantine after an exposure. But a test is recommended to be certain.

Public health experts say in the short term, life will look much the same after you get vaccinated, until a larger share of the population is vaccinated and the pandemic is curbed. For the most part, they recommend that people still wear masks and maintain their distance around most people.

One reason for caution is that the vaccines in use are robustly — but not completely — effective at preventing covid-19 from the original strain of the coronavirus they were tested against. They also may confer less protection against newer variants first identified in South Africa and Brazil that are now circulating in the United States. So there is a small possibility that people who are vaccinated could get sick, though it is very unlikely they would be hospitalized or die.

Scientists haven’t ruled out the possibility that people who have been inoculated can transmit the virus to the unvaccinated. They are hoping to have data on that issue in the next few months and, if it shows that vaccinated people cannot be carriers, that could lead to more relaxed interactions.",0
29,What you need to know about the coronavirus variants,"What you need to know about the coronavirus variants

Viruses are always mutating and taking on new forms. The coronavirus has thousands of variants that have been identified. But several, including variants first found in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil, are highly transmissible and have sparked concerns that vaccines may be less effective against them.

The same protective measures that have warded off the virus throughout the pandemic — maintaining social distance, wearing masks and washing our hands — are even more critical in the face of more transmissible variants.

The New York variant (B.1.526)

Where and when was it discovered?

This variant, which was found in samples obtained as early as November, probably emerged in the Washington Heights section of New York, Fauci told reporters in March. By the middle of that month, this variant made up nearly half of the city’s new infections.

Where is it now?

Officials have reported this variant in at least 14 other states, including Texas, Wyoming and Maryland, Bloomberg reported.

What makes it different?

Some scientists are concerned that this variant may be more transmissible than previous versions. Scott Gottlieb, former director of the Food and Drug Administration, expressed worry that a mutation on this variant could enable it to reinfect people who have already had the virus.

Will vaccines work?

This variant seems to have some resistance to existing vaccines, although not as much as the variant first detected in South Africa, Fauci said on CBS News’s “Face the Nation.” Gottlieb said he was also concerned that this variant could partly elude the effects of vaccination.

The South Africa variant (B.1.351)

Where and when was it discovered?

This mutation, also referred to as 501Y.V2, was found in South Africa in early October and announced in December, when the country’s health minister said the strain seemed to affect young people more than previous strains. This variant may have contributed to a surge of infections and hospitalizations across South Africa.

Where is it?

This mutation has been identified in at least four dozen countries. On Jan. 28, South Carolina officials announced that this variant had affected two people there with no travel history — the first instances of this strain identified in the United States. It has since been found in more than two dozen other states.

What makes it different?

This mutation shares some similarities to the variant first identified in the U.K. and, like that strain, appears to be more transmissible. There is no evidence that it is more lethal. Gottlieb has suggested that this variant might be more resistant to antibody therapies.

There is some evidence that this variant could allow for reinfection: A man in France was in critical condition in mid-February after being infected with this strain four months after he was previously infected with the virus.

Will vaccines work?

The vaccines may have a diminished impact against this variant, but they probably will still be effective, top infectious-diseases expert Anthony S. Fauci said in January. Moderna has said its vaccine protects against the variant first identified in South Africa, with an important caveat: The vaccine-elicited antibodies were also less effective at neutralizing this mutation in a laboratory dish.

Pfizer and BioNTech released their own study, not yet peer-reviewed, that suggests their vaccine effectively neutralizes this variant, though was slightly less effective.

On Jan. 29, Johnson & Johnson said its single-shot vaccine was robustly effective in a massive global trial, but that its protection against sickness was weaker in South Africa. Biotechnology company Novavax has also indicated that its vaccine was significantly less effective during a trial in South Africa.

In South Africa, the distribution of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been halted. The vaccine did not provide sufficient protection against mild and moderate cases caused by a new variant, health officials said.

U.K. variant (B.1.1.7)

Where and when was it discovered?

This variant was first found in the United Kingdom, specifically in London and the nearby county of Kent, in September. It is sometimes referred to as the “Kent” variant. It has been spreading rapidly in Britain, Denmark and Ireland since December.

Where is it?

Dozens of countries, including the United States, have seen infections from this variant of the virus. It is by far the most prevalent variant of concern in the United States, with thousands of cases across the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a model forecast in early January that indicated the variant could become the dominant strain in the United States by some point in March. A recent study showed this variant was spreading rapidly in the United States by early February.

What makes it different?

The variant first identified in the U.K. appears more transmissible than the more common strain. Preliminary data also suggests that this strain may be 30 to 70 percent more lethal than previous mutations.

Will vaccines work?

The scientific consensus is that the vaccines will remain effective against this mutation because those inoculations provoke an array of neutralizing antibodies and other immune-system responses. Biotechnology companies Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax have said their vaccines appear to work against this variant.

Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, found in a study of older adults that the immune response triggered by the Pfizer vaccine was modestly less effective against the variant first identified in the U.K.

The ‘Eeek’ mutation (E484K)

Where and when was it discovered?

This might best be described as a mutation within a mutation. It’s called E484K — or “Eeek,” as epidemiologists refer to it — and it’s appearing on some of the variants we describe below. It’s not brand new; it has appeared many times since the start of the pandemic, but experts have been concerned about it. It gained mainstream attention when it started to coincide with other variants that are more contagious.

Where is it?

Eeek has been seen in the variants first discovered in the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. It has also been detected in more than 200 samples of the virus sequenced in the United States since May.

What makes it different?

The Eeek mutation changes the virus’s spike protein, which is what vaccines target. By itself, this mutation does not change the virus significantly. The concern with this mutation is when it’s paired with the other variants, which could help the virus evade detection and make neutralization by the human immune system less efficient.

Will vaccines work?

Scientists are actively trying to answer this question. Clinical trial data have indicated that vaccines were less effective in preventing infections with variants in South Africa featuring the mutation. But the vaccines still dramatically lowered the chance of severe illness or death.

Semi-related to the vaccine question: One study found preliminary evidence that patients in South Africa who had survived an earlier bout with the more common coronavirus were becoming infected a second time — though not severely ill — after exposure to the variant with this mutation.

Brazil variant (P. 1)

Where and when was it discovered?

Sequencing studies found the variant in Brazil, mainly in Rio de Janeiro, as early as July. Researchers in Japan discovered it in travelers from Brazil in January.

Where is it now?

It has been confirmed in more than two dozen countries, including Japan, Spain and New Zealand. On Jan. 25, Minnesota health officials confirmed the first U.S. case of this variant in a resident with recent travel history to Brazil. It has since been found in at least 18 states.

What makes it different?

The variant has more than a dozen alterations, several of which are found on the virus’s spike protein, which binds the virus to a cell. Because of that, researchers think the strain is probably more transmissible. There is also some early evidence that antibodies might not recognize the P.1 variant, which could lead to reinfection.

Will vaccines work?

There’s no strong evidence right now suggesting that vaccines won’t work against the variant first identified in Brazil. However, scientists have raised the possibility that this variant can evade antibodies, which would impact the current vaccines’ effectiveness.

A study of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine published in March determined that it was highly effective at neutralizing the variant found in Brazil. Moderna has announced that it would develop a new vaccine tailored to a similar variant in case an updated shot becomes necessary.

The Denmark/California mutation (L452R)

Where and when was it discovered?

This mutation was detected in Denmark in March.

Where is it now?

A variant with this mutation was found in California this winter and became dominant there over five months, eventually making up more than half of infections in 44 of the state’s 58 counties. This mutation has also been confirmed in several other states.

What makes it different?

There is evidence that this mutation enhances the virus’s ability to bind to human receptor cells, making it more transmissible. Some scientists are urging public-health officials to declare the variant with this mutation circulating in California a “variant of concern,” which would make it the first homegrown variant with this label.

Will vaccines work?

Some scientists think this mutation might make the virus more resistant to vaccines because the mutation is in the spike protein, which enables the virus to attach to cells. But scientists also say that more study is needed before they can draw conclusions.

New research shows California coronavirus variant is more transmissible

Another coronavirus variant linked to growing share of cases, several large outbreaks, in California

The original variant (D614G)

Where and when was it discovered?

This mutation, known to scientists simply as “G,” was discovered in China in January 2020. It soon spread through New York City and Europe.

Where is it?

The “G” mutation has become ubiquitous. By July, about 70 percent of the 50,000 genomes of the coronavirus uploaded by researchers worldwide to a shared database carried the variant.

What makes it different?

Some scientists think this mutation is significantly more transmissible than the original strain of the virus. That’s because this variant has four to five times more spikes on its surface. Those spikes enable the virus to latch onto and infect cells. But other scientists still contest the greater transmissibility.

Will vaccines work?

The G variant was the dominant strain when 2020 vaccine trials took place. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed a 95 percent efficacy in trials.

This coronavirus mutation has taken over the world. Scientists are trying to understand why.

British officials identify coronavirus mutations, but significance remains unclear

How can we protect ourselves from the variants?

The same protective measures that have warded off the virus throughout the pandemic — maintaining social distance, wearing masks and washing our hands — are even more critical in the face of more transmissible variants. Those guidelines will simultaneously keep you from becoming ill from one of those variants, while making it harder for the virus to mutate in the first place.

“Viruses don’t mutate unless they replicate,” Fauci said in January.

But it’s also important for scientists to learn as much as they can about these variants, in case there are specific ways we can slow their spread. Until the research exists, we can’t make assumptions about what new variants will do.

What do the variants mean for vaccines?

“We need to get as many people vaccinated with the current vaccine that we have as we possibly can … and prepare for the potential eventuality that we might have to update this vaccine sometime in the future.” — Fauci in January

As more significant variants are reported, the obvious (and arguably most important) question is whether the vaccines will work on them. Some of the mutations have sparked particular concern because they affect the spikes on the virus, which is what the vaccines target.

In short, the pharmaceutical companies are testing new variants against their vaccines and spinning up new trials. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech can update their vaccines quickly because of their mRNA technology, which can be reprogrammed to target new variants.

Pfizer and Moderna have run tests on the variants and while the vaccines still triggered a response, they appeared to be less effective.

A growing number of scientists anticipate that we will eventually need something similar to the annual flu shot — companies will periodically update their vaccines to match the prevalent coronavirus variants, and we will need to get boosters to stay protected.

“With flu, we need to adapt the vaccines. We can see that already,” said Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge. “The companies do realize there is a problem in the longer term, and they will deal with it just as we have done with flu every year.”

Although state leaders have said that they prefer that vaccines only go to their state’s residents, some mass vaccination sites in Maryland and Virginia have made appointments available to residents of the District and other jurisdictions.

Within states, residents have been confused about whether they can get vaccinated in a county where they don’t live. Prince George’s County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) announced Jan. 25 that her county’s health officials are canceling appointments scheduled by Marylanders who don’t live or work in the county, but mass vaccination sites including Six Flags in Prince George’s remain open to all Marylanders. In Northern Virginia, frustrated residents who are not yet eligible in their communities have gotten their shots in rural areas that are further along the state’s various tiers of eligibility.

How can I make an appointment or register to get a vaccine?

D.C. residents who are eligible can sign up for a vaccination appointment here. In addition to the city’s registration system, which allows eligible residents and workers to sign up for shots at retail pharmacies and other locations, the website also offers information about the many D.C. hospital systems that have their own registration systems for vaccinations. Eligible patients might want to try multiple registration systems. Children’s National opened a waitlist for 16- and 17-year-olds with medical conditions who qualify for the vaccine. Only 200 spots will be available on the waitlist at a time; Diana Troese, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said new spots may open daily.

On March 10, the city’s revamped portal for vaccine appointments launched. It asks eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment. Once registrants are chosen to get a vaccine, they will be notified through a call, a text or an email and will need to book their appointment within 48 hours — or wait until they are selected again. Going forward, invitations will be sent out at 10 a.m. Thursdays and Sundays. Eligible individuals may also register over the phone. Forty percent of the initial portal appointments will be reserved for residents 65 and older, while an additional 40 percent will go to residents ages 18 to 64 with a qualifying medical condition. Twenty percent of appointments will go to essential workers. Half of all these appointments are reserved for people who live in priority Zip codes.

Maryland residents who are eligible to get vaccinated can find a vaccination clinic here and register directly with the vaccine provider. Maryland residents may also need to contact multiple clinics from this map to find an appointment. The state launched a centralized preregistration system for people to sign up for appointments at the state’s mass vaccination sites. By the end of April, there will be 12 mass vaccination sites statewide. As of April 6, the mass vaccination sites in Salisbury and Hagerstown also provide shots on a walk-up basis. The M&T Bank Stadium site will provide walk-up access starting the week of April 12.

Virginia created a statewide registration system for residents to register for vaccine appointments. Residents can also call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA to register. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the state system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here.

What about mass vaccination sites?

Maryland has several mass sites across the state, including Six Flags in Prince George’s, M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Regency Furniture Stadium in Charles County, and others in Hagerstown and Salisbury. Twelve will be open by the end of April. Virginia also has several mass vaccination sites, including at the Stonebridge Vaccination Center in Alexandria and at the former Gander Mountain store at the Potomac Mills shopping plaza in Prince William County. The District opened a mass vaccination site at Arena Stage in Southwest D.C. on April 9. Most operate on an appointment-only basis; Maryland’s mass vaccination sites in Hagerstown, Salisbury and at the M&T Bank Stadium site in Baltimore are accepting a limited number of walk-ups without appointments.

I’m a senior citizen. How do I get a vaccine?

In the District, senior citizens can sign up for appointments at vaccinate.dc.gov or can call 855-363-0333 to register by phone.

Some senior citizens in the District can also make a vaccine appointment through a hospital system or a health clinic, including Kaiser Permanente, Howard University, Sibley and George Washington University health systems and nonprofits including Mary’s Center, Community of Hope, Bread for the City and more. Some appointments are open only to existing patients of those clinics, and some hospital appointments are open to all. The District provides links to all of the health-care providers giving shots here.

In Maryland, residents over 65 get priority through health departments and mass vaccination sites, and can find a vaccination clinic here.

In Virginia, residents can use the state’s registration system to register for vaccine appointments, or call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here. And those seeking to get vaccinated through CVS must still register through that pharmacy’s website, which is not connected with the statewide system.

I’m a health-care worker or front-line essential worker. How do I get a vaccine?

You may be able to get vaccinated at your workplace. If not, follow the same steps described above for senior citizens if you work in the District or Virginia. If you work in Maryland, you should receive information about registering for a vaccine through your workplace.

I’m not eligible yet. How can I find out when it’s my turn to get a vaccine?

In Maryland, residents who are signed up for the state’s emergency text alerts will get a text message each time the state starts vaccinating a new group. To sign up, send a text message to 898211 with the phrase “MdReady.” All residents age 16 and over are eligible at mass vaccination sites now and beginning on April 12 at other providers.

Virginia residents can check their health departments’ websites for more information on vaccine stages. (Click here for Virginia.)

D.C. plans to make the remaining essential workers eligible in stages. On March 29, journalists who work in person and ride-share drivers became eligible.

The District plans to open vaccine eligibility to all residents age 16 and up on April 12. This does not mean that there will be enough doses available to give every adult a shot that day, but any adult can seek a vaccine at that point.

Which groups will get vaccinated next?

Maryland began making vaccines available to everyone 16 and older on April 6. The District and Virginia are moving through their final categories of essential workers. Virginia plans to make everyone 16 and older eligible by April 18. The District will do that on April 12.

Will I be notified when it’s my turn to get a vaccine?

Not automatically. Maryland residents can sign up for notifications by texting the phrase “MdReady” to the number 898211. Marylanders also can preregister for the state’s mass vaccination sites here.

District residents can preregister for a vaccine appointment here. It will ask eligible residents to register once and then await an email with a link they can use to make an appointment.

Virginia’s statewide registration system will send out weekly reminders to residents that they are still in the queue. Fairfax County, which has opted out of the state’s registration system, launched its own data dashboard, which allows people who signed up with that county to get more information about when they might get appointments.

Can I volunteer to help out at a vaccination site?

Right now, the D.C. Medical Reserve Corps is taking both medical and nonmedical volunteers ages 18 and older on an as-needed basis. In Maryland, volunteers can sign up for the Maryland Responds Medical Reserve Corps. And Virginia has the Virginia Medical Reserve Corps. More volunteer opportunities may become available later as vaccinations continue to ramp up.

Are pharmacies giving doses to anyone if they have extra doses left at the end of the day?

A few lucky people have happened onto a shot this way, like law student David MacMillan, who recorded his experience in a TikTok video that went viral. McMillan and a friend were shopping at a Giant grocery store in Northeast Washington when a pharmacist offered to vaccinate them because she had an open vial of the vaccine that would otherwise be discarded and the store was closing soon.

Could the same thing happen to you? It’s unlikely.

The D.C. health department does urge pharmacists to use doses on any available person rather than let them expire. However, hospitals and health centers have an on-call list of their own staff who are not front-line workers but who could get vaccinated if an extra dose needs to be used. Hanging out at your nearest pharmacy, or calling grocery stores, is not at all likely to get you a vaccination — and spending extra time in public places is a very bad idea if you’re not vaccinated.

Are coronavirus vaccinations free?

Yes. Under federal law, Americans won’t pay for the vaccine.",0
31,The covid-19 symptoms to watch out for,"Although this list is not inclusive of every possible symptom, it includes what physicians and health experts have determined are the most common. Some of these symptoms will coincide with one another. Symptoms of a coronavirus infection can emerge anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.

Fever, cough or shortness of breath

Fever, cough or shortness of breath are the highest-frequency symptoms of covid-19. According to a study of symptoms in about 11,000 adult covid-19 patients, at least one of these symptoms was reported in 93 percent of cases.

Story continues below advertisement

Fever or chills

A fever might be the first indication you have a covid-19 infection, according to a recent study that looked at the onset of symptoms.

The fever itself can range from low-grade — maybe only a degree or two higher than normal — to dangerously high. A fever higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheit is considered very high in adults and is a sign of a severe infection.

You can experience chills in which your body feels cold for no apparent reason. It might be a cozy temperature, but you’re still shivering. Chills are most common with a fever, or when a fever is coming on, but they don’t always coincide with fever.

Cough

The coronavirus is a respiratory illness, so cough is a common symptom, and it can also appear early in the infection. A dry, persistent cough can be a red flag that you have covid-19.

Story continues below advertisement

Shortness of breath

Along with the cough can come shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.

Covid-19 can sometimes cause pneumonia, according to Panagis Galiatsatos, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Johns Hopkins.

Pneumonia occurs when “air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms,” Galiatsatos writes.

Shortness of breath caused by covid-19 can be mild or severe enough to require treatment with supplemental oxygen or a ventilator.

Fatigue or muscle aches

Sometimes the only indication that you might have of a viral infection is a general sickly feeling, or what physicians call fatigue — a persistent exhaustion that isn’t solved by getting more sleep.

Story continues below advertisement

In extreme cases, people who have suffered from covid-19 describe having barely enough energy to walk to the bathroom, or to the kitchen for a glass of water.

Advertisement

Some people report muscle aches or general achiness for no other apparent reason.

Fatigue and aches have also been reported by so-called covid-19 “long-haulers,” who continue to experience symptoms of the illness for weeks or months after becoming infected.

Headache

Headache is the most common neurological symptom in covid-19.

Other less-common neurological symptoms could include muscle weakness, tingling or numbness in the hands and feet, dizziness, confusion, delirium, seizures and stroke, according to Harvard Medical School.

Loss or distorted sense of smell or taste

The loss of smell or taste is typically linked to early symptoms of upper-respiratory infections — including previous coronavirus strains — because the virus damages olfactory bulbs that are involved in the sense of smell.

Story continues below advertisement

It appears to be more common for people who have covid-19, and it’s possible to lose your sense of smell or taste while experiencing no other symptoms.

Advertisement

Another possible symptom is a distorted sense of smell or taste.

Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Smell and Taste Center, told The Washington Post that certain distortions, including one that causes everything to have a fecal-like odor, can make common food and drinks revolting, because flavor is tied to sense of smell. “Even water can become unpleasant,” he said.

The distortions are most common in people who are recovering from covid-19 and starting to get their smell back, according to Justin Turner, medical director of Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Smell and Taste Center.

Sore throat, congestion or runny nose

A sore throat, congestion or runny nose are less frequently associated with covid-19, but they still occur in enough cases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention added them to its list.

Story continues below advertisement

A runny nose was reported by about 7 percent of adult patients in the study of symptom frequency, while a sore throat was reported by 35 percent.

It can be difficult to determine whether these symptoms are a result of covid-19 or something more benign, such as allergies.

But allergies, which are an overreaction of the immune system to foreign particles, would not trigger things such as a fever, muscle aches or chills, according to Sally Joo Bailey, an allergist at Allergy Associates of Northern Virginia in Arlington. Those are the classic signs of a viral infection, such as covid-19.

Stomach issues

Studies have found that about half of coronavirus patients experience at least one gastrointestinal symptom, which can include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain or discomfort.

In the study of symptom frequency, diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal-related symptom in adults, and abdominal pain was the least common.

Difference between covid-19 and the flu

The potential winter surge of coronavirus infections could coincide with another major public health event: the seasonal flu. Here's what you need to know. (The Washington Post)

A key difference is the transmissivity: The coronavirus spreads more easily than the flu. Public health officials have encouraged everyone to get vaccinated against the flu this year to help ward off a bad flu season superimposed on a pandemic — and having had a flu shot could also help rule it out if you start to experience any of these symptoms.

Ultimately, infectious-disease doctors say most people won’t be able to tell which illness they have. Common warning signs for both include fever, cough, chills and shortness of breath.

Story continues below advertisement

The one symptom that’s common with covid-19, but not with the flu, is loss of taste and smell. But not everyone with covid-19 experiences that symptom, and experts warned that someone with allergies or a cold might also struggle to smell because they have a stuffy nose.

Absent a loss of taste or smell, most patients will need a nasal swab to get a proper diagnosis.",0
32,"For the first wave of vaccinated vacationers, venturing into the not-quite-open-world was quiet, cheaper — and a relief","“We were caring for sicker people than we ever have, dealing with more deaths than we’re equipped to deal with,” Hammerslag said. The whole experience was “supremely terrifying.”

So as soon as Hammerslag got her second coronavirus vaccine dose in January, she knew what she wanted to do. Along with her best friend and her best friend’s husband (two fellow hospital workers) and their kids, she booked a vacation. “We looked at Aspen, Vail and Park City,” she said. Park City, Utah, especially, “was much cheaper than normal.”

For five days in February, Hammerslag and her friends skied during the day and relaxed in a rental at night. It wasn’t a normal winter ski trip: Restaurants were closed, social-distancing protocols were enforced. There was little to do besides skiing. “But I think all three of us felt like even if we just sit in the condo that we rented with the blinds open watching the snow fall, we’re going to be happy,” Hammerslag recalled. “Just because we just wanted that escape so badly.”

A month or so after Americans began receiving coronavirus vaccine doses in December, the first wave of fully vaccinated citizens (many of them health-care workers like Hammerslag) started doing what anyone would after the year they’d just had: going on vacation. Finally out from under a cloud of worry about falling seriously ill with covid-19, they ventured out and explored. Often they found the world outside still somewhat empty, quiet and slowed-down (sometimes in a pleasant way, sometimes not).

The “vaccination vacations” these travelers have enjoyed in the past few months have almost certainly played a role in the ongoing recovery of the travel industry. The travel search site Kayak.com, for example, reported that flight bookings had finally started to steadily climb back up in the first three months of the year. Rosalind Smith, general manager of the nationwide travel agency Superior Cruise & Travel, noted March 31 that her firm had lately been working with a higher-than-usual volume of essential workers hoping to get out of town ASAP. She also said that the previous two weeks and the following one would be the heaviest travel weeks the firm had seen since the start of the pandemic.

Vacations like these, though — cheap, largely outdoorsy, tranquil but embarked upon with a sense of urgency — may soon fade into the past, a weird, dated memory of a surreal moment in history. On April 2, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made a formal proclamation that fully vaccinated people can travel without self-quarantining.

For some vaccinated Americans traveling in early 2021, the peace and quiet, and the relative scarcity of other travelers, has been part of the appeal of post-vaccine vacations. Erin Guttormson, a pediatric dentist based in Tucson, got her second dose Feb. 9. Two of her health-care-worker friends, fellow vaccinées, invited her along on a Thursday-to-Sunday stay at a resort in Cancún, Mexico. The three friends arrived Feb. 25 and spent most of their vacation lounging in the sunshine and enjoying spa treatments at the resort, which was restricted to partial capacity.

“While it wasn’t an empty scenario, it wasn’t back to what I would say a full-capacity situation would be,” said Guttormson, 36. “We didn’t have to, like, make reservations at restaurants or anything. You could get in wherever and kind of do anything you wanted.” At night, the trio had dinner and drinks with two new friends: a married pair of physicians from South Dakota, themselves both recently vaccinated and badly in need of a vacation.

Like Hammerslag, Guttormson found that traveling when no one else is means dramatically lower prices. She paid for the Cancún vacation with credit card points, but when she booked another vacation in Hawaii for later this spring, her flights cost less than $400 round-trip.

Still, safely vacationing during a pandemic doesn’t necessarily mean a vacation from the pandemic. Escaping one’s own lockdown conditions isn’t the same as escaping lockdown, and for many, vacations haven’t felt quite like the carefree getaways they imagined.

Jason Anderson, a 41-year-old victim advocate who lives in Denver, lucked into a leftover at a vaccine site and completed his immunization process in February. At the end of March, he and a vaccinated friend packed their bags and flew to Walt Disney World.

The Disney parks, Anderson said, were livelier than he had expected; he was somewhat surprised at how long the lines for rides were in Month 12 of a pandemic. But other parts of the experience weren’t quite what people go to Disney expecting. The parks’ beloved dining scene had largely been collapsed into an app-based meal-pickup service, and a battalion of Disney characters wandered around carrying signs reminding guests to wear their masks over their nose and mouth.

Lisa Butler, a therapist based in Chicago, was dismayed to find that when she finally got the vaccine and visited some family in Little Rock in mid-March, her DoubleTree hotel had suspended many of its guest services. To Butler, being able to order room service, sit at the bar and have her bed made daily are “the best part” of staying at a hotel. When she suddenly had to request new towels, “that was a little disconcerting to me. I was like, what is this?” Butler said with a laugh. She has made peace with the fact that there will also be no room service at the resort where she will be staying on her upcoming 52nd-birthday trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. But she looks forward to being able to dine poolside, unmasked.

As these stories illustrate, vaccination vacationers have sought out destinations where they can spend a lot of time outdoors — largely because indoor spaces are still under so many more restrictions by comparison. Smith, of Superior Cruise & Travel, noted that while a number of countries still have closed borders because of the pandemic, warm-weather domestic destinations and nearby tropical nations that are open to U.S. travelers have been especially popular lately. Mexico and Hawaii are two of the agency’s most in-demand vacation spots at the moment, Smith said. (Smith herself has been working from Playa Del Carmen since the first day of the year.)

Smith has also seen increased activity in Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Rico. According to a statement from Brad Dean, CEO of Discover Puerto Rico, hotel occupancy at the end of March was 16 percent higher than pre-pandemic, and demand for independent rentals is starting to outpace even 2019, “which was a record-setting year for Puerto Rico.”

The days of the vaccination vacation as Guttormson and Hammerslag have known it, though — the lone, rare vaccinated traveler venturing out into a world that’s still partly shut down — are numbered. Soon enough, popular travel destinations will probably be bursting at the seams with post-pandemic visitors. But the relief and relaxation that come from taking a vacation after a hard, stressful, grief-stricken year aren’t going anywhere; indeed, they have been a reliable outcome of even the most pandemic-dampened trips.

For Hammerslag, a vacation to literally anywhere might have done the trick: “A few days without beeping monitors, without calling ‘code blues’ ” was enough, she said. And Anderson, who spoke to The Washington Post just a few days after returning from Orlando, said Disney World under covid-19 protocols was “still the happiest place on Earth.”

33,A father-son backpacking trip in the Grand Canyon is an introduction to adventure,"Um, no. Camp, at Hermit Creek, is seven miles and nearly 2,500 vertical feet below, a trek that will take us several more hours. We’re descending the Hermit Trail, a poorly maintained path off the canyon’s South Rim, and have paused on a precipice, across which we can see many of the canyon’s neatly stacked layers: the chalky beiges and browns of the upper Kaibab, Toroweap and Coconino formations, which yield to the pinkish pastels of the Hermit, Supai and Redwall deposits below. This is on display in cliffs hundreds of feet tall, a stark reminder of how far we have to go — and how quickly we could get there with one misstep.

We are here largely because of a birthday note Kai wrote me two years ago in which he declared, “You used to be a wild 10-year-old like me and now you’re a wild 53-year-old. I love you so much and never want to leave you. But until then we can do so many things together! I am practically squirming in my seat thinking about when I’m old enough for the Grand Canyon!”

There are, I suppose, dads who could resist that, just as there are fathers who would plan an experience-appropriate trip for their sons. I am neither, so here we are. Never mind that, aside from simply being 12, Kai has done almost nothing to physically prepare for this. Or that I haven’t backpacked in 13 years. Or that my badly dated gear is far heavier than what most people carry these days. The exception: our hiking boots, which we bought a week ago and “broke in” in a stroll around our neighborhood the day before we flew out here.

All of this might be fine in a place where car, cell reception and emergency help are within reasonable reach. But in the Grand Canyon, the slightest mishap — sprained ankle, dehydration, gastrointestinal ailment, broken water filter — can become a code red emergency, and it might even prove fatal because help, if you can summon it at all, could take many hours to arrive.

Although I spend my share of time adventuring, and don’t sincerely believe I’m leading Kai to his doom, I’m still far more anxious than I’d be if I was flying solo here. This wouldn’t be the case had I secured a permit to camp solely along the Grand Canyon’s heavily trafficked main corridor trails, which feature ranger stations, emergency phones and at least occasional sources of potable water (though even those trails are daunting).

Story continues below advertisement

Instead we have two nights in what the national park calls threshold campsites, with pit toilets (BYO TP) and no other amenities, before a final night in the corridor. We’re carrying all our food (mostly dehydrated meals) and will have to filter our drinking water, but at least we’re camping near reliable streams. And, while backpacking poses a low risk of coronavirus transmission, we have masks at the ready for anyone we meet on the trail, and we double-masked throughout our travel here.

We head on past low, twisty juniper and pinyon trees and clumps of sagebrush clinging to the severe terrain. Soon the view broadens to the North Rim, and the stack grows deeper, down to the shadowy, 1.8 billion-year-old Vishnu, a panorama that leaves Kai spellbound. “This place is amazing,” he says, before inquiring again about the time left before he can cast off his pack. He has never even put on a backpack before; I rented him this one en route in Flagstaff, Ariz., at the same store where I bought his oversized hiking pants. That, coupled with the sun shirt and brimmed hat he borrowed from my wife, lends him a likeness to Paddington Bear, out on a grand adventure.

Oddly, a century ago we would have had an easier go of it. The Hermit Trail was once a supremely maintained path that guided groups traveled on muleback to and from a luxury camp at Hermit Creek. The trail and camp were built in 1911 by the Fred Harvey Co., the hospitality division of the Santa Fe Railway, as an alternative to the Bright Angel Trail, which was controlled as a concession by the businessman — and eventual U.S. senator — Ralph Cameron.

A set of steep, scree-strewn switchbacks ejects us onto the Tonto Platform, a sloping shelf of sage-hued shale festooned with prickly pear and barrel cactus, blackbrush and spindly yucca. From here, we will head a couple of miles downriver to Hermit Creek, then buttonhook upriver to camp one night each in Monument Creek and Indian Creek before hiking out the Bright Angel Trail on Friday.

We arrive in Hermit dusty, beat and famished — where have you gone, Fred Harvey? — but with no injuries, blisters or other serious concerns. We find a site among the half-dozen or so etched into a steep embankment above the creek, with ample space between us and the two other parties here, a solo guy and two women.

Nightfall in the canyon, depending on your mood, can be magical or ominous. Darkness pours into every crevice, pressed by chilling air, and tiny sounds assume deep backstories. We navigate a narrow path to the creek and, lulled by the sound of a waterfall, lie back on a boulder to take in the stars. Twice I suggest we turn in. “Not yet,” Kai says. “This is too unbelievable.”

The Wednesday plan is to knock out the 3½ easy miles to Monument Creek, drop our packs and hike a mile — and 1,000 vertical feet — down to the Colorado River. And we reach Monument by 1 p.m., well in time for the river hike. But as I’m unloading gear I glance up to see that my boy has fallen asleep, standing up, while leaning against a sun-baked rock. I backslide into a pit of guilt, and begin to worry deeply about our 11-mile day tomorrow.

Later, we are chatting with a trio of 50-something hikers from Flagstaff, when one of them interrupts herself: “Just so you know: There’s a bighorn sheep walking across the cliff right behind you.”

Indeed there is — muscular, agile, with those flamboyant, comma-shaped horns. Once it reaches the far side of camp, it lies down and stares back from where it came. Kai is rapt, prodding me to take more photos and reporting on the animal’s every move as I make dinner.

We also meet two solo campers at Monument Creek, a guy named George VanMeter who posts videos of his backpacking trips on his YouTube channel, GeorgeBackpacking, and an Oregonian named Jo Zacher, who is nearing the end of a 50-day hike. “It gives you more time to stare at nature,” she explains. Like most long-haul Grand Canyoneers, Zacher had cached food — in sealed, labeled plastic bins, to dissuade theft by wildlife or humans — at strategic points along her route. She had also endured many bitter, snowy nights, and her melancholic tone suggests she is ready to go home.

That night, the wind ramps up, and rain peppers the tent in bursts. I sleep maybe four hours and awaken with fresh worries: Will it rain all day? Can we filter enough water for an 11-mile trudge? (Of the two streams between camps, one is too silty to drink and the other, at Horn Creek, is radioactive because of uranium deposits in the hills above. “Drink here only if your only other option is death by thirst,” our permit says.) And: Is this the day Kai cracks and folds?

But when we march out of Monument Creek at 7:30 a.m., with cool mist billowing down from the rim, I’m optimistic. Kai sets a brisk pace as the trail lurches up from the wash, then levels for the long haul.

For most of the next few hours we feel like we are walking in place. The Tonto wends into a huge, red-walled embayment, called the Inferno, and our view — while stirring — holds distressingly steady. At one point Kai spots the Flagstaffers, who had left camp 30 minutes ahead of us, on the other side of the drainage, well within shouting distance. “Hey, Dad, they’re right there! We’ll catch them soon.”

Story continues below advertisement

But when we round the next bend it becomes clear just how far the trail goes before doubling back toward the river. Alas, they are at least an hour ahead.

By noon, the clouds have vanished, the temperature has settled in the high 50s, and we have wrestled free of the Inferno. At many points we can see — and often hear — the river, a vein of quenching green sluicing far below. Vantages into the inner gorge show clusters of sharp spires hewed from the dark Vishnu rock. But it’s still a long day. As we trundle along, Indian Garden rises in my imagination, an oasis pulsing with taco trucks and margarita bars, live music and happy mules ready to shuttle our packs up to the South Rim.

Kai breaks my reverie. “What are those ropes?” I’m convinced he’s hallucinating, but then I see them, too, telephone lines looping from the rim toward the corridor trails.

Story continues below advertisement

Even without taco trucks, Indian Garden is another dimension: mule stables, squared-off campsites with picnic tables, shelters and wildlife-proof food boxes, water spigots and the ranger station, all tucked in a grove of green-leafed cottonwood trees. George and the Flagstaff crew are there, as are at least five other parties, and my second emotion, after deep relief, is of overcrowding.

Friday we rise before dawn and are the first ones out of camp; for an hour we have the Bright Angel Trail and its soaring scenery to ourselves.

A third of the way into our five-mile, 3,100-vertical-foot ascent, George breezes past us. A dad on Day Four cannot compete with a budding YouTuber. Kai finds another gear, shadowing George and firing off questions as we rise through the layers, past descending mule trains and day hikers, over stretches of snow and ice, and finally onto the level ground of the South Rim. In that birthday card Kai had also written, “Even when you’re 100 you will always be wild.” Nice. If I’m lucky enough to make it there, it looks like I’ll have company.

34,"Calculate how much you would get from the $1,400 (or more) coronavirus checks","Calculate how much you would get from the $1,400 (or more) coronavirus checks

A third round of stimulus checks, part of the Biden administration’s “American Rescue Plan,” has been signed into law.

Use the calculator below to see how large a check you’ll receive. If you’ve already filed your 2020 taxes, the check will most likely be based on that income. If you haven’t, it will be based on your 2019 taxes.

The $1.9 trillion bill looks a little different from the legislation originally approved by the House. Provisions for increasing the minimum wage to $15 were struck down by the Senate parliamentarian, and the income eligibility for stimulus payments was narrowed.

[What’s in the Senate’s $1.9 trillion covid bill: Checks, unemployment insurance and more]

Americans with income below a certain threshold — $75,000 for individuals, $112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for couples filing jointly — will each receive $1,400 per person as a direct deposit or mailed check. Households will receive an additional $1,400 for each dependent claimed on their most recent tax filings.

At $1,400 per individual, this will be the largest stimulus check yet for most Americans. The first round paid $1,200, and the second paid $600. Before the Georgia Senate runoff, Biden pushed for a $2,000 stimulus payment. His administration now considers the latest bill and the December checks to be part of the same round of stimulus, for a total of $2,000.

As with the last two payments, some Americans will get a partial check if their income is above the threshold. However, these amounts will phase out much faster than in the past two coronavirus relief bills. That means that some Americans who received money in the first two rounds of checks won’t get anything this time.

The narrowed eligibility was a concession from Biden to moderate Democrats, whose votes were needed for passage of the bill in a closely divided Senate.

Dependents will get the same amount as adults. The first round gave just $500 per child dependent vs. $1,200 for adults, while the second round gave $600 checks to both. Dependents that are 17 or older are also included in this round of stimulus.

In addition to the stimulus checks, the massive economic package extends unemployment benefits into September, increases the child tax credit, and reserves billions for state and local aid, coronavirus testing and vaccinations, and other provisions such as rental aid and food assistance.

35,"Capitals, Wizards receive approval to host fans inside Capital One Arena","The Nationals, whose season began Tuesday, were initially allowed 5,000 fans per game, about 12 percent of Nationals Park’s capacity. They will be permitted to host more than 10,000 fans at 25 percent capacity, officials said Friday.

United can bump capacity at Audi Field from 10 percent to 25 percent for its first home match April 17 — approximately 5,000 fans.

On Monday, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said the city was likely to ease capacity restrictions on entertainment venues and some other attractions in May, citing progress with vaccines and a plateau in daily coronavirus caseloads. But she offered scant details about Capital One Arena, suggesting fans could be back “soon.”

In discussing the waiver with Monumental, local officials worked with the city’s health department, which emphasized the need for limitations on where fans could congregate in the arena. This meant limiting the time frame concessions are available, among other safety measures, to encourage distancing, according to a D.C. government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

The city aimed to boost capacity at Nationals Park after reviewing data that showed Metro ridership to a recent home game was only about 600 people, the official said.

“It was important to understand how people were going to get to the stadium,” the official said. “So we didn’t increase risk as they were traveling to the game.”

Max Scherzer, Washington’s starting pitcher on Opening Day, praised the return of fans to Nationals Park earlier this week but expressed confusion about the crowd size.

“I don’t understand why they wouldn’t let fans in the upper deck,” he said at the time. “I don’t understand why we can’t have more fans here. Somebody’s got to explain that to me because that doesn’t make sense to me whatsoever. So I understand that we need to be safe. I respect the virus. But we can also have fans in the top part of the deck. We can have more fans in here safely. So I would love an explanation and, like I said, that’s all I’ll say.”

The announcement from local officials came as the Capitals, Wizards and Nationals are on the road. The Capitals next play at home Tuesday against the Philadelphia Flyers. The Wizards will next play in Washington on April 16, when they face the New Orleans Pelicans.

The Nationals will next play at Nationals Park on Thursday. In a statement, the Nationals said they would expand capacity starting with that game. ″As the vaccination rate increases across the region, we look forward to welcoming more fans in the future,” the team said.

The decision to expand capacity at sporting venues across the city came nearly a month after the D.C. government initially approved fans at Nationals Park and Audi Field. For the Capitals and Wizards, the city’s approval ends an extended stretch — more than a year — without fans in Capital One Arena.

As the pandemic began in March 2020, D.C. officials recommended that “nonessential mass gatherings” be postponed or canceled. Monumental said it would follow direction from the NHL, NBA and local officials about playing games without spectators if necessary.

By March 11, the NBA had suspended its season. The NHL and other sports leagues soon followed.

One year later, most teams based in the United States have started to welcome back fans. In New York, a coronavirus hot spot during the early stages of the pandemic, professional teams were allowed a 10 percent capacity in February.

Around that time, Monumental prepared to reopen Capital One Arena. In February, the company sent an online survey to fans, gauging their interest in watching games in-person again. A month later, Monumental said it had applied for a waiver with the city to allow 10 percent capacity.

Earlier this week, though, company officials feared the teams would conclude the regular season without playing in front of fans. The Capitals’ final regular season home game is May 11; the Wizards end their regular season May 16.

“All of us [at Monumental] are disappointed with the city’s failure to grant our waiver allowing fans to attend [Capitals and Wizards] games this season,” Monumental CEO Ted Leonsis tweeted Monday. “Our staff have worked tirelessly putting in place numerous infrastructure upgrades & health and safety protocols to protect fans & staff.”

On Friday, Monica Dixon, Monumental’s chief administrative officer and president of external affairs, wrote on Twitter that the company was “grateful” that the waiver allowing fans in the arena was granted and planned to release more information on Monday.

Neil Albert, president and executive director of the DowntownDC Business Improvement District, said he understood the need to balance the health of the city’s residents and its economy, using science as a guide to promote public safety. But delays in reopening, he said, present consequences for vendors, restaurants and retail establishments that rely on spending by visitors to Capital One Arena to stay afloat. Even having 10 percent of capacity at the arena will affect the local economy, he said.

“Capital One Arena is a major economic driver for downtown and for the District of Columbia,” Albert said. “We’re anxious to see its reopening but very cognizant of the health risks involved.”",0
36,CDC ramps up scrutiny of rare post-vaccination ‘breakthrough infections’,"These cases represent a tiny percentage of the 66 million people fully inoculated, and experts say they are neither unexpected nor occurring at an alarming rate. Indeed, the rarity of the breakthrough illnesses in the context of the vast scale of inoculations reinforces the encouraging message from public health experts: These vaccines are highly effective, and their rollout has dramatically driven down the rates of sickness and death among the most vulnerable populations first targeted for inoculations.

“There’s nothing there yet that’s a red flag,” Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said at a White House news briefing Friday when asked about the breakthrough cases. “We’re obviously going to keep an eye on that very, very carefully.”

The administration, state health officials and front-line health-care workers face challenges in trying to get a clear picture of these outlier cases: The data is incomplete. Some states have not reported their breakthrough infection numbers to the CDC. Some post-vaccination deaths are still under investigation and may not be caused directly by covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

Investigators are also hampered by the scattered and often chaotic nature of the pandemic response in the United States. Genomic sequencing is critical to knowing which strain of the virus causes an infection, but positive test samples are often discarded before investigators can retrieve them. Vaccinated people may also be less motivated to get tested if they come down with a case of the sniffles — they might assume it’s just a cold rather than covid-19.

There is no singular explanation for why the virus in rare cases is not neutralized by the vaccine-induced immune response. Infectious-disease experts say the human immune system is complicated, and some people may simply have a weak immune response to the vaccine. In this scenario, it’s not the vaccine that’s the wild card, it’s the patient.

Fauci offered that explanation Friday during the White House briefing. The several deaths reported so far among people already fully vaccinated were among elderly individuals who may have had underlying health conditions and may not have mounted a strong immune response when vaccinated, he said.

“I don’t think there needs to be any concern about any shift or change in the efficacy of the vaccine,” Fauci said.

Some experts fear vaccines may be less effective against strains of the coronavirus that were first found in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. (The Washington Post)

A less-likely scenario is that mutated variants of the virus are finding ways to evade immunity induced by vaccines. Investigators generally lack comprehensive data matching specific breakthrough infections with specific strains of the virus. Although variants are taking hold in greater numbers across the country, there is no evidence that those variants are a primary driver of breakthrough infections. Nor have officials detected a change in the rate of breakthroughs as the variants have spread.

For the moment, the three vaccines authorized in the United States appear quite effective against all the well-documented variants of the virus in circulation, studies show.

Scientists are investigating the role of variants, but “currently, there is no evidence that Covid-19 after vaccination is occurring because of changes in the virus,” CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said in a statement.

The investigation of breakthrough cases and any link to specific vaccines or coronavirus variants is hindered by gaps in testing data. Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease for the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said many labs have short retention policies for virus samples — about a week or less.

“You’re out of luck. You just have to hope that the specimen is still available, and that there’s enough quantity and it was stored properly and all these other things,” she said.

Public health labs have been regularly sending information to two main public databases that serve as central repositories for genomic sequences, but they have limited information.

“You’ll have a sequence, you’ll know it was from Michigan, you’ll know when it was collected, but that’s about it, with a few other indicators,” Wroblewski said. “You won’t know if it was collected from someone who was vaccinated.”

Infectious-disease experts agree on one thing: As long as the virus is circulating easily in communities, everyone should do what it takes to limit transmission and drive down infection numbers.

“There’s nothing surprising about this,” Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said of the breakthrough infections. “These are still vaccines that are fantastically safe and effective. But 95 percent is not 100 percent.”

Advertisement

He said he fears that people opposed to vaccines will exploit the breakthrough infections to argue the vaccines don’t work.

“Would you stop wearing your seat belt because you heard somebody who was wearing a seat belt got run over by an 18-wheeler and didn’t survive?” Collins asked.

A fundamental goal of mass vaccinations is to create a collective barrier, known as herd immunity, against the spread of the virus. Individuals benefit, too, but they are not entirely immune from infection. Research suggests that vaccinated people are much less likely to pass along the virus if they are infected, but this remains under investigation, and the CDC recommends that vaccinated people continue to wear masks and engage in social distancing when around unvaccinated people who aren’t members of their household.

Story continues below advertisement

Breakthrough infections rarely result in severe illness. Randomized clinical trials last year showed that both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines had close to 100 percent efficacy at preventing hospitalization, and the vaccine rollout to more than 100 million people has confirmed it. In real-life conditions, the vaccines reduced the risk of infection by 80 percent after one shot, and protection increased to 90 percent after the second dose.

Protection should last for a while. This is a critical issue that had remained speculative in the first months of the pandemic, but has become clearer as people who have been vaccinated are tested for antibodies and other immune-system markers. A study published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine that focused on the Moderna vaccine — but with implications for other vaccines — showed that fully vaccinated people have robust levels of antibodies more than six months later. Those levels subside slowly, which suggests vaccine-induced immunity should be long-lasting. Exactly how long remains to be seen.

Although the CDC has not released national data on breakthroughs, states have started to make public what they’re seeing.

In Washington state, officials have identified 102 breakthrough cases among more than 1 million people vaccinated between February and March 20, a markedly small percentage, said Umair Shah, the state health secretary. Of 102 cases, eight involved people who were hospitalized, and two others — elderly residents of long-term care facilities — died. The majority had only mild symptoms, if any.

“Look, we have been vaccinating over 1 million people, and we know vaccines aren’t 100 percent, and it’s not surprising you would get breakthrough infections,” Shah said.

Maine has fully vaccinated 340,301 people, and 62 cases of breakthrough infections have been reported, including one person in hospice care who died, said Nirav D. Shah, director of Maine’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Maine is sequencing cases when possible, but officials are not always able to obtain the genetic material, he said. Officials have not detected any discernible pattern.

“We’re sequencing because that’s what science does,” Shah said, “not because we are seeing signs of erosion of vaccine efficacy. … 99.981 percent of people vaccinated have not experienced a breakthrough.”

In South Carolina, state officials had fully vaccinated more than 560,000 people and reported 141 breakthrough infections as of April 5. In Nevada, 58 cases have been reported in the more than half-million fully vaccinated people, according to health department data.

Oregon health authorities had identified 168 cases through April 2, including three deaths, among more than 700,000 vaccinated people. Many had asymptomatic infections; 19 were hospitalized, and most were in people older than 65 or with underlying health conditions.

Michigan reported this week that, since vaccinations began, 246 fully vaccinated people tested positive for the coronavirus and three died. Those Michigan cases were among 1.7 million people vaccinated.

Beaumont Health, which runs eight hospitals in the Detroit area, is tracking 161,000 vaccinated patients and trying to discern how many have had breakthrough infections. Nicholas Gilpin, system medical director for infection prevention at Beaumont, said it has been difficult to obtain genetic sequencing of the virus samples from the breakthrough cases. But he noted that the breakthrough cases are rarely serious.

“The ones who are sick enough to warrant hospitalization, you can count them on one hand,” Gilpin said.

The key number when it comes to breakthroughs, experts say, is the denominator — the huge number of people now inoculated.

“It’s not at all surprising that in a population of hundreds of millions of people that there would still be people who get infected, who suffer mild or moderate disease,” said Paul A. Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “What you worry about are the people who, despite being immunized, become hospitalized or die.”

Offit and others are keeping a close eye on the mutated variants, which could mutate further. His bigger concern involves the attitudes of the public.",0
37,"The GOP is Trump’s party, so ‘all Republican roads lead to Mar-a-Lago’","Arkansas gubernatorial candidate Sarah Sanders and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also have fundraisers scheduled at the club this weekend. And Saturday night, the Republican National Committee has reserved Mar-a-Lago for a 400-person banquet. The price tag for that dinner: more than $100,000, according to a person involved in the planning.

The GOP is still Donald Trump’s party. The clearest proof of that: It is still finding ways to pay Donald Trump money.

Story continues below advertisement

Since Trump left office, at least six Republican candidates have held fundraisers at the former president’s Florida properties. This weekend, there will be at least six more events put on by GOP-aligned groups.

Advertisement

The events show that Trump has maintained his status as the party’s central figure, even after the violent effort by supporters to overthrow the election results on his behalf, and a post-presidency exile in which he has rarely left his own property.

That control has allowed Trump to continue his unprecedented and lucrative business relationship with his own party. Republicans will pay Trump just to be where he is — or even, in some cases, where they hope he might be.

“We would love to see him. If he came and spoke to the group spending the weekend here, that would be great. If he came and played golf and people watched him, I mean that would be great too,” said Amy Kremer, a conservative activist who is holding a summit this weekend at another Trump property, his golf course in Doral, Fla.

Kremer, whose group sponsored the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said the group had not been told Trump would visit. But they had done everything possible to encourage it: “We’re happy to be at a Trump property, and we would absolutely love to have him.”

Trump’s business arm, the Trump Organization, did not respond to a request for comment.

Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said he was not aware of the president asking anyone to come to Mar-a-Lago. He does not need to, Miller said.

“Mar-a-Lago and Palm Beach are the center of the Republican universe right now,” he said. “All Republican roads lead to Mar-a-Lago. He’s the biggest name in politics, and everybody wants his support and endorsement.”

Before he ran for office, Trump’s hotels and clubs hosted very few political events. But that changed in 2016 — when Trump won the presidency and, in the same year, opened a D.C. hotel catering to political fundraisers.

Over the next four years, Trump’s businesses took in more than $11 million from Republican candidates and groups, turning campaign donors’ money into private revenue for the president and his family. Republican groups justified this by saying that Trump charged market rates, and that GOP donors felt comfortable on the president’s property.

Now, Trump’s company is facing a difficult moment.

Its revenue dropped sharply in 2020, due to the covid-19 pandemic and political backlash. Then many of its key business partners and vendors cut ties with the company after Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his role in the Capitol insurrection.

The company has also lost revenue from two key customers tied to Trump’s career in politics. One was the U.S. government, which had paid the Trump Organization more than $2.5 million during his presidency, often to house aides and Secret Service agents at his properties. The other was Trump’s own 2020 reelection campaign, which had spent more than $7 million since 2017 at Trump properties for rent, ballroom rentals, legal fees, and other expenses.

Story continues below advertisement

It is unlikely that the GOP groups that have held events at Mar-a-Lago this year have offset those losses.

But, for Trump’s company, they provide a reliable source of revenue in a trying time. A $100,000 dinner is a $100,000 dinner, regardless of who signs the check.

“Can campaigns and political groups actually make up what he’s losing?” said Jordan Libowitz, of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Probably not. But I expect Donald Trump to do everything he possibly can to fill that hole.”

Since Trump left office, he has spent almost all his time at the Mar-a-Lago Club, where he has both a private apartment and a new office in the club’s old Bridal Suite. The club’s members applaud him every time he shows up for dinner, and then again when he departs. Aides say he rarely feels the need to leave the grounds, except to play golf at his own club nearby.

Story continues below advertisement

So Republicans come to him.

Some just come for a meeting, to pose for a photo or video that can be shared on social media, as a political imprimatur. The bridal suite has hosted a who’s who of politicians looking for what Trump calls his “total and complete endorsement” of their plans, from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to Sen. Rick Scott to a range of senators and candidates. On Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Bill Hagerty, the Tennessee Republican, stopped by.

“We discussed a range of topics, including the border crisis, election integrity, the state of the Republican Party, and the 2022 elections,” Hagerty said. Other visitors say Trump has spoken of exacting revenge against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Republicans he believes have wronged him.

Others reserve a ballroom, hoping to coax him into an appearance by setting up within walking distance of his home and his office. The price tag for these recent events is unclear: Campaign spending records for 2021 have not been filed yet, and the campaigns themselves declined to say.

“If you want him to attend your event, your best chance is to have it at the club,” said one current Trump adviser, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment frankly. “He’s not looking to travel all over.”

The six candidates who have paid to reserve a ballroom at Trump’s clubs include Sen. Mike Lee (Utah), Gov. Ron DeSantis (Fla.), Gov. Kristi L. Noem (S.D.), Alabama Senate candidate Linda Blanchard and Ohio House candidate Max Miller. Sanders, the candidate for Arkansas governor who served as Trump’s press secretary, held one event at the club a few weeks ago, and is coming back for the second this weekend.

Republicans say one benefit of these visits is that they can meet Trump’s Florida friends and club members — all potential donors. At Miller’s fundraiser, held at Trump’s West Palm Beach golf club, Trump spoke for at least 30 minutes, a person said, and packed the room with his Florida acquaintances.

“Not the traditional Republican donor set,” a person with knowledge of the event said.

Another benefit of these events for his fans is the chance to see Trump himself.

“Honored to have received a surprise visit from President Trump at my event this weekend!” Blanchard wrote on Twitter after Trump dropped by her Mar-a-Lago fundraiser in March. “I can’t wait to build on the MAGA Agenda and deliver results for the people of Alabama!”

That event showed, however, that showering Trump with money is no guarantee of his support.

Three weeks after Blanchard rented the room at Mar-a-Lago, Trump endorsed one of her opponents: Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.). Brooks was a vocal supporter of Trump’s false claims about the 2020 election, and Trump’s failed effort to overturn it.

This weekend’s events at Mar-a-Lago began Thursday, when the Conservative Partnership Institute — a group led by Trump’s former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows — held a dinner to open a two-day summit at the club. Trump’s lengthy speech followed an introduction by DeSantis. Trump spoke about frustration with “RINOs” — Republicans in Name Only — the southern border with Mexico and Biden’s failures there, Trump’s false claims of fraud in the 2020 election and voting law efforts, while telling donors to support CPI, a person with knowledge of the speech said.

On Friday, Florida lobbyist Brian Ballard is hosting a lunch fundraiser for Rubio at Mar-a-Lago. Tickets go from $2,900 to more than $10,000, according to an invitation reviewed by The Washington Post. Trump endorsed Rubio on Friday morning and may attend the lunch himself, an organizer said, though the former president had not formally committed.

On Saturday night, the RNC will bring more than 400 people to the club. The committee is holding a larger donor retreat at a nearby Four Seasons resort — but it moved this dinner to Trump’s club. That was a friendly but expensive gesture from party Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, made at a time when Trump was publicly criticizing the party.

Republican officials said that many of the donors wanted to go to the club, and that McDaniel is also meeting privately with Trump while in Florida. DeSantis is again expected to be onstage with Trump Saturday night, the only elected official slated to speak alongside the former president.

Also this weekend, Kremer’s group — Women for America First — is hosting 200 people at Trump’s Doral course. Kremer said she did not know how much it would cost. Among the speakers: Trump ally Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who is now under federal investigation into whether he maintained a sexual relationship with an underage girl. Gaetz has denied any impropriety.

On Thursday, the women’s summit began with a golf tournament. There was no promise that Trump himself would visit, making the 73-mile trip from Mar-a-Lago.

But among attendees, there was hope.

They were his fans. This was his business. Why wouldn’t he?

“It would be awesome if, during this time frame, he crashed the party,” said Dana Daniel, an attendee from Georgia.

“That would be so awesome!” said Bay Cagle, another attendee, pumping her fists in the air. Cagle sang the national anthem at the Jan. 6 rally in Washington, but said she returned to her hotel room afterward and did not participate in the storming of the Capitol.

“I hope that he does crash the party,” Daniel said.

Unfortunately for her, Trump remained at Mar-a-Lago, where he spoke to the other conservative group that had pined for a visit from the former president.",0
38,"Covid-19 live updates U.S. cases involving Brazil variant on the rise, according to CDC data","France’s national health advisory body recommended Friday that people under 55 who have already received a first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine should be given an mRNA vaccine as their second dose.

“If you have received a first injection and are under 55 years old, you will be offered another vaccine 12 weeks after the first injection,” Health Minister Olivier Véran said Friday on French radio.

A mixed vaccination approach remains largely untested in late-stage trials in the context of this pandemic, and the independent National Authority for Health, known as HAS, recommended a study to track its efficacy. The advice came three weeks after the HAS recommended that anyone younger than 55 should not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine, amid concerns over rare blood clots as a possible side effect that has been primarily observed in younger people.

France was one of several countries that halted or restricted vaccinations with the AstraZeneca product in recent weeks. Earlier this week, British authorities said people younger than 30 would be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca vaccine.

In France, about 500,000 people under 55 had received a first dose of the vaccine before the age limit was imposed there. France’s age limit for the AstraZeneca vaccine has meant that the country’s vaccination campaign focusing on the elderly now relies more heavily on that vaccine, even as it faces plummeting trust among the French.",0
41,"As rainstorms grow more severe and frequent, communities fail to prepare for risks","Earlier that summer, more than seven inches of rain drenched the county, setting off flash flooding. Six days later, swollen rivers flowing south from Wisconsin crested at record heights. Families evacuated. More than 3,000 structures flooded. Damage exceeded $12 million.

Where Wisconsin saw jobs and tax revenue, Illinois saw a rising threat. “We realized there were significant storm-water concerns,” said Kurt Woolford, the interim executive director of the Lake County Stormwater Management Commission. “Water doesn’t follow political boundaries, it doesn’t follow state boundaries.”

But rainfall estimates used to design storm-water desigsystems do. As they analyzed whether the plans for Foxconn could handle extreme rain, officials in each state reached different conclusions. In Illinois, they relied on a 2020 state study that predicted as much as 8.57 inches of rain would fall, causing floods. But Wisconsin officials disagreed, citing a 2013 study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that forecast just 5.84 inches.

The conflict highlights the lack of a comprehensive, national precipitation database as climate change brings more frequent “rain bombs” that can dump up to seven inches of water in hours. Design standards for roads, storm-water systems, dams and construction regulations — even whether a home is in a flood plain and requires flood insurance — are based on precipitation estimates. In many states, those standards no longer accurately portray the risk to infrastructure intended to last decades.

“It is foundational to so many decisions that we make,” said Chad Berginnis, executive director of the Association of Floodplain Managers. “It’s a risk problem that has ripple effects everywhere.”

Last year, the United States saw a record 22 weather events that cost at least $1 billion each in damages. Seven were hurricanes, according to NOAA.

Many states rely on rainfall estimates, known as Atlas 14, that are produced by the NOAA. But data for Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia have not been updated since 2006. And in the Pacific Northwest, Oregon and Washington state have never sought an Atlas 14 estimate; those states are using 1961 data from an earlier study.

Some localities, including Broward County, Fla., and Virginia Beach, have funded rainfall estimates leading to higher design standards. But rural and poorer communities are unable to afford such studies.

“It’s kind of the Wild West out there,” Berginnis said. “Some communities get it, and they’re planning for it. And some communities don’t [get it].""

Illinois is one of those places that gets it. The state’s 2020 rainfall update at the heart of the dispute over the Foxconn project found that not only had rainfall jumped by 13 percent over the previous study 30 years earlier, but it would continue to increase.

A study commissioned by Lake County concluded that the combination of Wisconsin's outdated rainfall projections and inadequate storm-water detention for the development of Foxconn in that corridor between Chicago and Milwaukee would mean a two-foot increase in flooding along the Des Plaines River, one of four snaking south from Wisconsin through Lake County. “It was a big eye-opener for us,” Woolford said, “because we usually don't think about what happens in other states.”

Story continues below advertisement

Mark Glaudemans, director of the National Water Center Geo-Intelligence Division at NOAA, does the Atlas studies. He said the rainfall projections for Wisconsin were accurate when they were published in 2013. But, he added, the dispute over Foxconn highlights the need for a comprehensive nationwide survey.

“Anytime you stop a climatology-based study at a political boundary that does not reflect the natural conditions, of course, you’re going to have boundary issues,” he said. “That’s why we are in favor of a national study.”

Researchers at the University of Wisconsin in 2019 found design guidelines based on Atlas 14 were dangerously inadequate. Looking at records from more than 900 weather stations from 1950 to 2017, they determined that 100-year storms, those with a 1 percent chance of occurring in a year, were happening almost twice as often in the eastern half of the country as Atlas 14 predicted.

“The take-home message is that infrastructure in most parts of the country is no longer performing at the level that it’s supposed to because of the big changes that we’ve seen in extreme rainfall,” said Daniel Wright, a hydrologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and co-author of the study.

He points to the 2014 National Climate Assessment that found heavy downpours had increased 71 percent in the Northeast, 37 percent in the Upper Midwest, and 27 percent in the Southeast since 1958. It may cost more initially to build for bigger storms, but it’s less expensive than making fixes later, said Constantine Samaras, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Carnegie Mellon University.

“The place that we want to get to is designing for the future rather than designing for the past,” he added.

Story continues below advertisement

But the increasing number of extreme storms means the past is not a reliable predictor of the future. “So if you’re building a house to last for 30 years, or a piece of infrastructure to last for 50 to 100 years, you’re basing it on out-of-date data from the get-go,” said Alice Hill, who served in the Obama administration as a special assistant preparing for climate change. “And that’s doomed to failure because these events are accelerating.”

Engineers interviewed say it’s well known that Atlas 14 is often outdated. But if it’s required by a state or municipality, it dictates design — even for projects intended to last 50 years or more. C.J. Bodnar worked in the private sector before becoming a city engineer with Virginia Beach in 2015. “You did what you needed to meet the requirements, which means you used Atlas 14,” Bodnar said. “You were trying to keep your client’s costs to a minimum.”

Not only are the NOAA estimates often outdated, they also do not estimate increasingly extreme storms driven by climate change. NOAA plans to include those projections in future Atlas updates. “We are aware that we need to do this,” Glaudemans said.

Updating rainfall estimates is cheap compared with storm damage. Texas paid NOAA $1 million for a 2018 update that officials say nearly doubled the number of homes at flood risk in Houston and Austin. The year before, Hurricane Harvey dumped 60 inches of rain, leaving more than 100 dead and causing an estimated $125 billion in damages.

In 2018, an advisory panel of engineers, hydrologists and meteorologists from the Army Corps of Engineers, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and NOAA recommended federal funding of rainfall estimates every 10 years and the creation of a national extreme precipitation database. “This small investment,” it said, “would result in significant return and benefits for infrastructure design in the United States.”

Bipartisan bills pending in Congress would fund NOAA updates of precipitation frequency at least every five years and estimates of maximum precipitation every 10 years. The House version would also require NOAA to include future fluctuations in precipitation because of climate change.

Armed with better data, some local and state officials have been able to make sweeping — albeit costly — infrastructure design changes to better protect their communities.

After Hurricane Harvey, Texas sought an updated Atlas 14 from NOAA.

The update revealed a dramatic rainfall spike in the eastern half of the Lone Star state. NOAA increased the estimated rainfall for a 100-year storm in Texas from 13 inches to 18 inches. What’s more, what had been considered a 100-year storm was now a more frequent 25-year storm, NOAA found. And a 500-year storm became the equivalent of a 100-year storm.

“I think that what we’re doing [now] provides a much better understanding and appreciation of the risk that we have here,” said Craig Maske, the chief planning officer for the Harris County Flood Control District, which includes Houston.

The county increased requirements for rainfall detention on sites, raised the elevation standard for new structures by two feet, and increased storm sewer capacity requirements by 10 percent for storms forecast to occur every two years and by 22 percent for 100-year storms. The majority of homes damaged by Harvey were outside of designated floodplains. Now, engineers expect the sprawling county, the third-largest in the United States, will add 162 square miles to its flood-plain map.

The updated rainfall estimates resulted in design changes to road projects already underway in Harris County, increasing their cost by at least $148 million. The revised plans elevate roadways by as much as five feet, enlarge detention ponds, increase storm-water pipelines, and strengthen bridges. Among them is Interstate 45, a main hurricane evacuation route. The Houston-Galveston Area Council, which oversees road projects in the county, estimates the cost to redesign the infrastructure could rise by an additional $100 million. “It's going to be a hard pill to swallow right now, but I think ultimately it'll be good for the region,” said Adam Beckom, the manager of planning and project development at the council.

Houston isn’t the only Texas city to see dramatic changes in the updated rainfall estimates. Predictions for what is known as the 100-year storm in Austin increased from three inches within 24 hours to 13 inches. Storms previously considered 100-year-events are now 25-year events. The number of homes in Austin’s floodplains increased to 7,200 from 4,000.

“The challenge is the rain in many of these places is getting heavier. And the amount of pavement that rain is falling on, it’s getting bigger,” Samaras said. “So it’s kind of a double whammy. You have less places for the rain to go into the ground, you have more rain, and you have the same old sewer pipes from 30 years ago.”

In Virginia Beach, where sea levels have been rising at twice the global rate, Hurricane Matthew lingered over the area in 2016 to deliver a knockout punch, the third 100-year storm of the year. The rainfall topped 14 inches in some neighborhoods. It followed a storm two weeks earlier that dropped 12 inches. Areas that had never before flooded were submerged. In the Windsor Woods section of the city, about 250 homes were damaged, 85 percent of them without flood insurance, according to the city manager. Throughout the city, about 2,000 buildings suffered $30 million in damage.

The city hired Dewberry, an engineering consulting firm, to perform a $3.8 million study of its storm-water management. The firm found that heavy rainfall had increased at about 7 percent per decade since 1950, more than doubling the rate of the previous decades. And the city’s design standards, based on outdated Atlas 14 projections used by the state, underestimated the amount of future extreme rainfall by about 20 percent, the consultants said. (Broward County’s study reached the same 20 percent underestimate conclusion.)

Last summer, the city council strengthened design standards for building elevations and calculating storm-water runoff. If it didn’t act, the city could see $271 million annually in flood losses from sea level rise by 2065, according to Dewberry. Some developers objected to the changes, citing increased costs.",0

43,First-grader wrote Old Navy asking for girls’ jeans to have real pockets. The letter went viral.,"“They were fake pockets,” said Kamryn. “It bothered me that they weren’t real pockets.”

So she penned a letter explaining her position. She had practice writing persuasive letters from a class assignment, and decided to put her writing skills to use in the real world.

“I wrote to them because I would like a place to put my hands and a place to hold my stuff,” said Kamryn, a first-grader at Evening Star Elementary. “I want my pants to have real pockets like my brother’s pants.”

Old Navy actually wrote back, and a proud Bentonville school district posted both letters on its Facebook page. Hundreds of people responded.

Oh, the power of persuasion especially when you're adorable! Earlier this year, first graders at Evening Star Elementary... Posted by Bentonville Schools on Thursday, April 1, 2021

“Pockets are important!” wrote one woman.

“Way to go, Kamryn! Keep speaking up for girls!” wrote another.

“I’m 56 and love front pockets! Not every girl lives w/ a purse at their side,” added a woman from Florida.

It was mid-January when Kamryn decided to put her concerns in a letter after learning the art of persuasive writing in school, said her mother, Kim Gardner, who also teaches at the school.

“She’d been voicing her frustration to me and her dad that her Old Navy pants had pockets that were sewn shut,” said Kim, 36.

Kamryn figured that she was ready to write a letter pointing out the pocket discrepancy because she had practiced her persuasive writing technique on her parents earlier that month, she said.

“I wrote them a letter that I wanted a camera and an Etch a Sketch, but it didn’t go so well,” Kamryn said.

Her mom told her that it would be a good life lesson to send a handwritten letter to Old Navy about her pocket-size problem, so Kamryn sat down one afternoon and neatly wrote her request with a pencil on ruled paper:

“Dear Old Navy,” she wrote. “I do not like that the front pockets of the girls jeans are fake. I want front pockets because I want to put my hands in them. I also would like to put things in them.

“Would you consider making girls jeans with front pockets that are not fake. Thank you for reading my request. Sincerely, Kamryn Gardner, age 7.”

When her mom read the letter out loud, her brother, Landon, 9, said he thought it was just right.

“It was very persuasive,” he said. “I’ve never had this problem [of no pockets]. But I’ve heard my sister talk about not having pockets all the time.”

Before Kim Gardner mailed the letter, she said she told her daughter: “Let’s see what happens. We’ll have to wait now and see if they’ll write back.”

“We honestly thought it would end there,” said Kamryn’s dad, Brandon Gardner, 38, who works in the retail industry.

“We just want our kids to learn to use their own voices and solve problems,” he said. “We didn’t think we’d hear from Old Navy, and that if we did, it would be a generic email.”

Last month, the entire family was surprised to find a package from Old Navy addressed to Kamryn when they returned home from spring break in New Mexico, said Kim Gardner.

Her daughter was excited to get two new pairs of Old Navy shorts and two pairs of pants with real pockets, along with a handwritten note from Julie Wood of Old Navy’s kids’ team.

“Kamryn, thank you so much for taking the time to write to us about pockets on girl’s jeans,” Wood wrote. “The Old Navy kids product team appreciate your information. It’s great feedback as we develop new product. In appreciation, please accept some girls bottoms for you to enjoy.”

Kamryn was so excited to hear back that she took the note and the pants to school on show-and-tell day, she said.

“The girls in my class are really happy about it,” she said. “They like pockets, too.”

Kamryn’s teacher, Ellie Jayne, said she expected nothing less from a girl who loves soccer and climbing and regularly comes up with creative ways to celebrate holidays and her friends’ accomplishments.

“Kamryn doesn’t brag on herself, but she is excellent in everything she does,” Jayne said. “She has a big, fun personality and always speaks her mind.”

Although Old Navy does carry several varieties of girls’ pants with pockets, the company will keep Kamryn’s request in mind as additional styles are developed, said company spokeswoman Sandy Goldberg.

“Our design and product teams love hearing feedback from customers, especially young people like Kamryn, and we take suggestions into consideration as we work on future products,” Goldberg said.

Kamryn said after she opened her package from Old Navy, she especially appreciated her new Old Navy shorts that are embroidered with tiny white daisies.

“They’re really cute,” she said. “But mostly, I just really like the pockets.”

44,We can’t go to a bar now. So these NYU grads simulated one — and it’s wildly popular.,"Clubhouse is known for rooms where people swap stock tips, chat sports or even moan like whales. This particular room was started by a group of recent New York University grads who felt the app was too dry and tech-focused.

Story continues below advertisement

Their temporary “bar” is more of an interactive comedy show, a mixture of improv, podcast and dating game. It’s a popular example of the many “shoot your shot” Clubhouse rooms, where people pitch themselves as romantic prospects, friends or even job candidates to others in the room.

Advertisement

The hosts are “onstage,” riffing and joking with one another. Anyone in the audience who wants to offer to “buy a drink” for another member of the audience clicks the “raise hand” button. There are no actual drinks, of course, but if chosen, they get to shoot their shot by pitching themselves as a prospect, plus they get interviewed (and, perhaps, a bit roasted) by the hosts.

The show really took off the night Tesla CEO Elon Musk logged in and drew so many people to the app that the servers crashed, stranding everyone in whatever room they were already in.

Story continues below advertisement

“We had a room with 800 people stuck in it, listening to us,” said co-host Devin Lewtan. “This was before we had a name, and people started tweeting things like, ‘I’m listening to these NYU girls roasting tech guys. What is this?’ ”

The name was born, and an audience was found. Their next show drew about 4,700 listeners. Since then, it has attracted guests including B.J. Novak, Diplo and Clubhouse founder Paul Davison.

As with a real night out, the unpredictability breeds excitement. At one point during a recent simulation, a guy asked someone named Angela if he could buy her a drink, and she responded, “I just joined Clubhouse and I have literally no idea what’s going on right now.”

At another point a man named JT, who came live from the Sheraton Tribeca Hotel, bought a virtual drink for co-host Mare Arundel. He joked that because she’s an NYU girl, “your standards for men are probably through the floor.” His promise: to take her to a real bar called Lucy’s for some $3 PBRs.

Story continues below advertisement

Arundel said she “can’t do” PBRs, but she’s going to take him up on it and order straight shots.

The mixture of giddy vulnerability and sharp improv can be an intoxicant, a solid replacement for the kind you’d normally be purchasing throughout a barhopping evening. Many of the men “pitching” truly sound nervous when admitting that they box or consider themselves hot.

The show can bleed into the real world. One woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss her romantic life, found herself in the simulated bar and spotted a woman she’d previously dated and still had feelings for. Things had fizzled out, but she remained hopeful. Imagine her excitement when said ex got “onstage” and asked to buy her a virtual drink … and perhaps a real one.

Story continues below advertisement

“It was so nerve-racking,” she said. “I have no idea what I even said. I was trying to play it cool, and I was like, ‘Yeah, we should go on a date.’ ”

The two rekindled the romance and even attended another episode of the show during their Valentine’s Day date.

Because the events happen in real time and aren’t recorded, these sort of can’t-miss moments keep the crowd coming back week after week.

“If all my friends are in a room that’s never going to be recorded or played back, I’m going to want to be there,” said co-host Sarah Jannetti. “It plays into FOMO.”

Advertisement

Plus, audience members answer live Twitter polls and text with each other in a separate chat platform. “They’re building their own community within our room, without our audience,” said co-host Page Stein.

Story continues below advertisement

For those who choose not to participate and prefer just to listen, there’s an almost voyeuristic feeling, like you’re seeing what other people act like on dates — all the different types of performances hopeful romantics try on for size.

A major part of the room’s appeal, of course, is the fact that we haven’t been able to go out and gather in large groups for more than a year. In Normal Times, a simulation might seem like a quaint experience. But during a lockdown, Lewtan — like so many others — enjoyed gathering in a virtual room with people whom she wouldn’t likely meet in real life.

The crew wonders about the show’s future as the world reopens — it’s considering branching out into other forms of social media — but the room fills a need for now.

“Right now, our event is really fun because it simulates a fun night in New York or anywhere,” Lewtan said. “What happens when a simulation is no longer necessary?”",0
45,The best ways to achieve crispy bacon,"For me, the epitome of this cured pork product is audible crispiness. You might be a fan of some chew or tenderness, which is fine by me because that’s your business, but I want there to be a snap and a crunch each time a strip passes my lips. For those of the same mind-set, here are two methods to produce just that.

Stove top

Tried and true, this is the way I learned to cook bacon: Lay the strips in a cold skillet, place over medium-low to medium heat, flip and fry until you reach your desired doneness and then transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. The key is to slowly render the fat to achieve bacon’s character-defining crispness. Unless you walk away from the stove while cooking — which you should not be in the practice of doing outside of a handful of situations anyway — this method produces superior results every time.

When it comes to skillet choice, nonstick or cast iron are my recommendations. I prefer a good nonstick skillet for more even heating and thus cooking, but some love the nostalgia of bacon frying in a cast-iron skillet, which is also a great way to season it from time to time. (And just a reminder about one of the myths of cast iron: While it is great at heat retention, it is a poor conductor, meaning that it will heat unevenly, leading to hot spots and varied textures in the bacon.)

You may have heard of the water method, and you may be wondering about its merits. For those not in the know, the editors at Cook’s Illustrated recommend adding enough water to cover the bacon in the skillet at the start, which leads to a “crispy and tender bite.” While it does produce a slightly less shatteringly crisp end result, I didn’t notice enough of a difference to champion this method over cooking it naked.

The main downside to the stove-top method is the quantity of bacon that you can cook. Unless you have a large griddle that fits across multiple burners, a skillet can only hold enough strips to feed two, maybe three, bacon-loving humans. Plus, if you are prone to get distracted easily and don’t want to stand near the stove, there’s risk of the pork belly going from beautiful to burned in no time at all. That’s where the oven comes in.

Oven

Plain and simple, this is the best way to cook bacon for a crowd — or just any time you want to take a more hands-off approach. Lay the bacon on a rimmed baking sheet and place it in the oven until it’s cooked to your specifications. There’s isn’t even any need to flip it.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

I first encountered this method as a line cook, when we would make trays upon trays of bacon each brunch service. I have memories of placing a layer of parchment on each rimmed baking sheet, on top of which freshly cut strips of bacon were shingled just a bit (to fit more onto each pan) in the wee hours of the morning before the first diners arrived. The parchment paper is solely for easier cleanup, and I’ve used it when baking bacon ever since. (Daniela is a fan of foil for the same reason.) If there’s sufficient overhang, either can leave a perfectly unsoiled pan underneath, but if you don’t mind putting in some work and would rather not create more waste, cooking the bacon directly on the sheet pan is an option.

Considering a baking rack? I say don’t. Cooking it on a rack leads to meaty instead of crispy bacon, which is not what we’re after here. Plus, then you have the task of cleaning it, which I often find to be a real pain.

As for the oven temperature, it mostly comes down to how long you’re willing to wait. The package currently sitting in my fridge instructs a 375 degree oven, which yielded my ideal of perfectly crisp, regular-cut bacon after about 25 minutes. I’ve gone as low as 350, but any lower than that and the wait becomes too long. J. Kenji López-Alt recommends 425 degrees, which he says takes 20 minutes for crispy bacon, but he doesn’t recommend going much higher than that. “Cooking at 475 left me with bacon that was threatening to burn in spots and still undercooked in others after just 15 minutes,” López-Alt wrote. (Pro tip: There’s no need to preheat the oven.)

Both methods lead to incredibly crisp bacon, and the choice of which to use mostly comes down to how much you want to make. If your ideal bacon is more limber or has a bit more chew, you may prefer a different method. There are several ways to go, and that’s completely up to you.

Regardless of the method you choose, the one rule that you must abide by is to always save the fat. That liquid gold is full of flavor and it’s great for cooking vegetables, making vinaigrettes, frying chicken and even baking breads and desserts. Just pour the bacon grease into a metal or glass jar, pop it in the fridge (it should last for at least three months) or freezer (where it keeps indefinitely) and grab it whenever you want to add a boost of bacony flavor to whatever it is you’re cooking.",0

47,"In new book, John Boehner says today’s GOP is unrecognizable to traditional conservatives and dishes on his time in politics","“That was fine by me because I’m not sure I belonged to the Republican Party he created,” Boehner writes in “On the House: A Washington Memoir,” set to be released Tuesday.

Story continues below advertisement

In the epilogue, Boehner flatly states that he is glad to be out of elective politics given the party’s sharp distancing from its onetime heroes.

“I don’t even think I could get elected in today’s Republican Party anyway. I don’t think Ronald Reagan could either,” he writes in the book, a full copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post.

The memoir, coming 5 1/2 years after he left Congress, serves as a rollicking, foul-mouthed recounting of Boehner’s 25 years on Capitol Hill, as well as his thoughts on the past, present and future of the GOP. Although he never held office during the Trump years, Boehner sets the stage for how the Republican Party ended up with the former real estate developer turned reality TV star as its standard-bearer.

Originally finished well before the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, as Congress certified President Biden’s victory, Boehner rewrote portions of the book to forcefully blame Trump for what he called “a low point for our country” that left him on the verge of tears.

“Trump incited that bloody insurrection for nothing more than selfish reasons, perpetuated by the b------- he’d been shoveling since he lost a fair election the previous November. He claimed voter fraud without any evidence,” Boehner writes.

He draws a direct line from anti-establishment lawmakers he dealt with last decade to Republicans in Congress who supported Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election: “The legislative terrorism that I’d witnessed as speaker had now encouraged actual terrorism.”

Boehner has delivered a classic Washington “tell-all,” albeit one with his typical jocular style. His image on the book cover — smiling in a suit, holding a glass half-full of red wine and a lit Camel cigarette in an ashtray — conveys his old-school approach to politics.

Story continues below advertisement

There’s some bit of praise for almost everyone, mixed in with digs about their politics. Everyone except Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.). Boehner has nothing but harsh words over Cruz’s actions dating back to a 2013 federal government shutdown where the Texan played a starring role.

Advertisement

Congressional politics has grown only more coarse since Boehner left in October 2015 after serving four years as speaker, ending his battle to maintain power as a couple dozen conservatives rebelled against his leadership.

Now fully ensconced in the influence industry — Boehner serves on several corporate boards and is a senior adviser at the law firm Squire Patton Boggs — he goes out of his way to defend several of the most reviled institutions in Washington: bureaucrats Trump called “the deep state; lobbyists that Trump dubbed “the swamp”; and a press corps that Trump labeled the “enemy of the people.”

Story continues below advertisement

Although he addresses serious topics of the present and the past, Boehner makes clear his goal was not to write a “15-point plan to save the world” but an entertaining account of his time in public life.

“Get comfortable. Pour yourself a glass of something nice. You’re going to enjoy this,” Boehner writes, concluding the introduction.

What follows are some of the most notable parts of his memoir:

Boehner meets Trump

Boehner’s first impression of Trump, then a reality TV star, provided an early glimpse of Trump’s quick temper.

Boehner met the future president during a golf outing at Trump National in Westchester, N.Y., when he joined Boehner and two insurance executives for a round. He doesn’t say the date, but notes he was House minority leader then, so this encounter would have been between 2007 and 2011.

Story continues below advertisement

Before they set off, Trump asked a young Boehner staffer the names of the executives.

It was only after 18 holes that the two men summoned the courage to tell Boehner and Trump that they’d been calling them the wrong names all day. Boehner laughed, but Trump turned angry. “This sort of glower fell across his face,” Boehner writes. Then Trump got in the staffer’s face and berated him.

Advertisement

“What are you, some kind of idiot?” Trump shouted. “You want to know how to remember somebody’s name? You f-----g LISTEN!”

There “was something dark about” Trump’s reaction, Boehner observed.

“I’d never seen anybody treat a staffer like that — not in politics, not ever,” Boehner writes. “This was more than New York bluster. This was real anger, over something very, very small. We had no idea then what that anger would do to our country.”

Boehner on Pelosi

At several points in the book, Boehner compares himself to Nancy Pelosi, of whom he speaks with a mix of reverence and distaste for her leadership style as speaker.

Story continues below advertisement

In the first chapter, Boehner recalls when Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) dethroned Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) as chairman of the powerful House Energy Committee. Pelosi (D-Calif.) officially stayed neutral, but Boehner said that “she was all over this. I could just smell it.”

Advertisement

“Pelosi had gutted Big John Dingell like a halibut she found floating around San Francisco Bay, then calmly sat back and had a cup of coffee afterward. His entrails were left on display for everyone in the House of Representatives to see — and to remember,” Boehner writes. “I don’t think Nancy relished mounting Dingell on her wall — she certainly didn’t brag about it — but that’s not the point. The point is she did it, and I have no doubt she slept just fine that night.”

Boehner later describes how Pelosi kept an “iron grip” on her members, not tolerating any “dissension in her ranks.”

Story continues below advertisement

“Even if I wanted to, I could never operate like Pelosi did,” he writes. “The fact was, I didn’t want to act that way, even though sometimes other people thought I should.”

House GOP shouldn't have impeached Clinton

Boehner regrets his support for impeaching President Bill Clinton in 1998 because the House Republicans’ motives were purely political, he writes.

Advertisement

“I know what we all said at the time: Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath. In my view, Republicans impeached him for one reason and one reason only . . . Tom DeLay believed that impeaching Clinton would win us all these House seats, would be a big win politically, and he convinced enough of the membership and the GOP base that this was true.”

Story continues below advertisement

Boehner acknowledges that he supported the move at the time, but in retrospect doesn’t think Clinton’s behavior rose to impeachment charges.

“Clinton probably did commit perjury. That’s not a good thing. But lying about an affair to save yourself from embarrassment isn’t the same as lying about an issue of national security,” Boehner writes.

House Republicans’ gambit backfired and they lost five seats in the midterms that year.

Mark Meadows on his knees

Before he was Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows was a thorn in Boehner’s side while serving as a Republican congressman from North Carolina.

Advertisement

As founder of the Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right Republicans, Meadows was often in Boehner’s way.

Boehner had campaigned for Meadows in his first election, but in one of Meadows’s first actions as a freshman congressman, he voted against Boehner for speaker — “a vote that like many of the Freedom Caucus’s efforts ended in abject failure,” Boehner writes.

Soon after, Meadows asked for a private meeting. Within a few minutes in Boehner’s office, the congressman “dropped off the couch and was on his knees. Right there on my rug. That was a first. His hands came together in front of him as if he were about to pray,” Boehner recalls. He asked Boehner to forgive him.

“I was so startled I can’t remember exactly what the hell he was saying. For a moment, I wondered what his elite and uncompromising band of Freedom Caucus warriors would have made of their star organizer on the verge of tears, but that wasn’t my problem,” Boehner writes.

So Boehner took a “long, slow draw” of his cigarette and left Meadows there on his knees waiting. Then, after an extended silence, Boehner looked down at him asked, “For what?”

Boehner said he forgave him, but knew Meadows wouldn’t hesitate to cross him again.

His time as the 'mayor of Crazytown'

Boehner was effectively cast out as House speaker thanks to a revolt among the more extreme elements of his conference. And his memoir is unsparing when it comes to his contempt for those members.

Boehner reflects that even after becoming speaker, he saw where the party was going. He calls 2008 GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin “one of the chief crazies” in the party but says he understood Sen. John McCain’s motivation in picking her as his running mate to fire up the base.

Boehner says he was already living in “Crazytown,” and “when I took the Speaker’s gavel in 2011, two years into the Obama presidency, I became its mayor. Crazytown was populated by jackasses, and media hounds, and some normal citizens as baffled as I was about how we got trapped inside the city walls. Every second of every day since Barack Obama became president I was fighting one bats — t idea after another.”

Boehner’s disregard for these elements has been well-established — and particularly his disdain for the man he describes as the ringleader of the tea party movement. In a Politico op-ed adapted from the book last week, Boehner describes how birtherism and other maladies infected his party, and in audio leaked from his audiobook recording sessions he directs vulgar insults at Cruz.

Boehner urged people who want to actually fix Washington to “send people there to represent you who actually want to get things done instead of hucksters making pie-in-the-sky promises or legislative terrorists just looking to go to Washington and blow everything up.”

Tough verdict for McCain

Palin isn’t the only member of the 2008 GOP presidential ticket who Boehner criticizes.

To be clear, he professes admiration for McCain (R-Ariz). But he also casts him as out of his element and over his skis when it came to a late gambit in the 2008 presidential race to suspend his campaign and insert himself into a bank bailout bill, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), during the financial crisis.

“Then almost out of nowhere, Senator John McCain decided to pop in. This was the last thing anyone needed — including, as it turned out, John himself,” Boehner writes, adding that McCain should have stayed on the campaign trail.

He says McCain showed up without any actual ideas. He said he asked the GOP presidential nominee what the plan was, only to have McCain turn the question on him. When he asked McCain what he planned to say in a key meeting, he says McCain asked him what he should say.

“If I’d had a cigarette in my mouth, I might have swallowed it,” Boehner said, adding: “Now it was clear: there wasn’t anybody who was going to get us out of this mess.”

On the 'Deep State' and lobbyists

The former speaker blasts Trump’s accusations that bureaucrats within agencies such as the Justice Department and CIA were part of a “massive conspiracy against America.”

“There is something very destructive — not to mention delusional — about the notion that there is some plot deep within the nation’s capital — in the FBI, in the federal courts, in the intelligence community — to undermine democratically elected officials,” he writes.

Boehner defends lobbyists as “educators” who have expertise on many issues, even if the nature of their work seems to make them political villains.

“If you listen to the lobbyists, you’re going to know exactly what that language you are voting on actually does, and how it affects real people,” writes Boehner, who works with lobbyists but has never registered as one.

Cigarettes and alcohol

Two of Boehner’s trademarks during his time in Washington were his smoking habit and his love of a good glass of red wine. In his memoir, he tells the tale of both.

When Boehner was 19 years old he weighed 273 pounds and was teetering close to a size 40 pants. Determined to lose the weight, he came up with a diet plan: Three meals a day and a cigarette in between whenever he felt hungry.

Everyone smoked then, even pregnant women, he writes, “so give me a little bit of a break, please.”

He lost 85 pounds, trading bad eating habits for the lifelong bad habit of smoking.

And the wine?

Boehner explains it wasn’t always his beverage of choice, particularly growing up in a shot-and-beer tavern outside Cincinnati, Andy’s Cafe, named after his grandfather.

“Once you start to get a little older, beer just fills you up too much with all that carbonation. Too much bloat. So then, as a ‘young professional,’ I switched to old fashioneds,” he writes, explaining how sugar and bitters softened the bourbon. “But if you’ve got a long night ahead of you, you usually find that drinking liquor for several hours is pretty much unsustainable. Plus, nothing that sweet can be good for you in the long run. And so I settled on wine. Drinking wine is a marathon, not a sprint, and makes sense for the more mature drinker.”

48,Book review of On the House: A Washington Memoir by John Boehner,"Boehner’s more than three decades in public life coincide with his party’s rise to national majority status during the 1980s and ’90s — powered by Ronald Reagan’s takeover of one end of Pennsylvania Avenue and Newt Gingrich’s of the other — followed by its degeneration into a vehicle for White grievance that, as a clearly dismayed Boehner describes it in this unvarnished account, borders on the psychotic. “I was living in Crazytown,” Boehner writes of his years leading the House Republicans in the 2000s. The House Republican Conference was “a clown car I was trying to drive.” His party’s loss of the White House in 2008 only made things worse. “Every second of every day since Barack Obama became president, I was fighting one bats--- idea after another.”

There’s an odd and poignant disconnect between the book’s tone and its unsettling subtext. The voice is warm, engaging, occasionally profane — that of a guy who just plopped down on a bar stool next to you, fortified with a glass of his beloved merlot and an unfiltered Camel (both of which feature prominently in Boehner’s portrait on the cover of the book), to tell you about a bunch of interesting people, most of whom he genuinely likes, and an amazing career that he’s still pinching himself to make sure he really had.

It’s as if Boehner himself hasn’t quite processed the transformation of the sunny “morning in America” Republicans he joined in the 1980s into the dark conspiracy theorists who dog-whistled a mob to the Capitol on Jan. 6.

The former speaker doesn’t equivocate when it comes to laying the blame for that. Donald Trump “incited that bloody insurrection for nothing more than selfish reasons,” Boehner writes, adding, “It was especially sad to see some members of the House and Senate helping him.”

His assessments of other members of what he dubs “the Knucklehead caucus” are, if anything, more withering.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) is the “head lunatic.” Two House conservatives turned senior Trump administration officials, Mick Mulvaney and Mark Meadows, get lumped under the sobriquet “jackass.” Former congressman Steve King (R-Iowa), a leader of the GOP’s anti-immigrant wing, is “an a--hole.” Former representative Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), now the dean of the school of government at Regent University, was “a kook” (whom, Boehner confides, he nonetheless steered to the House Intelligence Committee to keep her off the tax-writing Ways and Means panel). The false “birther” theories fomented about Obama by Republicans and conservative talk show hosts were “truly nutty.”

Boehner’s disdain for the ideological purists who took over his party and eventually drove him to resign the speakership and his House seat in 2015 is not exactly breaking news: He called for Trump to resign after the Jan. 6 putsch and rehearsed many of his book’s themes in a lengthy 2017 Politico Magazine interview with Tim Alberta, now with the Atlantic. Still, having his excoriating assessments collected between hard covers makes for a powerful indictment, the more so because Boehner’s book vividly captures the growing horror of a bartender’s kid who evolved from a reflexive Democrat to a Reagan Republican to a tea party whipping boy.

Boehner describes one trip he made to New York to meet with “my longtime friend, Roger Ailes.” He says he pleaded with the then-head of Fox News “to put a leash on some of the crazies he was putting on the air.” In response, he says, Ailes stunned him by sharing a series of complex conspiracy theories involving Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the financier George Soros, and confiding that he had a “safe room” where the government couldn’t spy on him. “I walked out of the meeting in a daze,” Boehner writes.

Recalling his frantic efforts to round up enough Republicans to approve President George W. Bush’s emergency bailout bill in 2008, as the world teetered on the edge of financial collapse, Boehner says that too many of his colleagues “cared more about what Sean Hannity thought than the secretary of the Treasury.”

Boehner, who says Reagan inspired him to make his first run for office — a 1981 campaign for a seat on his local township board — insists that today’s GOP has abandoned them both. “I don’t even think I could get elected in today’s Republican Party,” he writes, “just like I don’t think Ronald Reagan could either.”

Arriving in Congress in 1991, Boehner was, by his own description, a bomb-thrower. As a freshman, he upset (deservedly) leaders of both parties by inveighing against the corrupt House Bank and “earmarks” — special deals that powerful lawmakers worked to get funding for pet projects in their districts. Boehner joined the Conservative Opportunity Society, the first in a series of increasingly ideological GOP sub-caucuses. The difference between that and today’s Freedom Caucus, Boehner says: “We even worked with and liked many members of the opposition party.”

That and some schooling from former president Gerald Ford, a longtime House member whom Boehner bonded with over their mutual love of golf, turned the young Turk into a seasoned dealmaker.

By his own account, Boehner’s signal accomplishment as a member of Congress was the No Child Left Behind Act. Bush signed the landmark legislation in 2002 after intensive negotiations with Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) and the equally liberal Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.). Boehner, then the head of the House Education and Labor Committee, delivers a blow-by-blow account of how the unlikely foursome worked together to foil efforts to torpedo the deal by ideologues in both of their parties, including Bush’s vice president, Dick Cheney. It was arguably the last major piece of social legislation to win wide bipartisan support in Congress.

His biggest disappointments, Boehner says, were failures to reach similarly sweeping pacts on immigration and spending with Obama. While he puts a good deal of blame on the former president, who, he writes, “could come off as lecturing and haughty,” Boehner also recognizes that he was often not in the best negotiating position. The takeover of his GOP conference by “far-right knuckleheads” who were “radicalized by blind Obama hatred” would have made it hard for him to deliver votes.

A onetime opponent of legalized marijuana, Boehner now serves on the board of a cannabis company. So far, he says, he hasn’t inhaled, but “I’m not ruling it out.” For Boehner, opportunity and personal chemistry have always trumped ideology. One of the book’s most tantalizing stories is about how, in 1996, Boehner initiated a secret negotiation to have Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia give up his lifetime appointment to become Bob Dole’s running mate on the GOP presidential ticket.

Boehner, who was convinced that this would be just the thing to vault Dole over Bill Clinton into the White House, describes trying to cut the deal in a backroom of A.V. Ristorante, an unprepossessing D.C. Italian joint since shouldered aside by the fancy development along the New York Avenue corridor. It’s an interesting thought experiment, to say the least, to consider how history might have changed had Dole not gone with Jack Kemp and instead created another vacancy for Clinton to fill on the nation’s highest court. But for Boehner what mattered was how he and his new friend — “Call me Nino” — bonded over red wine and an anchovy and pepperoni pizza.

The old-school pol was not without blind spots. On summertime cross-country bus trips with other Congress members to campaign and raise money for promising GOP candidates, golf clubs and fishing rods were always packed in the hold, and, Boehner writes without a hint of embarrassment, there was just one rule: “No girls allowed on the bus.” Good luck to the women who wanted to rise up the ranks of House GOP leadership. This may partially explain why there have always been so few of them.

Mostly, Boehner is clear-eyed about his weaknesses and knows how to compensate for them. He describes how he used “colorful language that probably wasn’t appropriate” to chew out Washington Post columnist Karen Tumulty — then a congressional correspondent for Time magazine — after she asked him a pointed question as he emerged from a private meeting that hadn’t gone well. The remorse was immediate, particularly after he saw she was pregnant. “I apologized to her right then and I apologized pretty much every time I saw her for the next ten years,” he writes.

Boehner makes no apologies and offers no explanations for failing to call out his party’s destructive elements sooner. He says the GOP will have to purge itself of a faction that now includes “everyone from garden-variety whack jobs to insurrectionists” if it wants to survive. “I hope to do my part, even in retirement,” he adds. Boehner offers no plan for how to accomplish this. But he does have one recommendation for American voters: “You can vote to send people there to represent you who actually want to get things done instead of hucksters making pie-in-the-sky promises or legislative terrorists just looking to go to Washington and blow everything up,” he writes.

We can all raise a glass of merlot to that.

49,GOP 2022 candidates tout Trump’s ‘stolen election’ claims,"But even more notable is this: There is no such problem on the opposite side of the debate — and far from it. In fact, when it comes to the most contentious recent event in Republican Party politics — baseless claims of a stolen election — the crop of GOP candidates emerging in key Senate and governor’s races is significantly more extreme than even those they’re running to serve alongside.

As with Greitens and Schmitt, there are degrees here. Claiming massive voter fraud is different from arguing, as the ill-fated Supreme Court lawsuit did, that states didn’t conduct their elections in accordance with the law (though neither had merit, according to the courts). Similarly, while most of these GOP candidates have supported Trump’s claims in various ways, some such as Mandel have chosen to make them a focal point of their campaigns, while others have more generally highlighted their support for Trump after having previously promoted his false claims.

But the unifying characteristic is the extent to which the GOP talent pool — or at least the part of it that is now seeking promotions — is dominated by those who toed Trump’s line to one extent or another, often going further than the GOP senators and governors whom they would replace or join. Indeed, there are very few high-profile candidates thus far who didn’t do that to at least a significant degree.

Another key open Senate seat is in North Carolina, where the GOP primary is still shaping up. But it’s soon expected to include Rep. Ted Budd, who signed a letter in the days after the election asking the Justice Department to investigate voter fraud and irregularities, including “particularly in the vote counting process” — a long-standing baseless claim of those alleging a stolen election. Current candidate Rep. Mark Walker also joined most House Republicans in signing on to a lawsuit seeking to overturn the election — after his name was initially left off the list.

In Alabama, Brooks’s biggest early opposition comes from Lynda Blanchard, a former ambassador in the Trump administration who last month criticized a voting bill in the state by citing abuses “that allowed the recent presidential election to be stolen from President Trump.”

An early test of Republicans’ formidability in 2022 will come in 2021, when Virginia holds an open gubernatorial race. In that primary, GOP candidates have emphasized “election integrity” rather than direct claims of fraud in 2020, but they’ve also strained to avoid saying President Biden won legitimately. And one leading contender, state Sen. Amanda F. Chase, called those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 “patriots” — earning a historic censure from the state Senate, including from some Republicans.

In Nebraska, a leading early contender for governor is former Trump campaign adviser Charles Herbster, who actually attended the “Stop the Steal” rally on Jan. 6 before the Capitol riot.

Arkansas’s 2022 gubernatorial race, meanwhile, is between Trump’s former top spokeswoman in the White House, Sarah Sanders, who has in the past defended Trump’s bogus claims of widespread fraud, and another attorney general who joined in the Supreme Court lawsuit, Leslie Rutledge.

In the Alaska Senate race, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) has drawn GOP opposition from former state administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka, who after the 2020 election cited “many credible allegations and documented incidents of fraud, voter oppression and voting irregularities.”

While many of these races are only now getting off the ground, it has become evident who thinks they have a future in the near term in the GOP — especially when contrasted to the incumbents who have criticized Trump and decided that they don’t.

But many of these candidates have said, and are saying, things that even many incumbent senators and governors didn’t, leaving the GOP to figure out whether it wants these baseless claims and extremism to infect its party’s elected wing even more than it already has.",0
50,"What is the filibuster? Its meaning, history and why Democrats want to change it now.","For everything else, there’s a big hurdle in the way of Democrats’ legislative priorities: the filibuster.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

The question of what to do about the filibuster — whether to leave it intact, modify it or get rid of it completely — is an intense one that has probably been sidelined as of this week. Any change would require the votes of all 50 Democrats in the Senate, and one of them, Sen. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, said on Wednesday that “there is no circumstance” in which he’d vote to change or eliminate it.

That statement, in an op-ed Manchin wrote in The Washington Post, was about as purposefully unequivocal as it gets for a politician. It wasn’t out of line with his previous statements, but it seems to slam the door for now on Democrats’ hopes of moving on the items that Republicans won’t go for — which are most of their priorities.

Because of that, we’re likely to still hear a lot about the filibuster. So let’s explore exactly why it’s the most important rule in politics right now.

What is the filibuster?

The filibuster is a Senate rule that essentially requires 60 votes to pass most legislation (for example, the measures Democrats can’t get through using reconciliation, like a minimum-wage increase or immigration reform).

The Senate is required to follow certain procedural steps in passing legislation. When a bill is brought to the Senate floor, any senator can bring things to a halt by speaking for as long as they wish, effectively delaying a vote to end debate on a bill. The Senate can vote to end debate by invoking cloture — another procedural step — with a three-fifths majority, or 60 of 100 senators. So any bill that has the support of at least 60 senators is, in effect, filibuster-proof, and the Senate can quickly move on to the next steps leading up to a final vote. But without 60 senators (remember, Democrats only have 50 right now), the filibuster cannot be broken.

In the modern Senate, an objecting senator doesn’t actually have to stand there and filibuster endlessly — you might remember Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) reading “Green Eggs and Ham,” or Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) quoting Jay-Z and Wiz Khalifa, in the midst of hours-long speeches that brought the Senate to a standstill. Those moments weren’t technically filibusters, because the “talking filibuster” was eliminated decades ago. They were more temporary delay tactics, with cloture votes taking place soon afterward. But they give a good sense of what talking filibusters were like — typifying the long, seemingly pointless speeches that characterized senators’ attempts to delay legislation in the talking-filibuster era.

So now, a senator can simply indicate his intent to filibuster a bill and cause it to be sidelined. That means, in the current Senate, all it takes is one Republican to object to a Democratic-sponsored bill and that bill is stopped in its tracks before ever getting to a final floor vote.

Democrats are facing renewed pressure to end or change the legislative filibuster, but The Fix’s Aaron Blake explains why that’s unlikely. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)

How the filibuster has changed in recent years

Legislation is the last big area of Senate business to which the filibuster applies. It used to apply to judicial nominations, but Democrats voted to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominations except for Supreme Court justices in 2013, and Republicans followed up by eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court justices in 2017.

Democrats made that first big change in 2013 after Republicans held up the nominations of dozens of Obama administration officials that needed Senate confirmation, as well as nominees for federal judgeships. Getting rid of the filibuster for those nominees was seen as a huge departure from Senate tradition — but Democrats paid for it once Republicans took back the Senate a year later, then won the presidency in 2016. That set up then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to confirm hundreds of federal judges during the Trump years, without needing 60 votes. And in 2017, eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees enabled the GOP to put three conservative justices on the court, after refusing to consider Obama nominee Merrick Garland.

President Trump's remaking of the federal judiciary follows a three-decade period of rising partisanship — and hypocrisy — over federal judicial nominees. (JM Rieger/The Washington Post)

That’s put the Senate on a trajectory toward slowly returning to majority rule, and the last big hurdle is legislation. Democrats have been considering eliminating the legislative filibuster since well before they won back the Senate in January — including during the 2020 election — and it’s a discussion that is getting louder as they get closer to moving beyond the kind of bills they can pass through reconciliation.

The case for changing it now

Democrats who want to change the filibuster caution that they might have a limited window to pass the legislation they want ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Midterms are scary for the party in power. Traditionally, midterm elections lead to losses in Congress for the party holding the White House. If Democrats lose either the House or the Senate in 2022, passing big-ticket legislation during Biden’s first term is essentially off the table.

So, they say, why not use every tool available to pass new laws now? They have the majority and the procedural power to do it. And, proponents argue, it’s a lot harder to undo existing legislation once it’s already in place (see: the Affordable Care Act).

Democrats also seem to expect little in the way of bipartisan cooperation — or even real negotiations — on big-ticket bills.

The case for keeping it the same

There are a few cases for keeping the filibuster as it is now. Manchin, in signaling he won’t vote to change it even if the rest of his Democratic colleagues do, says it’s about forcing the kind of bipartisan cooperation that has become rare in the Senate.

“The time has come to end these political games,” Manchin said on Wednesday, criticizing the kind of partisan procedural maneuvering that has become the norm in the Senate, “and to usher a new era of bipartisanship where we find common ground on the major policy debates facing our nation.”

McConnell, now the minority leader, made a similar argument in March.

“The framers designed the Senate to require deliberation, to force cooperation and to ensure that federal laws in our big, diverse country earn broad enough buy-in to receive the lasting consent of the governed,” McConnell said.

There’s also the fact that Democrats probably won’t control the chamber forever — perhaps not even for the remainder of Biden’s term. Republicans having full power and no filibuster could result in all sorts of Democratic nightmares — abortion rights rollbacks chief among them. Groups such as Planned Parenthood are reportedly wary of changes that could hand Republicans the ability to enact national antiabortion policies the next time they win the White House and both chambers of Congress.

McConnell’s ability to confirm federal judges at will during the Trump administration was a real thorn in Democrats’ sides, and some regretted starting filibuster reform in 2013. McConnell has promised to bring the Senate to a complete standstill with procedural maneuvers if Democrats gut the filibuster.

“Nobody serving in this chamber can even begin to imagine what a completely scorched-earth Senate would look like,” McConnell said on March 16. “I want our colleagues to imagine a world where every single task … requires a physical quorum, which, by the way, the vice president does not count in determining a quorum.”

McConnell is basically saying that if Democrats gut the filibuster, Republicans will make the Senate unbearable. They’ll make it a pain to do things as simple as turning on the lights.

Proponents of changing the filibuster say that only serves to force Democrats to make concessions to Republicans who aren’t that interested in negotiating in the first place.

Is nuking the filibuster totally off the table now?

After Manchin’s announcement — which left him little wiggle room to change his mind — filibuster reform is dead for now. Manchin has carved out a space for himself as the most moderate Democrat in the Senate, occasionally infuriating those in his party who see him as stopping their agenda cold.

But it isn’t just Manchin — there isn’t even a cohesive plan from Democrats at this point.

Biden has said he wants a return to the talking filibuster but wouldn’t be drawn in on whether to change the number of votes needed to end debate — something Manchin already shot down.

“I don’t think that you have to eliminate the filibuster. You have to do what it used to be when I first got to the Senate back in the old days,” Biden said on March 17. “You had to stand up and command the floor, you had to keep talking … so you’ve got to work for the filibuster.”

But it’s not Biden’s vote that really matters — first, Democrats would need all 50 Democratic senators onboard. And several have been vocal in opposing big changes beyond Manchin, including Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.).

“When you have a place that’s broken and not working, and many would say that’s the Senate today, I don’t think the solution is to erode the rules,” Sinema told the Wall Street Journal. “I think the solution is for senators to change their behavior and begin to work together, which is what the country wants us to do.”",0
51,The Daily 202: Democrats wonder what Manchin means when he won't 'weaken' the filibuster.,"Manchin did that this week with a Washington Post op-ed laying out his position on the filibuster, a parliamentary tactic that effectively means most legislation in the Senate needs 60 votes to pass.

“There is no circumstance in which I will vote to eliminate or weaken the filibuster,” he wrote.

Manchin had shouted his opposition to ending the filibuster before. Literally, as Biden might say.

So it’s the “weaken” part in his recent op-ed that appears to deserve more scrutiny. What would qualify as weakening that parliamentary stalling tactic, and therefore something Manchin opposes?

His spokesperson did not return an email seeking clarity on that question.

A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to detail behind-the-scenes conversations, declined to join me in speculating what Manchin’s “weaken” might mean.

“The question of where he’s willing to do carve-outs, that’s a question for him,” the official said.

Manchin has long centered his political identity on his opposition to certain ideas.

When he ran for Senate in 2010, his most memorable ad — possibly the most memorable ad by any candidate in that cycle — centered on him loading a rifle and shooting Democratic cap-and-trade legislation to battle climate change in what must be the clearest “I won’t support this” message in modern politics.

Story continues below advertisement

In the commercial, Manchin also promised he wouldn’t tolerate erosions of Second Amendment rights, wouldn’t automatically go along with President Barack Obama’s administration, and wouldn’t let “the bad parts of Obamacare” remain law.

Advertisement

A decade later, here was Manchin promising in November 2020 he wouldn’t support progressive Democrats’ calls to add justices to the Supreme Court if his party swept Georgia’s two Senate races and controlled the chamber.

""With packing the courts, I'm not voting for that,"" Manchin told CNN.

In February 2021, Manchin vowed not to support Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package unless it had Republican support.

""I will only support moving in a bipartisan way,"" he said.

(It didn’t work out that way, but not before Manchin surprised fellow Democrats by saying at the last minute he would not go along with their extension of unemployment benefits, forcing changes to the bill.)

He also doomed Neera Tanden’s nomination to run the Office of Management and Budget. “I cannot support her,” he said in a statement.

More recently, he signaled that he wouldn’t support Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill if his party relies on a parliamentary tactic called reconciliation allowing them to pass the legislation without any GOP support.

“I'm not going to do it through reconciliation. I am not going to get on a bill that cuts them [Republicans] out completely before we start trying,"" he told Axios.

This is all a touch simplistic, of course. Manchin often gets attention for things he supports, like voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court or to make William Barr attorney general — or vote to convict Donald Trump in both of his impeachment trials.

But it helps to explain why students of Manchine politics (go ahead and groan) study his statements of opposition closely. And that includes his latest salvo.

Advertisement

Some Democrats have pushed for creating a limited exception to the filibuster rules for legislation on civil rights and voting matters, my colleagues Amy Gardner and Mike DeBonis reported last month.

That would appear to qualify as “weaken” for Manchin, since his latest op-ed proudly underlined his 2013 opposition to exempting nominations to Cabinet-level posts and federal judgeships, and vote against making Supreme Court nominations a simple-majority question in 2017 — both effectively carve-outs.

What about Biden’s push, in his March 25 news conference, to return to the days when senators actually had to talk to prevent a bill from advancing?

“It used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. And guess what? People got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. Filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote,” Biden said. “I strongly support moving in that direction.”

Advertisement

In early March, Manchin seemed to suggest he held a similar view during an appearance on Fox News Sunday.

“The filibuster should be painful. It really should be painful. And we have made it more comfortable over the years, not intentionally. Maybe it just evolved into that,” he said. “Maybe it has to be more painful. Maybe you have to stand there.”

Story continues below advertisement

He had much the same message on NBC’s “Meet The Press.”

“If you want to make it [filibustering] a little bit more painful, make him stand there and talk, I'm willing to look at any way we can,” Manchin said. “But I'm not willing to take away the involvement of the minority.”

What’s happening now

Biden will today unveil a commission to study possible expansion of Supreme Court. The bipartisan commission comes amid liberal calls for expansion to blunt the court’s conservative majority,Tyler Pager reports. The commission will include as many as three dozen people and fulfill Biden’s campaign promise to study changes to the court.

Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin’s trial continued this morning with a forensic pathologist saying George Floyd’s death was due to “the activities of the law enforcement officers.” “Lindsey Thomas, a consulting forensic pathologist in Minneapolis, told prosecutors that Floyd’s passing was ‘not a sudden cardiac death,’” Timothy Bella reports. “She said the officers, and their restraint on Floyd, were ‘the mechanism for inadequate oxygen.’”

Biden and First Lady Jill Biden paid tribute to the late Prince Philip, who passed away at 99. ""The impact of his decades of devoted public service is evident in the worthy causes he lifted up as patron, in the environmental efforts he championed, in the members of the Armed Forces that he supported, in the young people he inspired, and so much more,"" the Bidens said in a joint statement.

The first 100 days

Biden’s “skinny” budget is here.

The document dropped late this morning and asks lawmakers for $1.5 trillion in federal spending for fiscal year 2022. It's the president's first budget request and will be followed by a more formal plan in the spring.

But we can learn some things from this proposal, which greatly increases discretionary spending for education, health care and the environment.

The Education Department's budget would rise 41 percent , with most of the new money going to high-poverty schools. HHS would get a 23 percent boost, with $8.7 billion going to the CDC in the highest amount allocated to that agency in two decades. And public housing programs would get a 15 percen t boost to $69 billion.

Big price tag: Remember, Biden's budget request comes after the recent enactment of the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill and his desire for a sweeping infrastructure plan is expected to cost about the same amount.

The budget does not include tax proposals or mandatory spending for Social Security and Medicare, the Times. per the Times.

The administration seeks $715 billion for the Pentagon, a modest increase from the current level, Politico reports . “That planned fiscal 2022 budget topline is up from the more than $704 billion allocated by lawmakers for this fiscal year. But it’s unlikely to satisfy factions of Republican defense hawks seeking to continue major increases in military spending, and progressive Democrats who want to enact steep cuts to the defense budget.”

The future of the GOP

Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who is under a federal investigation related to sex-trafficking laws, will speak at a conservative women’s conference at Trump’s golf resort.

Gaetz is scheduled to speak tonight at the event hosted by Women for America First, Jaclyn Peiser and John Wagner report . The group of conservative women helped orchestrate the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol riots.

Leaders of the group have defended Gaetz’s appearance, saying he is “innocent until proven guilty.” Gaetz has denied allegations he had an inappropriate sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl.

Others scheduled to appear at the “Save America Summit” include Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.).

Only one Republican House member — Illinois’s Adam Kinzinger — has officially called on Gaetz to resign.

“‘Matt Gaetz needs to resign,’ Kinzinger said in a tweet in which he attached a news report about 2018 Venmo transactions between Gaetz and accused sex trafficker Joel Greenberg, Wagner reports

“While Kinzinger is calling on Gaetz to leave Congress, top House Republican leaders, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney (Wyo.), have had little to say about the matter. Last week, McCarthy said that Gaetz should be removed from the House Judiciary Committee if the allegations prove true but noted that Gaetz had denied wrongdoing.”

Trump and an array of other 2024 Republican hopefuls are converging on Palm Beach, Fla., this weekend for an RNC donors retreat.

“Much of the gathering will be held at the Four Seasons Hotel in Palm Beach, but donors are scheduled to convene at Trump’s private Mar-a-Lago Club for a portion of the program on Saturday, when he is expected to speak,” Wagner reports

“Others eyeing 2024 White House bids who are expected to appear include former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem and Sens. Tom Cotton (Ark.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Rick Scott (Fla.).”

Jonathan Martin and Nicholas Fandos report for the Times on the “gravitational hold” Trump still has on the GOP. The result, confusion about what the GOP stands for: “R epublicans have embraced fights over seemingly small-bore issues to make a larger argument: By emphasizing the withdrawal from publication of a handful of racially insensitive Dr. Seuss books; the rights of transgender people; and the willingness of large institutions or corporations like Major League Baseball and Coca-Cola to side with Democrats on voting rights, the right is attempting to portray a nation in the grip of elites obsessed with identity politics,” writes the Times. “R

In his new memoir, former House speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) says today’s GOP is unrecognizable.

The party, Boehner writes, is being held hostage by both Trump and a “conservative media echo chamber that is based on creating ‘chaos’ for its own financial needs,” Paul Kane, Colby Itkowitz and Aaron Blake report

Boehner said he was happy to be away from Washington when Trump was inaugurated, saying he wasn’t sure he “belonged to the Republican Party [Trump] created.” “I don’t even think I could get elected in today’s Republican Party anyway. I don’t think Ronald Reagan could either,” he writes in the book.

“At several points in the book, Boehner compares himself to Nancy Pelosi, of whom he speaks with a mix of reverence and distaste for her leadership style as speaker,” our colleagues note. “Boehner later describes how Pelosi kept an ‘iron grip’ on her members, not tolerating any ‘dissension in her ranks.’ ‘Even if I wanted to, I could never operate like Pelosi did,’ he writes.”

More notably, perhaps, is that Boehner regrets his support for impeaching Bill Clinton.

“I know what we all said at the time: Bill Clinton was impeached for lying under oath. In my view, Republicans impeached him for one reason and one reason only,” Boehner writes, “Tom DeLay believed that impeaching Clinton would win us all these House seats, would be a big win politically, and he convinced enough of the membership and the GOP base that this was true.” The gambit backfired as Republicans lost five seats that year.

In retrospect, he writes, Clinton’s behavior didn’t rise to impeachment charges. “Clinton probably did commit perjury. That’s not a good thing. But lying about an affair to save yourself from embarrassment isn’t the same as lying about an issue of national security,” Boehner writes.

Quote of the day

“The legislative terrorism that I’d witnessed as speaker had now encouraged actual terrorism,” Boehner writes in his book, drawing a direct line from anti-establishment lawmakers he dealt with last decade to congressional Republicans who supported Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election.

The pandemic

Trump officials celebrated efforts to change CDC reports on the virus, emails show.

There are more shots available in the U.S. The rising challenge, though, is getting people to take them.

“When it comes to getting the coronavirus vaccine, Mississippi residents have an abundance of options. On Thursday, there were more than 73,000 slots to be had on the state’s scheduling website, up from 68,000 on Tuesday,” the Times’s Andrew Jacobs reports . ""But public health experts say the pileup of unclaimed appointments in Mississippi exposes something more worrisome: the large number of people who are reluctant to get inoculated.”

“Though access remains a problem in rural Mississippi, experts say that the state — one of the first to open eligibility to all adults three weeks ago — may be a harbinger of what much of the country will confront in the coming weeks, as increasing supplies enable most Americans who want the vaccine to easily make appointments.” In Mississippi, only a quarter of all residents have received at least one dose compared to the nationwide average of 33 percent. Other southern states, including Tennessee and Georgia, have similarly low rates of vaccination.

“A closer look at Mississippi’s demographics explains why hesitancy may be especially pronounced. The state reliably votes Republican, a group that remains highly skeptical of the coronavirus vaccine... Another factor in the state’s low vaccination rate may be Mississippi’s large Black community. ... Vaccine hesitancy remains somewhat high among African-Americans, though the doubts and distrust ... have markedly declined in recent months.”

Trump endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio’s (R-Fla.) reelection bid for a Senate seat his daughter Ivanka eyed. Trump offered his “Complete and Total Endorsement” to Rubio, calling him a “a tireless advocate for the people of Florida” in a statement that cited his support during Trump’s presidency for cutting taxes, protecting gun rights and funding the military, Wagner reports.

The Senate Leadership Fund, a PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), is backing the reelection of Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), whom Trump has vowed to defeat, Wagner reports. “The PAC’s endorsement comes in the wake of last week’s announcement by Republican Kelly Tshibaka, who leads the Alaska Department of Administration, that she will try to unseat Murkowski next year.

Hunter Biden, in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, said the story on his laptop was a “red herring” and called out Donald Trump Jr. The younger Biden, who was there to promote his new memoir, was introduced as “probably the most famous board member of a Ukrainian energy company of all time.” Kimmel, replying to his guest’s claims that he could not remember dropping off the laptop at a Delaware repair shop, said that seems hard to believe “unless you read the book. Then it’s like, I’m surprised you have shoes on.” “It is absolutely a red herring,” Biden said. “But I am absolutely, I think, within my rights to question anything that comes from the desk of Rudy Giuliani."" Biden also defended his former role in the board of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company, citing his résumé and saying he’s been on the boards of other organizations before. Kimmel asked Biden if it makes him “crazy” when people like Trump Jr. say he’s only been successful because he’s Joe Biden’s son. “It is wildly comical,” Biden said. When Kimmel asked him if he has ever met Trump Jr., Biden said, “Not that I know of,” before adding, “But I’ve been in some pretty rough places.”

Biden, on his second day in office, told his administration to prepare an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay a $15 minimum wage and provide emergency paid leave. Biden has said he will issue that order within his first 100 days in office, at the end at this month.

That’s good, but not enough for the Center for American Progress Action Fund and its allies, the National Employment Law Project, the Service Employees International Union and the Communications Workers of America.

“There is more to be done,” the Action Fund declares in a new report titled “Service Contract Workers Deserve Good Jobs.”

The “more to be done” includes increasing the minimum wage with inflation and providing sufficient benefits for contract workers, stronger protections for those with disabilities, and better enforcement of workplace rights, the group says. Doing so, advocates argue, will boost one of Biden’s top goals — greater racial equity.

With the government’s broad reach, raising the minimum wage for federal contract workers would influence other sectors and “will help correct long-standing racial and gender disparities, since women as well as African American and Latino workers are overrepresented in many service contract industries,” the report says.

Walker, 66, of Bogalusa, La., and Collier, 58, of Hattiesburg, Miss., answer questions from callers to the 1-800-MEDICARE hotline, sometimes taking 40 to 60 calls a day. Walker said she is paid $13.10 an hour, the same wage as when she started seven years ago. Collier makes even less, just $12.22.

Both are working to organize a union with CWA and said during a telephone interview that their work is rewarding but leaves them financially strapped.

“We don’t get enough pay for what we do,” Walker said. “That’s not a living wage. It’s difficult to support myself.”

Reluctantly, Walker has occasionally relied on food banks, saying, “I feel so ashamed, really, having to go.”

Walker and Collier make too much for government assistance, but too little to live comfortably. Collier said she’d like to buy new clothes, go to dinner with her husband and fix her house. “I can't do that now,” she added, “because it's a struggle.”

It’s a struggle aggravated by the government’s understandable preference for hiring the lowest bidder on federal contracts. But lowball bidders exacerbate the problem of low wages, “especially when you're dealing with services where what you're really buying is human labor,” said Anastasia Christman, director of the Worker Power Program at the National Employment Law Project.

Story continues below advertisement

“The only way to always be driving that price lower is to be exploiting the workers who do it,” added Christman, who wrote the report along with Karla Walter, senior director of the American Worker Project at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

Legislation is needed to raise the minimum wage nationally, but Biden can use executive action to impose a higher wage for federal contract workers, as he has indicated he plans to do.

Doing so would meet conservative opposition and “unnecessarily drive up taxpayer costs for federal services and take away job opportunities from individuals with disabilities,” said Rachel Greszler, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “The federal government should provide competitive compensation, commensurate with what the private sector offers, but taxpayers shouldn’t be forced to overpay for federal services.”

Story continues below advertisement

Overpaid? Walker and Collier beg to differ. Even the association representing contracting companies isn’t opposed to the higher wage.

David J. Berteau, president and CEO of the Professional Services Council, said in an email that “too many contracts are awarded based solely or primarily on the lowest cost for the government. In fact, awarding contracts to the lowest-priced bidder is a root cause of low wages for contract workers, because the biggest factor of price in services contracts is labor costs, both direct and indirect,” with the last sentence partially in bold for emphasis.

“It doesn’t have to be that way,” he added, also in boldface. Acknowledging the additional costs that would come with a boost to the minimum wage, he said “top-level guidance could be issued to the entire [federal] contracting officer workforce that it is in the best interest of the government to pay higher wages and that the government’s approach to awarding services contracts needs to reward companies that bid that way.”

Instead of paying higher wages, as many already companies do, some exploit their workers, federal investigations have found.

A Government Accountability Office report released in November said the Labor Department found Service Contract Act violations, primarily of wage and benefit protections, in 68 percent of more than 5,000 cases from 2014 through 2019.

In 60 cases, the violations were so serious that companies were excluded from new government business for three years. Employers paid $224 million in back wages.

A 2017 report prepared by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) found that more than 300,000 workers from almost 12,000 companies “have been the victims of wage related labor violations while working under federal contracts in the last decade.”

Nearly 700 of the companies were repeat offenders.

53,Iran frees South Korean ship as more nuclear talks planned in Vienna,"On Friday, South Korea also said that the ship, the MT Hankuk Chemi, had been freed, while MarineTraffic.com data showed the ship leaving the port of Bandar Abbas.

It was unclear to what extent Iran’s move was linked to the talks in Vienna, which are expected to stretch for weeks. But Iran’s demand for access to its frozen funds is part of broader negotiations over the revival of the nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.

President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed harsh sanctions. Iran, in retaliation, began increasing its uranium enrichment beyond permitted levels. The Biden administration and Iran have expressed their desires to revive the agreement but have been at an impasse as to how to do so.

Iran and the United States began indirect talks in Vienna on Tuesday. For days, European diplomats have shuttled proposals between the two delegations, holed up in two separate luxury hotels on opposite sides of a tree-lined boulevard in the Austrian capital.

Their hope is to agree to a road map that would lift U.S. sanctions imposed under Trump and recommit Tehran to its agreements under the accord, including limits on uranium enrichment.

Story continues below advertisement

Iran and signatories to the deal — excluding the United States — held formal meetings on Friday that “took stock of the discussions held at various levels” over the past days, the European Union said in a statement.

European coordinators will continue separate contacts with all participants to the deal and the United States, with meetings to take place again next week, it added.

After Friday’s discussions, the E.U. diplomat chairing the negotiations, Enrique Mora, tweeted that envoys seek to “intensify joint diplomatic efforts” next week.

A senior E.U. official said that the participants had a “shared sense of urgency.”

“This is a rather complex, but necessary, process,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. “There needs to be clarity on what it takes and what is required to return to full and effective implementation of the deal. It will take some time.”

Story continues below advertisement

Exactly which sanctions are lifted and which remain in place is expected to be a sticking point in negotiations. On Wednesday, the United States said it was willing to lift sanctions on Iran that are “inconsistent” with its 2015 nuclear deal.

Iran has stated it wants wide-ranging sanctions relief: an end to sanctions initially lifted under the accord but reimposed by Trump, as well as more than 1,500 new measures Trump levied as part of his “maximum pressure” campaign after withdrawing from the deal.

“All Trump sanctions were anti-JCPOA” and “must be removed,” Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted Friday, using the initials for the nuclear pact.

Other hurdles include how to deal with Iran’s advances in research and development know-how after it stepped up enrichment and other nuclear-related programs when Trump pulled out of the accord.

Iran has in the past strongly hinted that access to its funds in South Korea might be the kind of goodwill gesture that would break the deadlock with the United States. The money would pass through Switzerland and be restricted to purchases of humanitarian goods such as medical devices, Iranian officials have said.

Saeed Khatibzadeh, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, said the ship and its captain were released “following the completion of the investigations about violations of this vessel and the requests from the owner of the ship and Korean government.”

A South Korean Foreign Ministry official said Friday that “we firmly expressed our willpower to solve issues related to the frozen funds.” The official, who was not authorized to be named, said South Korea’s “efforts were communicated to Iran and could have positively influenced the final decision to release the seized vessel.”

It was not clear whether the Biden administration had authorized South Korea to release the Iranian funds. South Korean officials had previously said they would require U.S. agreement to unfreeze Iran’s assets.

“Iran started recognizing South Korea’s efforts to solve the frozen funds issue after realizing that it involves not only South Korea’s power and efforts but also the JCPOA negotiations,” the South Korean official said. “The captain and the crew members are in good health, and it is confirmed that the vessel including the cargo are in good conditions.”",0
54,"Volcano on St. Vincent erupts, spewing column of ash amid evacuations","Satellite images and photos shared on social media captured a thick column rising from the 4,049-foot volcano that began erupting at 8:41 a.m. Plumes of brown ash and smoke drifted higher as they moved northeast, reaching at least 38,500 feet into the atmosphere, near the altitude at which many commercial aircraft fly.

Residents posted videos showing debris falling “like rain” on parts of the island in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Officials announced a second, smaller eruption around 3 p.m..

“The ash column is starting to fall back down around the volcano,” Erouscilla Joseph, director of the Seismic Research Centre at the University of the West Indies, told The Washington Post “It is possible that there will be some property damage. This could go on for days, weeks or even months.”

In an interview with The Washington Post, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said there had been no reports of injuries or fatalities.

On Thursday, authorities announced that the threat of La Soufrière erupting was “imminent,” ordering thousands to evacuate from a danger zone on the northern end of the island. Emergency management officials issued a red-alert after scientists observed tremors on the island’s only active volcano that indicated a heightened risk of eruption as magma broke up rocks and moved near the surface.

Evacuees fled the island’s “red zone,” the area where the volcano is most hazardous, traveling in small vans and cars to emergency shelters in safer quarters of St. Vincent or boarding boats to nearby islands. Gonsalves estimated that 14,000 people were being evacuated from the area, roughly 10,000 of whom had already reached safety by Friday afternoon.

Gonsalves said, however, that there had been some “hiccups” due to clogged roads on the northeastern side of the island.

“I don’t want us to panic,” he said. “I want this to be disciplined. I want this to be orderly.”

He said the island had benefited from trade winds that appeared to be pushing the worst of the volcanic ash into the ocean. But Theresa Daniel, a spokeswoman for the country’s National Emergency Management Organization told The Washington Post that efforts to evacuate communities in the shadow of the volcano were being complicated by low visibility and debris.

“The efforts are a little stymied because of the ash flow,” she said.

Oshea Collis, 25, a resident and Red Cross volunteer in St. Vincent, said she was gathering last minute supplies when she heard the blast of the first eruption and saw the volcano disgorge a monstrous cloud of smoke and ash into the sky.

“It was like several thunder [claps] at the same time,” she said. “People were screaming as soon as it began. It was total chaos. Everything was paralyzed and people ran to their homes.”

The morning’s sunny weather, she said, had changed to a cloudy sky filled with ash.

“I am scared,” Collis said. “But I need to help more people, so I’m trying to control it.”

In a statement on social media, the Seismic Research Centre at the University of the West Indies said the ash has begun to fall on the flanks of the volcano and surrounding communities, including Chateaubelair and Petite Bordel.

The NEMO Facebook page became an impromptu window into the tense effort to evacuate nearby communities.

“Look folks the road is packed with everyone,” wrote one Facebook user, JoJo Lynn. “Small island with a large number of vehicles creates no movement in an emergency.

Gonsalves said some 2,000 people had been relocated to 20 active shelters and that more space was being made inside hotels and inns both within the country and in surrounding island nations. He fought back tears as he spoke of the assistance of nearby nations and cruise lines that were mobilizing to aid evacuees.

“It brings home that we are one Caribbean family,” he said.

In a bulletin, the National Weather Service warned pilots that volcanic ash could be present in the atmosphere, a significant hazard to aviation. The metallic filaments in volcanic ash can accrete and melt on turbines, choking engines and threatening aircraft.

The plume was tall enough to spark volcanic lightning, with several plume-to-ground strikes hitting the waters west of the island, up to five miles away from the volcano. Satellite imagery confirms that most material associated with the plume was drifting east-northeast and would likely pass north of Barbados.

The National Hurricane Center in the United States also issued an ashfall advisory for mariners.

Royal Caribbean and Carnival Cruise Lines provided ships to evacuate Vincentians off the island, which arrived at port on Friday. Gonsalves said that several neighboring island nations, including Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada and Saint Lucia, have offered to welcome evacuees.

In addition to mandating coronavirus vaccinations for cruise ship evacuees, Gonsalves was also “strongly recommending” that anyone entering emergency facilities on St. Vincent be immunized.

Roughly 11 percent of the nation’s 110,000 residents had been vaccinated. In February, St. Vincent and the Grenadines received 40,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from Indian officials. And earlier this week, the country received an additional shipment of vaccine through Covax, an initiative backed by the World Health Organization to distribute doses equitably across the globe.

The active volcano has loomed over the former British colony as a constant threat. An eruption on May 6, 1902, devastated the island and killed nearly 1,600 people. Advance warning aided the St. Vincent population during the most recent major eruption in April 1979, when no casualties were reported.

Friday’s eruption came on the heels of a recession due to a pandemic-related plunge in tourism.

Rebuilding, Gonsalves said, would be “an awesome challenge.”

“But you know, we are sturdy people and we are going to bounce back,” he said. “I am not a lamentations man.”

55,The war on ‘wokeness’ is ramping up in the United States and Britain,"In the United States and Britain, the right-wing establishments are embracing a doctrine of anti-anti-racism. Grievance over “wokeness” and “cancel culture” — two amorphous terms, with the former now often invoked as a pejorative for overzealous left-wing dogmatism, usually around issues of identity, and the latter as a condemnation of liberal censoriousness and intolerance — is now the coin of the realm on right-wing U.S. media. It’s also driving a slate of Republican legislative initiatives, including bills to ban the teaching of critical race theory in certain public institutions and control the way schools instruct American history.

All of this, at best, is tangential to the real domestic issues shaping the country’s politics, whether that’s President Biden’s statistically popular effort to inject massive stimulus into the economy or his Republican opponents in state legislatures moving to tighten voting laws. But the potency of the culture war is undeniable — and Republicans are directing their outrage toward companies that spoke out or withheld their business from Georgia after the state’s Republican legislature passed a controversial election law.

“Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declared earlier this week, no matter that the bulk of his political career, like so many in Washington, has been spent furthering the interests of a clutch of oligarchic billionaires and numerous corporate lobbyists.

“Woke is a nebulous term stolen from Black American English, repurposed by conservatives as an epithet to express opposition to forms of egalitarianism they find ridiculous or distasteful—in this case, the idea that constituents of the rival party should have an unfettered right to vote,” wrote the Atlantic’s Adam Serwer. “Wedded to the term capital, it functions as an expression of the hollowness of conservative populism, which is opposed not to the concentration of corporate power so much as to the use of that power for purposes of which conservatives disapprove.”

In Britain, a similar game is afoot. The country’s right-wing tabloids, which routinely rage about the supposed leftist disposition of public institutions, are up in arms over “woke” activists questioning the legacy of figures like Winston Churchill or staining the story of the British Empire with inconvenient — and curiously little-discussed — facts about the depravity of colonial rule.

After losing his job at one of Britain’s most popular morning shows over his incessant attacks on the erstwhile Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, broadcaster Piers Morgan gave his first major interview to Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, a leading right-wing proponent of the U.S. culture war.

“So if most people in Britain — and I think you speak for America, too — see what’s going on here, they see that it’s a scam, they see that wokeness is really an effort by the people who are already in charge to gain more power and wealth for themselves — it so clearly is that — why is everyone putting up with it?” Carlson asked.

Morgan responded that it was “terrifying” that “people feel so cowed by the fear of the woke mob that they can’t express an honestly held opinion without being immediately branded a racist.”

But in Britain, it’s the Tories who are in power and, in some instances, weaponizing “anti-woke” sentiment. A cabinet minister in January proposed legislation to protect historic statues from the “baying mob.” In February, it emerged that Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was planning legislation that would condition public funding to universities on “free speech” — a reflection of long-standing conservative grievance that also exists in the United States over left-wing orthodoxy on campuses, but an effort, in its own right, to police thought and expression.

Then, last week, a government-commissioned report concluded that there was “no institutional racism” in Britain, buttressing a long-standing talking point of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The study triggered a widespread backlash, with even some experts whose work it cited questioning the commission’s conclusions.

What’s driving this war on “wokeness”? Politics, obviously. “Republicans are trying to recast the removal of [former president Donald] Trump’s accounts from Facebook and Twitter as a narrative of liberal tech companies silencing a prominent conservative, instead of those platforms punishing Trump for using them to incite violence and encourage overturning the election results,” wrote Perry Bacon Jr. for Five Thirty Eight. “If Republicans suppress Democratic votes or try to overturn election results in future elections, as seems entirely possible, the party is likely to justify that behavior in part by suggesting the Democrats are just too extreme and woke to be allowed to control the government.”

“These attempts to breathe new life into suspiciously old fights aren’t merely about telling the Tory base what it wants to hear, or distracting Tory backbenchers restless about the lifting of lockdown, although they usefully serve both purposes,” wrote Guardian columnist Gaby Hinsliff. “They’re also about trying to dictate the terms on which normal domestic politics might resume, as the pandemic begins to recede.”

That means making life harder for the opposition Labour Party, which is desperately trying to cobble together its ungainly coalition of cosmopolitan, urbane voters in places like London with members of the more traditional working class in other parts of the country, who defected in droves to the Tories in the last election and would be potentially more animated about the “woke” agenda.

During a Thursday webinar, Labour member of Parliament David Lammy said his party can’t shirk calls for racial justice even as it seeks to appeal to the White working class. “We have to act together,” Lammy told Today’s WorldView. “It would be a huge travesty if we vacated the stage and were not making these arguments. It’s not pinning one against the other, but standing together and facing modernity.”",0

By March 25, I had a ­single-entry business visa, and would become one of four Western journalists to participate in the junta’s first attempt at international outreach since the coup.

The week-long trip, which I made alongside a crew from CNN, became a clumsy attempt by the regime to remake its global image. As in its effort to whitewash a scorched-earth campaign against Rohingya Muslims, the Myanmar military is turning to propaganda, as the world condemns it for a crackdown on ­protesters in which more than 600 people have been killed.

Closely watched

I landed in Yangon on March 30 on a relief flight from South Korea. I had been expecting a handful of aid workers on the plane. Instead it was nearly full, occupied by people from Myanmar — some repatriating

to reunite with family, others to stand in solidarity with the ­protest movement.

Even before I entered ­Myanmar, it was clear that this wasn’t a normal assignment. Ben-Menashe, or his assistant, would call me regularly in the lead-up to the trip to reprimand me for asking questions about the itinerary or safety protocols.

“Why don’t you listen when I speak?” Ben-Menashe growled at me during one particularly ­angry call. “Are you a child? Do you need permission from your parents?”

Then, from the moment we landed in Yangon, we were barred from moving around freely. I corresponded digitally with high caution, using only a burner phone connected to a VPN, concerned that all communications were closely monitored. It didn’t matter in the end: After our first day in Yangon, WiFi across the city was turned off, probably to limit what we could share ­online.

Story continues below advertisement

We were escorted around ­Yangon by soldiers — first in ­uniform, then later in civilian clothing. For the duration of our trip, these escorts monitored our every move, with cameras and phones raised to record us. They even tried following us into ­bathrooms at times. Our military liaison told me this was for “our own safety,” to protect us against the “violators,” the term used by the military to refer to the protesters.

It was also clear that the military wanted to claim transparency by showcasing the presence of international media. When we tried to photograph our military handlers, however, they would turn their heads. Attachment to this trip was not something that Defense Ministry staffers seemed to want recorded. After a photo of one of our minders was posted on Facebook, he was pulled from our convoy.

Rehearsed tales

The caravan of soldiers immediately aroused suspicion among those we drove past. I managed to remain anonymous, but news of CNN’s presence quickly made international headlines.

On our first two days, we were taken to locations carefully selected to showcase instances of violence on the part of protesters. Myanmar’s demonstrators have been overwhelmingly peaceful, but some have turned to more-radical action they ­believe is necessary to counter bloodshed by the military. We visited three township administration offices in northern Yangon, as well as several of the factories that had been reportedly burned down by protesters. This included the Gadamar Superstore in Mayangone township in Yangon, still smoking when we arrived.

At each stop, we were met by individuals with seemingly rehearsed tales of being attacked or defamed by protesters. The stories were often hard to believe, with changing timelines and little evidence. In several instances, the language employed, especially the use of the phrase “human rights violations,” seemed crafted to appeal to our sensibilities as foreign reporters.

On our last day in Yangon, we were taken to 10-Mile Market in Insein township and were finally exposed to a scene that more closely resembled the truth.

Shortly after we arrived, a rumble of noise began. Within seconds, the previously quiet street was filled with the sound of people banging on pots and pans, an act of anti-military disobedience that had become common across Myanmar since the coup. I looked around as the noise grew and saw that nearly everyone in sight was holding up the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of the protest movement.

A man stopped in front of me and explained what they were doing.

“We beat the drums against the military coup — this is our symbol. All Myanmar people don’t like the military coup; they want an elected government — the government of Aung San Suu Kyi,” said the 60-year-old retired seaman, referring to the ousted civilian leader.

A young woman approached as we were leaving and began to cry as she told me about what was unfolding in her country. She knew the risk in speaking with me, but said it was more ­important for her to share her truth. Both she and the man spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns.

“Please help us, we really need it,” the young woman said. “They are covering up the truth. The military wants to show fake news to the world.”

Soon after we left the market, we learned that two people who had spoken to the CNN crew had been arrested. This number would increase to 11 as the trip went on; most were eventually released.

According to Ben-Menashe, even the military was upset by the arrests, because they overshadowed the rest of the tour.

“They shouldn’t have been ­arrested in the first place,” Ben-Menashe said. “It was a local ­idiot cop that did it, and when the higher-ups learned about it, they were immediately released.”

'Necessary action'

After Yangon, we drove to Naypyidaw, Myanmar’s ghost-town capital that, even pre-coup, had a dystopian air. Fog rolled in as we drove down a 12-lane highway. It was still the dry season in Myanmar, yet a storm had descended on the capital and it was raining heavily.

Our time in Naypyidaw had been planned around an interview with the military’s spokesman, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, who maintained the false justification for deadly violence against protesters that had been repeated to us throughout the tour. We repeatedly asked our ­liaison and Ben-Menashe to speak with other members of the military, especially those at the highest levels; each request was denied or went unanswered.

“The protesters, in violent manners, have blocked the streets and thrown stones at the police,” said Zaw Min Tun. “At this time, we had to take necessary action against these violent protesters.”

By the end of the trip, the news of those detained for speaking to CNN dominated the narrative, rather than the military’s version of events. For me, what remains most poignant is the voices of people who spoke out against the regime — in person, from balconies, in cars and online.

57,Greta Thunberg to boycott U.N. climate conference over vaccine inequality,"She continued: “Inequality and climate injustice is already the heart of the climate crisis. If people can’t be vaccinated and travel to be represented equally that’s undemocratic and would worsen the problem.”

Thunberg’s comments are a blow for U.K. organizers, who due to the pandemic have already postponed the conference once from last November. Amid new surges in cases driven by variants, there has been speculation that it could be delayed again this year.

COP26 was slated to be the world’s most consequential climate conference since the 2015 Paris accord. On the agenda for discussion were country-level plans for cutting carbon emissions, as well as progress on the Paris agreement and the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.

Some 20,000 people attended the last two conferences, and British organizers had initially hoped to bring 30,000 people to Glasgow, according to the BBC.

Thunberg, who has attended every other major climate conference in recent years, addressed the possibility of another postponement, writing on Twitter that global action should happen either way.

“If current trends continue and the #cop26 has to be delayed that doesn’t mean we have to delay the urgent action required,” she said. “We don’t have to wait for conferences nor anyone or anything else to dramatically start reducing our emissions.”

Thunberg first burst onto the global stage with a protest outside Sweden’s parliament 2 ½ years ago. She has since sparred with global leaders, notably President Donald Trump, and inspired a global, youth-led movement pushing for climate change solutions.

Story continues below advertisement

Along the way, she has continually kept the question of climate justice at the forefront of policy discussions.

“A digital solution is of course far from optimal,” Thunberg tweeted Friday, regarding the possibility that the conference could be partially or fully moved online. “High speed Internet connection and access to computers is extremely unequal in the world. In that case we would lack representation from those whose voices need to be heard the most when it comes to the climate crisis.”

While nearly 20 percent of people in the United States are now vaccinated, many other countries are unlikely to hit that target by the end of the year, even with international assistance through the Covax program. Based on current projections, it could be years before low-income countries distribute enough vaccines to come close to herd immunity, which scientists say requires inoculating some 70 to 80 percent of a population.

Since rollouts began late last year, enough vaccine doses have been distributed to fully vaccine about 5 percent of the world’s population, but the vast majority have been administered in wealthy and Western countries. Some 40 percent of vaccines have been given in 27 wealthy nations that include only 11 percent of the world’s population, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.

While wealthy countries were able to pre-purchase vaccines, the unequal distribution means that many vulnerable populations in much of the world, such as health-care workers and the elderly, remain at high risk.

But scientists also warn that the longer the virus continues to circulate widely, the more chances it will have to change — and potentially develop vaccine resistance. Already, several highly contagious and dangerous variants are in circulation, driving new waves of infections and global disruption.

“Vaccine nationalism won’t solve the pandemic,” Thunberg wrote Friday on Twitter “Global problems need global solutions.”",0
58,"Damaging windstorm, ‘derecho’ possible in Deep South on Friday","The National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center hoisted a Level 4 out of 5 risk for severe storms, the bull's eye encapsulating parts of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi where a damaging squall line will likely later rage.

About 80 million people from Texas to Virginia face an elevated threat of severe storms on Friday. Cities facing at least a Level 3 threat include Birmingham and Mobile, Ala.; Shreveport, La.; Little Rock; and Jackson, Miss.

Story continues below advertisement

Memphis, Dallas, Atlanta and Tulsa fall in the Level 2 out of 5 threat zone for severe weather.

The squall line predicted to develop could even qualify as a derecho, or long-lived squall line that brings damaging winds over a swath at least 400 miles long, but that’s a matter of semantics that won’t change ground impacts for those affected.

At least some risk of severe weather will be present in the South and Southeast through Sunday as the disturbance shifts east before a marked decline in storminess resulting from a pattern change next week. There are signs that point to an extended quiet period before an uptick in severe weather chances much later in the month.

Story continues below advertisement

On Thursday, a surprise rotating supercell thunderstorm pelted Bryan and College Station, Tex., with destructive baseball-sized hail, smashing vehicles and shattering windows. Satellite imagery showed the storm erupting suddenly, penetrating tens of thousands of feet high. The National Weather Service hadn’t predicted any strong or severe thunderstorms in the Lone Star State in its Thursday morning forecast, the storm quickly materializing in the heat of the day just west of Waco, Tex. Additional hail-producing thunderstorms were pelting southern Alabama around daybreak Friday.

How storms may evolve Friday

Central Texas could be an initiation zone for thunderstorms Friday ahead of an upper-level disturbance diving east out of New Mexico. While an isolated rotating supercell thunderstorm with large hail, wind and a low-end tornado threat is possible somewhere along the Interstate 45 corridor between Dallas and Houston, the main threat for severe weather will brew farther east and north. Multiple clusters of storms could fire in northern Louisiana, Arkansas or eastern Oklahoma by mid- to late afternoon.

Story continues below advertisement

With strong mid-level winds feeding into storms from the west-northwest, the clusters will probably be molded into lines that may merge during the evening. Damaging winds will accompany the squall line, which should sag south and east with time. An embedded quick-hitting tornado risk will materialize and grow during the overnight as the low level jet stream strengthens.

“Multiple rounds of severe storms are possible, and extreme instability will support widespread damaging winds up to 80 mph,” wrote the Weather Service office in Jackson, Miss. “Given the expectation for multiple storms in some locations, there could be a threat for heavy rainfall producing localized flash flooding, especially tonight when storms will be more widespread.”

A few storms ahead of the main line, if they fire, could be more discrete and isolated; that would pose the risk for large to very large hail in addition to winds and a tornado or two.

Most of Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana will be affected, the storms crossing into Alabama by daybreak Saturday before losing some of their punch. The Interstate 20 corridor from east of Shreveport, La., into western Alabama is included in the greatest risk, as are cities like Jackson and Hattiesburg, Miss. and Pine Bluff, Ark.

Only about 9 percent of derechos occur in April; the vast majority, roughly two-thirds, form during May, June and July, when an uptick in temperature and humidity provide the adequate fuel to brew significant storms that can be supercharged by a proximate jet stream.

Storm potential for Saturday and beyond

Storms should ultimately push offshore into the Gulf of Mexico early Saturday, leaving behind a few remnant showers but generally more tranquil weather. A few additional strong to severe storms are possible with the decaying front from the Florida Panhandle through the Outer Banks of the Carolinas on Sunday, but overall risk will be low.

Thereafter, the Lower 48 will become enveloped in a pattern not conducive for widespread severe weather during much of next week and potentially deeper into April. A trough of low pressure, or a dip in the jet stream, will spill cool and dry air over the eastern United States and perhaps as far south as the Gulf Coast. That will squash any attempts for milder, more moisture-rich air to overspread the Deep South and Plains, cutting back on thunderstorm potential.

It comes to the chagrin of storm chasers, but much to the relief of residents in the Deep South, particularly Alabama, who already dealt with the busiest March on record for tornadoes.",0
59,Two arrested after return of stolen Confederate monument – unharmed – by White Lies Matter,"New Orleans police received a tip about the chair’s whereabouts the same night and recovered it in the city near the corner of Feliciana and North Galvez Streets.

Stanley Warnick, 32, and Kathryn Diionno, 24, face possession of stolen property charges, police said in a statement. The police are also seeking Stanley Pate, 34, in connection with the case.

The chair is valued at $500,000 by the United Daughters of the Confederacy chapter that owns it. Linda Edwards, president general of the UDC, confirmed it had the chair in a phone call with The Washington Post.

“We have possession of the chair. It’s unharmed, and we would like to thank the New Orleans Police Department for its excellent work in resolving the matter,” she said, adding that she had seen recent photos of the chair to confirm it was in good condition.

White Lies Matter, the anonymous anti-racist group that took it, admitted that photos they had previously released showing the chair with a hole broken through the seat and “turned into a toilet” were faked.

Rather, they built a replica chair “in Hollywood” out of wood and foam and used it for the commodious photos.

“Obviously, we had always intended to return the chair. We had started on fabricating the replica long before we acquired the original,” the group said in a lengthy media statement.

Story continues below advertisement

The stone chair dedicated to the memory of the president of the Confederacy disappeared from the Live Oak Cemetery, where it has stood for more than 120 years, on March 19. Weeks later, the group sent a stylized ransom note to the UDC and the media, claiming it would return the chair if the UDC flew a banner quoting Black radical Assata Shakur outside its Richmond headquarters.

They originally gave the UDC a deadline of Friday — the date Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in 1865 — but when it was clear the UDC wasn’t going to wave the banner, a spokesman for the group told The Post it decided to move up its threat to turn the chair into “a toilet.”

The UDC turned over to authorities a suspicious package it had received at its headquarters, Edward said. They did not open the package.

Story continues below advertisement

Despite revealing it had faked the damage, the group claimed the whole affair proved its point: that UDC and organizations like it are more concerned with objects than people, and specifically connecting slavery to the current criminal justice system.

“We did our part — and do not mistake it, it was not the part for heroes, but the part for idiots,” the statement read. “The real heroes are in jail cells, in graves, in history books where they continue to fight for how honest we are willing to be about the narrative behind the flag.”

“I would say they need to study our history and our mission, because that’s not what we’re about,” Edwards said.

White Lies Matter also called into question UDC’s claim that the monument was worth $500,000, writing “that’s like your uncle telling you that his old art school paintings should be valuated as if they were lost Cézannes. How valuable did the UDC think the chair was, well, they didn’t even think to bolt it down. Bet they do now though.”

Story continues below advertisement

The chair is now at an undisclosed location, Edwards said, but she’s “sure it will go back to its rightful place” in the cemetery’s Confederate Circle. A bust of Confederate general and Ku Klux Klan leader Nathan Bedford Forrest was stolen from the same area in 2012. It was never recovered but was eventually replaced.

Dallas County District Attorney Michael Jackson previously told The Post that if the thieves were caught they would be prosecuted for felonies.",0
60,"When mass shootings target a marginalized group, trauma ripples through those communities","“There is this automatic melancholy,” Risher said. “Because now you know there is another group of people out there that’s getting ready to go through hell.”

March 16 marked a turning point for many Asian Americans: It was the day their community was stricken by a mass shooting, becoming the latest minority group to suffer an attack that killed several of its own.

Story continues below advertisement

There’s a specific kind of grief that arises from being targeted, one that more and more marginalized people in the United States know too well. The shooting survivors and victims’ family members span geographies, races and religions, but they are bonded by the shared trauma they have experienced.

These tragedies often leave many in those communities who weren’t directly affected feeling unsafe and traumatized. After a shooting, many members of these communities say they felt hyper-aware of their race and an escalated sense of fear that the same could happen to them or those they love. A mass shooting seems less senseless or inexplicable when it’s directed at one of your own.

“It’s not a situation anymore where you can just wake up and go out,” said Arah Kang, 25, a Korean American in Atlanta who didn’t know those killed at the spas but now keeps a stun gun in her car and carries pepper spray on her key chain. “You become hyper aware of your racial identity, because the way [you] look is what’s putting a target on your back.”

More than 700 miles away in Chicago, Mindy Hong has been gripping a can of pepper spray as she walks her dog.

“The shooting made me realize that it could be worse than being verbally harassed or physically attacked,” said Hong, 29, a second-generation Chinese American. “You could be murdered.”

Monnica Williams, a psychology professor and mental health disparities scholar at the University of Ottawa, said mass shootings that target marginalized communities can cause a collective racial trauma among members, sometimes manifesting in depression, anxiety and other mental and physical illnesses.

“Part of the grief around it is knowing that you’re in a country where the society does not have your back,” Williams said. “That’s what’s hard to wrap your head around — it’s a sense of betrayal.”

Story continues below advertisement

That betrayal was felt in 2012 when a gunman killed seven worshipers at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin, and then again in 2015 when another gunman killed nine at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. It was felt a year after that, when a gunman opened fire at the Pulse night club in Orlando, killing 49 clubgoers, many of them LGBTQ-identifying and Latino. And in 2018, when a gunman killed 11 Jewish worshipers at the Tree of Life building — and a year later, when another gunman fired shots in a Poway, Calif., synagogue. And that betrayal was felt in 2019 when a gunman opened fire in an El Paso Walmart and killed 23 people, most of them Mexican Americans and Mexican nationals.

And then last month, a man with a self-described sex addiction allegedly opened fire at three Atlanta-area spas known for employing Asian American women, leaving eight people dead. Although authorities have yet to label it a hate crime or say that race was a motivating factor, many Asian Americans see the shootings as an attack on their entire race.

Bonds have formed between these grieving communities: An El Paso survivor has checked in on a victim’s daughter in Charleston for every tragic anniversary, trial update or subsequent mass shooting — including this one. The Tree of Life synagogue has dedicated itself to supporting other survivors, its rabbi saying in a statement that “we know the pain and stinging loss” Asian Americans are experiencing. Black and Asian American artists came together to paint a mural in Atlanta reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Stop Asian Hate,” a picture of clasped multicolored hands between them.

In the wake of the Atlanta shootings, Risher’s phone and social media lit up with messages.

“That’s how survivors, all of us, are able to get through. You check in on each other,” Risher said. “You know the person who reached out to you knows exactly the feeling of trauma and grief and heartache you’ve been going through.”

Charleston

The 2015 shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church wasn’t just an attack on the victims and their families, said Malcolm Graham, whose sister, Cynthia Graham Hurd, was one of nine victims.

“It was an attack on a race of people,” said Graham, a Charlotte City Council member. “And that attack has been going on in this country well over 200 years. That’s something that you just don’t get over, that you can say ‘I forgive you’ or sweep under the rug. . . . You never get over it.”

Black Americans have long been the frequent target of hate crimes, and they are more than three times as likely to be killed by police than their White counterparts, according to a 2020 study by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health researchers. In a country where the legacy of slavery lingers in less tangible but equally pervasive ways, many Black Americans say they don’t feel safe walking alone at night.

When another mass shooting targets another set of people based on race or religion, Graham said the trauma resurfaces.

“When these events happen, it brings back so much memories of what happened in Charleston because it’s basically the same pattern of things,” he said, describing the United States as if it were a stuck record, constantly repeating the same verse — the same kinds of attacks, the same groups of people getting hurt.

Risher, the minister who lost her mother in the church shooting, said the Atlanta attack reminded her again of the obstacles she’s faced as a Black woman, and the ones Asian American women face, too.

“Every which way you turn around, America has done something to marginalize a group of people. And they are not wanting to let that power go,” she said. “People will die before they let that power go.”

Pittsburgh

Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers said his synagogue practices the “ministry of presence” — a phrase he learned from the Rev. Eric Manning of Emanuel AME Church in Charleston. After mass shootings, synagogue members reach out to the affected communities and let them know that they’re present, they’re listening.

Story continues below advertisement

The Georgia massacre “increases the fear level now of all Asian Americans who prayed, ‘Am I next?’ And I know how that feels, to have your community wonder, ‘Am I next?’ ” said Myers, a survivor of the deadliest attack against Jews on American soil.

Fliers that Asian American restaurants posted in the synagogue’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood after the 2018 Pittsburgh shooting to show their support for the Jewish community have been recirculating in recent weeks. One read: “Many of our business members have thrived in this city particularly in Squirrel Hill, and if we shared in this good fortune, then we bear the burdens.”

It was a reminder that Asian Americans and Jews shared similar status as minority communities in the United States — and now, communities affected by mass shootings.

Story continues below advertisement

The suspected Tree of Life gunman’s animus toward the Jewish community appeared to arise not solely out of traditional antisemitism but also out of anger that many Jewish people are allies and advocates for immigrants and refugees, according to social media posts identified by authorities. Their intercultural spirit was part of why they were targeted, and in the wake of the attacks, it is how they began to heal, Jewish faith leaders said.

“We will never be totally healed — we’ll always be healing. Because when these mass shootings occur it rips the scab right back off,” the rabbi said. “We hope what we’ve learned can be of value to other communities. I wish we never had to post anything or call anybody or say anything. But we are here, and that’s part of who we are now.”

Unlike Black, Brown and Asian mass-shooting victims, many of those affected by the synagogue shooting can choose whether they want to show their identity in public, and how. And after the tragedy — despite the fear it inspired — many Jews felt their faith and pride grow.

Jeff Finkelstein, CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said he arrived at the Tree of Life building while the shooter was still inside. Just one week after the tragedy, as he headed to synagogue, he deliberately put on his kippa, a traditional cap, before he reached the building.

“I wanted to show that I’m not scared to be Jewish, because I wasn’t,” Finkelstein said. “This was an incident, it was horrible, but it was one incident and I wasn’t going to let it keep me from living my life as an American and as a Jew.”

El Paso

Luis Calvillo, 34, was recovering from post-traumatic stress disorder from his time deployed with the Army in Iraq when he was shot five times at Walmart on Aug. 3, 2019. He dove under the bake sale table of the soccer team he coaches to save himself.

That feeling of adrenaline and fear came rushing back to him when he saw the news out of Atlanta.

“I just put myself in their shoes and I prayed they will come out all right,” said Calvillo, whose 61-year-old father, Jorge Calvillo Garcia, was one of 23 people killed in the shooting.

The shootings in El Paso, Atlanta and elsewhere left many pondering what pushed the gunmen to such acts of hatred.

“I keep on wondering, ‘What goes through the head of those people? To start to go and shoot so many people, as many as they can?’ ” said Francoise Feliberti, a volunteer for the El Paso soccer league Paso Del Norte Soccer Association, which includes the team Calvillo coaches.

The suspected Texas gunman, who faces 90 counts of federal hate-crime and firearms charges, had set out to kill Mexicans and Mexican Americans to prevent the “the Hispanic invasion of Texas,” according to a manifesto he allegedly posted online.

He did what many mass shooters have done before him — he cited a previous shooting, in this case the New Zealand mosque tragedy, where 51 Muslims were killed. The result was the deadliest hate-driven homicide event since FBI hate-crime reporting began three decades ago, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism.

The shooters “still believe on the White empowerment that was given years back and they want to continue with their empowerment,” Calvillo said.

“That’s why we get targeted,” he said, and that’s why they’re not the only ones.

Since surviving the shooting, Calvillo has opted to open-carry a gun to protect himself.

“That’s what we have come to. It’s sad that we have to go to violence instead of just civil matters, but it is what it is,” he said, adding: “It’s very sad who we’ve become.”

Atlanta

These mass shootings follow a similar pattern: A gunman shows up, and then the police. The news cameras arrive, and soon after, the public outrage. The calls for action rise as the makeshift memorials grow. Donations to families and causes flow from across the country.

And then there are the funerals. And the slow disappearance from the public eye.

The mass shootings follow similar patterns, and Atlanta was no different.

Alexis Suh, 28, recently attended a victim’s funeral in Atlanta. An old Korean ballad played during the service, and the victim’s family members spoke about the woman they’d lost: a typical Korean grandmother who loved her children and especially doted on her grandchildren.

“That shook me,” said Suh, who didn’t know the victim or her family, but in many ways felt as though she did.

Since the shooting, Suh, a real estate finance attorney in Atlanta, installed a security system for her home. She has found herself repeating a new refrain to her friends and family: “Be safe.”

Along with recalculating risk, the attack caused many to reexamine cultural norms.

“There is a very big sense of betrayal. Confusion and betrayal. Because we’ve been fed that if we just do the right things, put our head down, work hard, harm wouldn’t be done to us. That we would be protected by America,” Suh said.

That was a lie, she said, and March 16 proved it.

But amid the grief, she is reminded of the Korean word “jung.”

It has no English translation, and it’s difficult to define. It describes a sense of solidarity, connection and understanding even among strangers; an intangible, collective bond between people; an inexplicable desire to care for one another.",0
61,Biden acts on gun control after pressure from impatient activists,"The president unveiled new rules on “ghost guns” — firearms that are assembled at home, which lack serial numbers and are harder to track — among other moves designed to make it harder for unqualified people to obtain dangerous weapons.

Story continues below advertisement

Biden also announced David Chipman as his pick to run the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, although it is unclear how the nominee will fare in an evenly divided Senate. Chipman is a former ATF agent and now a senior adviser to a gun-control group founded by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was severely injured in a mass shooting in 2011.

Biden said his moves Thursday do not relieve Congress of the responsibility to act. He urged lawmakers to take up gun-control legislation, including measures already passed by the House that would require more gun buyers to undergo background checks.

“They’ve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers, members of Congress, but they’ve passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence,” Biden said. “Enough prayers. Time for some action.”

Story continues below advertisement

Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, also urged Congress to pass long-stalled gun measures. “What are we waiting for?” Harris said. “Because we aren’t waiting for a tragedy. I know that we’ve had more tragedy than we can bear.”

President Biden on April 8 outlined his administration’s plan to curb gun violence after two recent mass shootings. (The Washington Post)

Biden’s moves came amid a growing impatience from gun-control activists that the administration has not acted more quickly. Biden promised during his campaign that he would take action to limit gun violence on the first day of his administration, but that fell by the wayside.

Biden has prioritized other issues in the early going, including coronavirus response and economic aid. He suggested recently that he considers gun control less urgent than those immediate crises, one that can be tackled over the long term.

Story continues below advertisement

But the issue of gun violence moved vividly the forefront after the two mass shootings, one in Georgia in which eight people died, and another in Colorado, where 10 were killed.

Biden was joined in the Rose Garden by first lady Jill Biden and a number of longtime gun-control advocates, including Giffords, who became a leading anti-gun activist after she survived a mass shooting outside a supermarket. Her husband, Mark Kelly, is now a senator from Arizona.

After giving his remarks, Biden bounded offstage and offered Giffords an elbow bump. “I wasn’t supposed to do that,” the president said.

Biden laid out several ways his administration will tackle gun violence. He ordered action on ghost guns, firearms without serial numbers that are sold in kits. He directed the Justice Department to draft a new rule regulating a device that can be placed on a pistol to turn it into a short-barreled rifle.

Story continues below advertisement

He also instructed the Justice Department to create a template that states can use to enact “red flag” laws, which allow judges to seize firearms from people who are deemed a threat to themselves or others. And he ordered a repeat of a landmark 2000 gun-trafficking study that was instrumental in helping police determine the source of guns used in crimes.

Gun activists said they were pleased. “The president did a really great job here looking at the many, many forms of gun violence and addressing those,” said Brian Lemek, executive director of Brady PAC, a gun-control group. “We knew he would come through.”

Some said Biden’s willingness to use the bully pulpit to focus on gun control was perhaps the most meaningful aspect of Thursday’s event.

Story continues below advertisement

“You need the president pushing,” said Paul Helmke, former president of the Brady Campaign, adding that Biden’s rhetoric on gun control is far stronger than President Barack Obama’s initial approach to the issue.

Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has a record of supporting gun-control initiatives, including the 10-year assault weapons ban that was part of a 1994 crime bill he sponsored.

But the politics of gun control have always been turbulent. Rural voters, who skew sharply Republican, strongly support gun rights, while Democratic-leaning city dwellers often oppose them. The suburbanites coveted by both parties have tended to be more open to gun control recently.

Democrats used to shy away from talking about the subject, but a spate of mass shootings in recent years created a new set of young activists, making gun violence a bigger subject on the campaign trail. Both parties are using the issue to motivate their base to vote, a big shift from a decade ago, when Democrats were wary of the issue and believed it had contributed to some of their election losses.

Even now, Biden faces an uphill struggle to pass any new gun laws. The 50-50 Senate means that 10 Republicans would need to join all Democrats to pass gun restrictions, since 60 votes are needed to pass most bills in the Senate.

The country’s largest pro-gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, is mired in multiple legal battles, but it remains influential among Republicans. On Thursday, NRA officials referred to Biden’s Rose Garden event as a “circus” on their official Twitter account and outlined their opposition to his moves.

“These actions could require Americans to surrender lawful property, push states to expand confiscation orders, and put a gun control lobbyist to head ATF,” the officials said. “Biden is dismantling the 2nd Amendment.”

Anticipating this argument, Biden insisted that his moves are constitutional. “The idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we’re recommending are contrary to the Constitution,” Biden said.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who attended Thursday’s event, noted that Attorney General Merrick Garland recently served as chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which hears legal challenges to federal regulations.

Story continues below advertisement

That leaves Garland well equipped to draft the new Justice Department regulations in a way that would allow them to survive court challenges, Blumenthal said. “If you had to pick someone who knows about the importance of dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s when it comes to rulemaking, Merrick Garland would be your first choice,” he added.

Garland himself signaled Thursday he takes the issue seriously.

“We stand here today, not at a moment of tragedy, but in the midst of enduring tragedy,” the attorney general said. “I know that the Department of Justice alone cannot solve the problem. . . . But there is work for the department to do, and we intend to do it.”

Activists applauded the nomination of Chipman, especially since Biden has generally avoided tapping activists to fill key roles.

“He knows and understands guns and the gun violence prevention movement and the many avenues for individuals who are prohibited from having guns to get them,” Lemek said.

One surprise was that Biden opted not to use his executive authority to erode the liability shield enjoyed by gun manufacturers, a step he had pledged to take as a candidate. Instead he urged Congress to remove the shield.

“Imagine how different it would be had that same exemption been available to tobacco companies, who knew and lied about the danger they were causing, the cancer caused and the like,” Biden said.

He added: “If I get one thing on my list — the Lord came down and said, ‘Joe, you get one of these’ — give me that one.”

White House press secretary Jen Psaki, asked why it had taken more than 70 days for the president to address the liability issue, replied, “There’s no holdup. It’s just, legislation needs to be reintroduced.”

62,"Kansas Senate majority leader was drunk in police chase, called an officer ‘Donut boy,’ authorities say","“All for going the wrong way,” Suellentrop said to the state highway patrol officer who had arrested him, according to an affidavit. “Donut boy.”

As a phlebotomist took a blood sample, 69-year-old Suellentrop also allegedly told Kansas Highway Patrol Officer Austin Shepley that he would beat him in a fight.

“He looked me up and down stating he played state sports competitively"" in high school, Shepley wrote in the affidavit, which was reported by the Topeka Capital-Journal and other local media on Thursday. “He stated he could ‘take me.’”

After being charged with a felony for eluding police, Suellentrop announced that he would pass most of his leadership duties to Assistant Majority Leader Sen. Larry Alley (R), the Kansas City Star reported. But Suellentrop has retained his title and a nearly $500 biweekly stipend that comes with the majority leader role.

The state senator’s first court date is set for June 3. If convicted of a felony, Suellentrop would be banned from holding elected office in Kansas. Suellentrop did not immediately respond to a message from The Washington Post late on Thursday.

The details in the case released on Thursday left Democrats calling for Suellentrop’s ouster and spurred Republicans to concede that severe consequences would be “unavoidable.”

“While Senator Suellentrop deserves due process and appropriate consequences for his irresponsible behavior, he also deserves to be held to the same level of accountability as the Kansans he has been elected to represent,” state Senate Minority Leader Dinah Sykes (D) said in a statement Thursday, KSNT reported. “I am disappointed that he has not come to this conclusion himself.”

The traffic incident began after midnight on March 16, when a driver phoned 911 after a near miss with a white SUV traveling the wrong way down Interstate 70.

“They about hit me, but I’m okay. I’m fine,” the caller told an emergency dispatcher, the Kansas City Star reported.

Story continues below advertisement

At least two other drivers also called 911 to report nearly being hit by the SUV. “They were in the wrong lane and they met coming up the on-ramp and scared the crap out of me,” a second caller said, the Star reported.

Following the emergency calls, Shepley drove his police cruiser west down I-70 until he spotted the SUV in the wrong lane, the affidavit said. The officer watched as two cars nearly collided with it.

Shepley turned his cruiser’s lights on and pursued the SUV, driving as fast as 90 mph in a 65 mph zone, according to the affidavit. The SUV did not stop, continuing to drive erratically and in the wrong direction.

Twice, the officer attempted to stop the SUV using a “tactical vehicle intervention.” On the second attempt, after a 10-minute pursuit, the officer succeeded and the driver finally pulled over, police said.

Shepley approached the SUV with his gun drawn and told the driver to turn the vehicle off. According to the affidavit, the driver did not immediately comply with the officer’s directions to kill the SUV’s engine.

“As I approached the driver, he had his left hand out the window and looked back at me with a confused, frightened, blank stare,” Shepley wrote. “He was not registering my commands or responding to them.”

Shepley holstered his gun and reached into the vehicle to switch the engine off. According to the affidavit, the officer could smell “the odor of an alcoholic beverage” inside the SUV. Shepley pulled Suellentrop out of the SUV and placed him in handcuffs before placing him in the police cruiser’s passenger seat.

The affidavit said Suellentrop struggled to keep his balance, his eyes were “watery, droopy, and … blood shot,” and he mumbled and slurred his speech. Suellentrop declined to speak with the arresting officer after being read his Miranda rights, the affidavit said. Shepley then escorted the lawmaker to be processed and booked into custody.

Suellentrop declined a breathing-based sobriety test. Police sought a warrant to obtain a blood sample to test for alcohol, and a phlebotomist was called to draw his blood for testing.

The tests later showed that Suellentrop’s blood alcohol concentration was 0.17, according to the affidavit, more than double the legal limit of 0.08.

As details of the incident have been revealed to the public through local media reports over the last month, elected leaders in the state have called for political consequences. Suellentrop’s fellow Republicans hinted that the party’s senate leadership might change after the current legislative session ends in May.

63,Dallas police officer was charged with plotting two murders. But a judge dropped the case after detective’s ‘error.’,"Now, police say that evidence was incorrect — an admission that came as a judge on Wednesday agreed with prosecutors to drop the charges, citing insufficient evidence.

Riser, who had been in custody since his arrest last month, walked out free later that day.

“This department that I used to love, respect, they have disrespected me, they have embarrassed my family all over a make-believe lie,” Riser, 37, told a crowd of reporters gathered outside the courthouse and the jail.

On Thursday, Dallas Police Chief Eddie García — who fired Riser last month after an internal probe — said he disagreed with the decision and vowed to continue the investigation.

“I’m disappointed in yesterday’s ruling, there’s no question in my mind about that,” García said at a news conference. “We’re going to continue to thoroughly investigate this case, support the work that our detectives did.”

Dallas County Criminal District Attorney John Creuzot told The Washington Post in an email that the judge’s decision did not mean the case was closed.

Toby Shook, an attorney representing Riser, said Wednesday’s hearing confirmed his client’s innocence.

Story continues below advertisement

“The Dallas Police Department has been investigating this case for several years,” Shook told The Post in an email. “After two hours of testimony from the lead detective it became very clear that there is no credible evidence to establish probable cause to charge Bryan Riser.”

Riser, a 13-year-veteran, was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder on March 4 for allegedly ordering the killings of Liza Saenz, 31, and Albert Douglas, 61. He was fired on March 9 after an Internal Affairs investigation.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson (D) also formed a committee to investigate why Riser was allowed to remain on the force while detectives investigated him in both killings, WFAA reported.

Story continues below advertisement

The case against Riser grew out of charges against three other men — Kevin Kidd, Emmanuel Kilpatrick and Jermon Simmons — in the killings of Saenz, whose body was found in the Trinity River in March 2017, and Douglas, whose body was never recovered.

In August 2019, one of the three men incriminated Riser, according to a police affidavit. The man, who police declined to identify to protect his identity, said Riser, whom he knew from his youth, had offered him nearly $10,000 to carry out both kidnappings and killings.

Last month, police said they had obtained Riser’s cellphone data from the FBI, which confirmed the officer was nearby both the killings. But on Tuesday, the Dallas police published an “updated” copy of the affidavit. Instead of placing him near the murders, the cellphone data only showed Riser near an area where the witness said he and Riser had “met to plan the kidnapping and murders.”

Story continues below advertisement

At a Wednesday court hearing on the case, Detective Esteban Montenegro admitted he had made a mistake when typing the first version of the document. The line claiming that cellphone data put Riser near the scene of the crimes was “an error on my part,” he said.

Despite his mistake, Montenegro argued there was still enough evidence to present the case to a grand jury. But prosecutors pushed back.

“Where we stand as a district attorney’s office right now today, we do not feel there’s sufficient probable cause for this case,” Dallas County prosecutor Jason Fine told Criminal Court Judge Audrey Moorehead.

Fine also revealed that prosecutors were first brought the case in December 2019, and said at the time there wasn’t enough evidence. Prosecutors said the same thing last month, Fine said — but police arrested Riser anyway.

Shook said that the man incriminating Riser has “all the reason in the world to lie and to try to gain advantage by trying to implicate a police officer.”

Moorehead sided with prosecutors and dropped both charges. Later that afternoon, Riser walked out of the courthouse with a plastic bag containing his personal belongings, WFAA reported.",0
64,Olympic karate star hit with anti-Asian rant in California park: ‘I didn’t think it would happen to me',"As he drove off, he yelled anti-Asian slurs, Kokumai said.

The 28-year-old, who is set to compete in the Tokyo Olympics this summer, said she was stunned to be targeted by the random abuse — and horrified that no one in the park came to her aid.

“Yes, what happened was horrible, but I don’t know which was worse, a stranger yelling and threatening to hurt me for no reason or people around me who witnessed everything and not doing a thing,” Kokumai wrote on Instagram.

Kokumai, who was born in Hawaii to Japanese parents, is one of thousands of Asian Americans who have reported being harassed or assaulted since the beginning of the pandemic. Orange County has also seen several recent cases, including a 23-year-old man arrested last month after allegedly kicking a 69-year-old Asian man and stomping on him. On Monday, local prosecutors charged a man with a hate crime for allegedly pelting rocks at an Asian women’s car in the county.

A seven-time national champion who is ranked fifth in the world, Kokumai is the only American among 40 karate athletes who qualified for the Summer Olympics — the first time the sport will be included. Kokumai competes in a discipline called kata, which focuses on specific movements that are judged on speed, strength, rhythm and technique.

Kokumai recently joined other Asian American Olympians to speak out about the rise in racist violence. During a virtual U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee media summit on Wednesday, Kokumai, gymnast Yul Moldauer and wheelchair tennis player Dana Mathewson described their experiences of hatred.

The United States is no stranger to anti-Asian racism. As early as 1882, the Chinese exclusion act banned Chinese immigration for 10 years. (Monica Rodman, Sarah Hashemi/The Washington Post)

“People are getting hit, people are getting slashed, people are getting killed,” Kokumai said. “We are, in a way, being targeted, and the violence, harassment and discrimination is real.”

Kokumai’s recent firsthand experience happened on April 2 at Grijalva Park in Orange, Calif. Kokumai said she often works out in the park and was talking to a friend on the phone when the man, who has not been identified, approached her.

Story continues below advertisement

The first video Kokumai posted to Instagram shows the man walking past her and heading toward his car. He yells at Kokumai to “get away from me” and “don’t be looking at me behind my back.”

In one video, Kokumai laughs uncomfortably, trying to brush the man off as he continues his diatribe while he stands in front of his car, which is parked behind her. It was only later that she understood how troubling the interaction was, she said.

“Obviously I was scared,” Kokumai told KTLA.

As the man drove away, Kokumai said she could hear him saying “'Chinese' and ‘sashimi,’ which have no connection at all,” she said at the media summit.

What was just as jarring, she wrote on Instagram, was that many people stood by and watched. Some smiled and some walked by and didn’t say anything, she wrote. One woman approached her toward the end of the incident and asked if she was okay.

“I didn’t know what to do,” she wrote on Instagram, adding that the harassment made her “angry, frustrated, confused, scared.” But the lack of interference by onlookers left her “heartbroken to see and experience how people could be so cold,” she wrote. “We need to take care of each other. Why is it so hard to treat people with respect[?]”

Kokumai told KTLA that despite being aware of the increasing violence against Asian people, she was taken aback when it happened to her.

“I didn’t think it would happen to me at a park I usually go to train,” she said.

Kokumai has not reported the incident to the police, according to KTLA. But she chose to publicize it on her Instagram to raise awareness of what Asian Americans are experiencing around the nation.",0
65,"Ruling challenges Va.’s tradition of judges, police officers prosecuting misdemeanor cases","But this month a Fairfax County judge dismissed one of those cases on appeal in circuit court, finding the arrangement was unconstitutional and the absence of a prosecutor deprived the defendant of fundamental safeguards for an equitable proceeding.

Story continues below advertisement

The ruling, which lawyers involved said is the first of its kind in Virginia, applies only to the case of a man accused of violating court restrictions related to a drunken driving conviction. But attorneys for the defendant hope it becomes a blueprint for challenging a statewide system they say shortchanges the accused in thousands of misdemeanor cases each year.

Advertisement

“If the commonwealth is not there, there should be no case,” said Danielle Brown, one of the defense attorneys. “There is no way to constitutionally or ethically proceed on these matters absent a commonwealth attorney.”

Her client Harwinder Sangha, who had a previous conviction for drunken driving, was charged in February 2020 with driving a car without an ignition interlock, a device with a breathalyzer that prevents intoxicated drivers from starting a vehicle; driving on a DUI-suspended license; and driving with an open container of alcohol.

Story continues below advertisement

Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Steve Descano declined to participate because the case fell into a category of misdemeanors, which includes some property crimes, nuisance issues such as trespassing and other cases that he said his office does not have the resources to give appropriate attention.

Descano says the Fairfax County prosecutor’s office is one of the most underfunded in the state and he must preserve staff for the most critical​ offenses. His office still does handle some weightier misdemeanors such as serious domestic violence, sexual battery and DUI.

Advertisement

Under Virginia law, prosecutors’ offices are required to handle all felonies and some appeals but are not obligated to prosecute misdemeanors, and many commonwealth attorneys across the state do not. Descano points out his office still handles more misdemeanors than some other prosecutors in the state.

Story continues below advertisement

Prior to Sangha’s trial in Fairfax County General District Court in August, the defense team filed a motion seeking to have the case dismissed on a range of constitutional grounds.

Brown and attorney Mark Rasch said in an interview that when judges are the ones questioning officers and witnesses — taking on a role a prosecutor would fill if they handled the case — they are abdicating their role as a neutral arbiter and the move violates the Constitution’s separation of powers between the judicial and executive branches.

Advertisement

The defense attorneys argue the absence of a prosecutor degrades a defendant’s due process and fair trial rights because the commonwealth provides a range of critical functions that aren’t replaced: evaluating whether a case is worth pursuing, examining if police legally conducted an investigation, negotiating a plea deal, and reducing or dismissing charges.

Story continues below advertisement

Most importantly, they said, no one plays the key role of finding and turning over evidence that might point toward a defendant’s innocence, something prosecutors are legally required to do.

Fairfax County General District Court Judge Susan Earman dismissed the defense team’s motion and proceeded with Sangha’s trial, questioning the police officer involved and ultimately convicting Sangha on the count of driving without an ignition interlock.

The defense team indicated in filings the trial exhibited some of the pitfalls of the system. Under questioning from defense attorneys, the police officer who cited Sangha admitted he had not looked for any exculpatory evidence that might be turned over to the defense, according to defense filings. Earman sentenced Sangha to six months in jail, a term the defense team calculated was nine times longer than any sentence for a similar offense in Fairfax County in the previous two years.

Story continues below advertisement

Sangha appealed his conviction to Fairfax County Circuit Court. When Descano’s office again refused to participate in the case, Sangha’s attorneys filed a new motion to have the case dismissed.

Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Richard Gardiner took the issue under advisement and put out a call for legal briefs from any interested party. The American Civil Liberties Union, a police association, a victims’ rights group, the public defender and others responded.

Gardiner wrote in a lengthy opinion that the charge against Sangha appeared legitimate, so he was reluctantly dismissing the case. Gardiner wrote he could not ignore the defendant’s right to exculpatory evidence, established by the Supreme Court case Brady v. Maryland.

“The court is bound by the law and cannot jump into the breach created by the absence of the Commonwealth Attorney and take on the role of the executive, even to a small degree,” Gardiner wrote. “And the court cannot allow [the] defendant to be deprived of his rights pursuant to Brady and its progeny.”

Descano, who argued in a brief it was legally permissible for the cases to go forward without a prosecutor, said in a statement he nevertheless welcomed the ruling.

“It reflects the view for which I have long advocated: that the system functions best when the Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney has the capacity to directly handle, and bring its reform-minded approach to, as many cases as possible,” Descano said.

Story continues below advertisement

In recent months, the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors has added 15 positions to the prosecutor’s office and has added funding for an additional 15 in next year’s budget, which has yet to be approved.

Descano said the increased staffing will allow his office to handle more misdemeanors.

Descano’s office was skeptical of the defense attorneys’ contention that the ruling might serve as a road map to challenge misdemeanor cases without a prosecutor in the state’s lower general district courts, where the vast majority of such cases are tried.

Descano’s move to withdraw prosecutors from misdemeanor cases has been controversial.

Mehagen D. McRae, an attorney who specializes in assisting victims of domestic violence, complained Descano’s office is not handling some domestic assaults that do not involve intimate partners, leaving victims to navigate the justice system on their own. She said some offenders are also going unpunished because such cases are more likely to collapse without a prosecutor guiding them.

Dixon is also charged with two counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony and reckless endangerment in the killings of Dominique Williams, 32, of Hyattsville, and James Lionel Johnson, 38, of District Heights, Takoma Park officials said. Dixon also has been charged with attempted second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony in the assault of Michael Thomas, 36, who was the driver of a vehicle Dixon shot into, according to police.

Dixon was taken into custody Friday morning “without incident,” police said.

The incident began shortly after 5 a.m. Wednesday when Takoma Park police officers were called to the Takoma Overlook apartments on New Hampshire Avenue for a report of multiple shots fired in the parking lot, charging documents state.

Officers found Dixon, who lives in the building, on the scene. He identified himself as a Pentagon police officer and said he was leaving for work when he noticed a Lexus without headlights driving through the complex’s parking lot, according to charging documents.

Dixon told investigators he saw one of the men associated with the vehicle attempt to break the window of another vehicle in the parking lot, officials said. Dixon reported he confronted the men in the Lexus and one of them “gassed it” nearly running him over, according to charging documents. Dixon then opened fire, hitting Johnson and Williams, police said.

The Lexus left the parking lot and Thomas drove to Prince George’s Hospital Center, where Johnson and Williams were pronounced dead, according to charging documents. Thomas was not injured and fled from the hospital, but was later interviewed.

During the investigation that followed, Takoma Park police determined a vehicle had been broken into at the apartment complex, but authorities said other elements of Dixon’s story fell apart after detectives reviewed surveillance video that captured the incident.

The footage showed Dixon confronting the men at the Lexus, but he didn’t open fire until the men were leaving the parking lot and he was standing behind the vehicle, according to charging documents. Dixon fired multiple shots, the documents said.

The charging documents said the Lexus “no longer presented an immediate danger that would have justified the use of deadly force.”

An autopsy found the men were struck in their back upper bodies by the bullets, consistent with the shots being fired from behind the vehicle, according to the charging documents.

DeVaul said at the Friday news conference that Dixon had no law enforcement powers in Maryland.

“He was a civilian who acted as a civilian, who happened to be a law enforcement officer in another jurisdiction,” DeVaul said.

He added later that citizens should report crimes in progress, but not intervene: “Call us and allow us to handle the situation.”

Takoma Park police detective Charles Earle said at the Friday news conference that the department is still investigating whether the victims had a gun in their car. Authorities have no plans to charge the surviving victim.

Efforts to reach Williams’s family members have been unsuccessful.

Dixon was being held on no bond at the county detention center Friday and he will have a bond hearing on Monday. When reached by a reporter by phone, relatives of Dixon declined to immediately comment.

The shooting marks the second time in recent weeks that an off-duty Pentagon police officer has fired their weapon.

According to D.C. police, the officer, who was not identified, told investigators that the youth pointed a gun at him. The officer tried to grab it but was unsuccessful and then pulled his own gun and fired at least one shot, according to his account.",0
67,"In reversal, Alexandria schools will adopt three feet of distance inside classrooms","“It would be unfair for me to throw out a date today,” he said. “I just want to make sure . . . we can work with everyone, so it’s not a complete turnover overnight.”

On Wednesday, the superintendent had sent a message to families announcing that his Northern Virginia school system of 16,000 would not immediately switch from six to three feet of distancing. This went against CDC advice: The federal agency announced in late March that it was shifting its recommendation for appropriate classroom distancing from six to three feet.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

It also went against a trend in Northern Virginia, where the other major school systems had said they would adopt three feet of spacing between students learning in-person.

Hutchings’s message spurred outrage from some parents, who said they could not understand why Alexandria was apparently ignoring best practices sanctioned by the government’s top scientific experts.

And on Thursday, the majority of the school board spoke up to agree with them. Member Christopher A. Suarez (District A) said he was “blindsided” by the superintendent’s decision to stick with six feet, calling it “very concerning.”

“If the CDC is saying we need to get to three feet in our classrooms,” said vice chair Veronica Nolan (District B), “then we need to get there.”

Story continues below advertisement

And member Ramee A. Gentry (District C) said that, ever since schools first shut down more than a year ago, Hutchings has promised he would be guided above all else by the CDC. She added: “In my five years on the school board, this is probably the most frustrated I have ever been.”

Advertisement

Regardless of when Alexandria accomplishes the switch to three feet, the superintendent promised that he would send roughly 3,000 children into school buildings over the next few weeks. Alexandria has to date returned approximately 5,000 children, representing about 35 percent of its student body, for two days a week of in-person learning.

In deciding which additional students to return, Hutchings and his staff said, Alexandria will prioritize children who are struggling most.

Story continues below advertisement

First on the list are students with disabilities, those who do not speak English and those experiencing homelessness. Next up are students who are suffering emotionally, mentally or socially, followed by students who have earned D’s or F’s. Then come children unable to access the necessary technology for online learning and, after them, students who are currently learning virtually but would like to switch into the in-person program. Last on the list are new students who enrolled in Alexandria schools in January of this year.

Advertisement

Using this system, Alexandria plans to send qualifying pre-kindergarteners through fifth-graders back into classrooms starting April 20. The following week, qualifying students in grades six through 12 will return.

The school system is working to make space for the newcomers in part by getting in touch with children who signed up for in-person learning, but have so far failed to show up. School staffers are calling parents to ask why their child has remained absent, and to ask whether the family still wishes to participate in face-to-face instruction.

Story continues below advertisement

Following these efforts, students who have not shown up for in-person learning by April 23 will be “converted back to virtual,” Hutchings and his staffers told the board.

“I want to make it very clear that we want our students back,” he said. “It is important for us to follow the CDC guidelines . . . what we want to be able to work through, is making sure that . . . we are doing all of the appropriate safety and health mitigations.”

Hutchings delivered this speech shortly before the board’s vote mandating that he switch to three feet of distance. It was the closest he came to publicly addressing the controversy over his decision to stick with six feet.

Story continues below advertisement

Otherwise, he said several times in the meeting — also before the vote — that he was committed to following CDC guidance, and to ensuring that Alexandria children will learn five days a week in-person this fall. He also noted it took “a lot of work” to transition the 5,000 students to face-to-face instruction over the past month or so. He said the school district had to be “very methodical and strategic with our planning.”

In justifying the original decision to stick with six feet, Alexandria officials published an online FAQ listing “operational considerations.” These included the fact that the CDC still defines a “close contact” as taking place when someone comes within six feet of a coronavirus case for more than 15 minutes. If the spacing between students shrank to three feet, the FAQ writers argued, Alexandria would see a spike in quarantining, and a disruption in learning.

And during Thursday’s meeting, ahead of the vote, staffers from the school system and the Alexandria Health Department walked the school board through every contingency and detail of the CDC’s revised three-foot guidance. Presenters noted that the CDC says middle- and high school students have to revert to six feet of distancing if community transmission of the virus is “high”; that teachers and students are still required to stay six feet apart; and that students are supposed to keep six feet away from each other when they have to remove their masks for eating, singing or exercise.

The school board was not dissuaded.

“Certainly I appreciate walking through the caveats of this new guidance,” board member Michelle Rief (District A) said. “That said, I think these are challenges we can tackle.”

And Gentry said she understands that the adoption of three feet could lead to more “quarantine situations.”",0

With Hogan term-limited, Baker will be among the Democrats — who outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 among registered voters in Maryland — lining up to try to take back the governor’s mansion. Baker’s plans were first reported by the website Maryland Matters.

Baker, 62, said in an interview that he sees himself as well-positioned to address problems that have been revealed by the coronavirus pandemic, including deep health disparities, and to help lead the state’s economic recovery.

“I believe that you can make government work for everybody — that we don’t have to accept things the way they are,” he said.

Baker said he would not run if his successor, County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks (D) launched a gubernatorial bid. Alsobrooks, 50, is considered a rising star within the party and raised the most money of potential candidates in 2020. But she has said her focus, for the moment, is on Prince George’s County.

Baker took office as county executive one month after his predecessor, Jack B. Johnson, was arrested on corruption charges.

While leading Maryland’s second-most populous jurisdiction, he helped rebuild trust in government and led an economic transformation — including the opening of MGM National Harbor and plans for a new regional hospital set to open this year.

Her remains, concealed on a highway median strip in Stafford, Va., were found in 1991 but not identified until 2018, after Rodriguez-Cruz had been charged with murder in the District.

Thursday’s sentencing followed two related investigations involving multiple police departments and a suspect described by authorities as having an explosive temper toward women who spurned him.

About a decade after Marta Rodriguez’s 1989 disappearance from Arlington County, Rodriguez-Cruz became romantically involved with a D.C. woman, Pamela Butler, a 47-year-old computer specialist for the Environmental Protection Agency. In February 2009, she also mysteriously vanished.

Although Butler’s body has not been found, Rodriguez-Cruz, a clerical worker who had been living in Northern Virginia, was arrested in 2017 by D.C. police, largely based on circumstantial evidence. He eventually admitted he had strangled her. Butler’s family said she was in the process of breaking up with him when she disappeared.

He led investigators to a spot along Interstate 95 in Stafford, but the area had since been dug up for construction, and Butler’s bones were gone.

While searching that area, police learned that different remains, which were still being held in storage, had been found there in 1991. DNA tests confirmed that the remains were those of Marta Rodriguez, and Rodriguez-Cruz was charged with killing her. An autopsy report lists the cause and manner of Marta Rodriguez’s death as undetermined.

In March 1989, two months before Marta Rodriguez vanished, Rodriguez-Cruz, a former military police officer, was charged with abducting and assaulting her. In that incident, an Arlington County police officer saw him dragging her along a street, bound and gagged, authorities said.

Carroll County, April 15 and April 7

Lawrence Nokes was admitted to Carroll Hospital Center on March 30 and intubated. After about a week in a coma, his prognosis improved, his family recalled. He started to breathe on his own. When he regained consciousness, Nokes asked for just one person: Minnette, his wife of 24 years.

Minnette Nokes had died days earlier, on April 7, a day before her 72nd birthday, of a heart attack. The medical examiner’s office said she posthumously tested positive for the coronavirus. Once Lawrence Nokes found out, his breathing grew raspy again. He died on April 15, eight days after his wife.

D.C. residents can shop in retail establishments and get haircuts and manicures as long as they wear masks when possible and the businesses follow various restrictions on crowd size and cleaning procedures. Non-essential retail businesses are limited to 25 percent capacity or 250 people, whichever is fewer. Indoor group fitness classes can operate with up to 10 people in addition to the trainer, while outdoor group fitness classes can operate up to 50 people, in addition to the trainer. Fitness centers are limited to 25 percent capacity or 250 people, whichever is fewer. Playgrounds are open. Child care centers can operate with the same child to staff ratios as before the pandemic. Museums and the National Zoo can operate with a maximum of 250 people in indoor spaces. Libraries can reopen at 25 percent capacity, with no more than 250 people inside at any time — whichever is fewer. Movie theaters can operate with up to 25 people in an auditorium and 25 percent capacity cap.

Are there enough hospital beds in the District?

Daily hospital bed statistics can be found here.

Have any variants of the virus been found in the District?

Yes. On Feb. 11, Health Director LaQuandra Nesbitt announced that the variants first discovered in the United Kingdom and in South Africa have been found in the city for the first time. Three people were confirmed to have the variant from the U.K., and one was confirmed to have the variant from South Africa.

How can I get tested for the virus?

Many of the tests conducted in the District each day happen at private doctor’s offices, so if you have a primary care provider, calling your doctor is the best first step.

If you are looking for a free public testing location, the District offers tests every weekday and some weekends at firehouses and other walk-up and drive-through sites throughout the city. Check here to find out which testing sites are open on the day you are interested in visiting.

Can I travel in and out of the city?

Yes. The District relaxed the rules for out-of-state travel. If you travel to another state, you are required to quarantine at your home upon returning until you can get a negative coronavirus test, generally three to five days after your trip. If you prefer not to get tested for the coronavirus, you should stay home for two weeks after traveling. Those who are fully vaccinated and have waited 14 days after their final dose are not required to quarantine after they travel out of the D.C. region as long as it’s been within 90 days of the last dose.

Story continues below advertisement

If you want to host visitors from outside the D.C. region, the District’s rules require that your guests get a negative coronavirus test at home before they come here, and if they are staying for longer than three days, that they again get tested while they are in the District. They can use the city’s public testing sites free.

Is it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that it’s safe to travel once you’ve been fully vaccinated against coronavirus. However, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky still says she does not recommend travel in general. “I would advocate against general travel overall,"" she said at a White House briefing April 2. ""Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel. Our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so.”

Story continues below advertisement

For those who are not yet vaccinated, the CDC is recommending that people avoid travel if it’s not necessary.

Are D.C. schools holding classes in person?

Yes. On Tuesday, Feb. 2, students and teachers returned to in-person learning at D.C. public schools. The school system had expected more than 9,000 of its 52,000 students to return to classrooms that day, but attendance was much lower, in part because of a two-hour delay for snow. The majority of charter school students remain in virtual learning.

Various safety measures have been put in place for returning students, including grouping them in cohorts of no more than 11 people and requiring masks and social distancing. Many teachers remain opposed to returning to the classroom in person; Washington teachers union President Elizabeth Davis has told her members to show up for class if they can, and that the union would closely watch any safety complaints teachers made.

Do I have to wear a mask in public in the District?

Yes. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) strengthened the mask requirement in July, requiring everyone over the age of 2 to wear a mask in all businesses, in offices where any other people are working, in taxis or public transit vehicles, in common spaces in apartment buildings and in crowded outdoor settings. “Persons leaving their residences shall wear a mask when they are likely to come into contact with another person, such as being within six feet of another person for more than a fleeting time,” the order says.

Is it safe to eat in a restaurant, go shopping, hit the gym or attend a religious service?

Public health experts say any indoor spaces have higher transmission risks than being outdoors. Masking, social distancing and limited capacity can reduce the risk of transmission indoors, but it cannot eliminate it.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

The CDC recommends not visiting any of these places if you are feeling ill and to check in advance about mask policies.

Is it safe to eat in a tent outdoors at a restaurant?

The risk of transmission depends on who else is in the tent with you. If it’s a pod limited to only the diners in your household, your transmission risk is less than if multiple tables are seated inside the same sealed tent. Although outdoors, if the tent is closed off to the elements it could create poor ventilation akin to dining indoors. Experts recommend wearing your mask whenever not actively eating and drinking.

How is the city distributing vaccines?

The District plans to begin vaccinating everyone 16 or older beginning April 12. Currently, the city is vaccinating residents 65 and older, people 16 or older with serious health problems, such as cancer, diabetes or kidney or liver disease, people and staffers in congregate settings such as group homes and homeless shelters, and many groups of essential workers, including firefighters, police officers, health-care workers, teachers and grocery store workers. Children’s National opened a waitlist for 16- and 17-year-olds with medical conditions who qualify for the vaccine. Only 200 spots will be available on the waitlist at a time; Diana Troese, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said new spots may open daily.

The longest-running federal relationship in the city is with Giant; CVS locations in the District also joined the federal program recently.

Giant stores have had trouble using their full allotment of doses, to the point that they recently donated 1,000 doses to Johns Hopkins and batches to other hospitals and nonprofits to make sure all their doses would be used.

Residents who qualify can sign up for appointments at vaccinate.dc.gov or can call 855-363-0333 to make an appointment by phone.

Starting in March, the city began a system based on preregistration. District residents sign up for the new system either online or by phone, providing their age, health conditions, work role and Zip code. The health department will process the requests and send each person an email or text message or call them when it is their turn to sign up for a vaccine appointment. The system will continue prioritizing residents of certain Zip codes.

Senior citizens and people with qualifying health conditions in the District can also make a vaccine appointment through numerous health systems and nonprofit clinics, including Howard University, Sibley and George Washington University health systems; you can find links to those clinics’ registration pages here.

74,"Maryland has seen more than 420,000 coronavirus cases. Here’s what you need to know.","Health Secretary Dennis Schrader said he was watching the rising cases and hospitalizations closely, but he played down potential ties to Republican Gov. Larry Hogan’s decision to lift most capacity restrictions in early March.

“We don’t want to overreact,” he said. Hogan has dismissed any connection between rising rates and lifting capacity restrictions, noting Maryland’s mask mandate and social distancing rules make it difficult for many businesses to operate at full capacity. During an April 5 news conference, he blamed the increases on travel and family gatherings, saying that contagious variants have hastened the spread of the virus among the unvaccinated.

Prince George’s County increased its capacity limits for all businesses to 50 percent, and private gatherings are limited to 25 people indoors and 50 people outdoors. In Montgomery County, the outdoor gathering cap is now 50 people and the indoor gathering cap is 25 people, while houses of worship can operate at 50 percent capacity. The indoor capacity cap is 50 percent for indoor dining, fitness centers and retail establishments in the county. Entertainment facilities have been allowed to reopen at 25 percent capacity, but are not able to sell food or allow patrons to eat on the premises.

Are there enough hospital beds in Maryland?

Yes. You can find updated stats on hospital bed usage here.

Have any variants of the virus been found in Maryland?

Yes. Six different variants the CDC identified as cause for concern have been found in Maryland, though the vast majority of those detected are variants first detected in the United Kingdom. Variants first identified in South Africa, Brazil, New York and California also have been found in the state. A couple from Anne Arundel County was found to have the variant first found in the U.K. in mid-January. On Jan. 30, Hogan announced that a man in the Baltimore area was found to have the B.1.351 variant, a highly transmissible mutation of the coronavirus first found in South Africa. The man had not traveled out of the country, meaning that “community transmission” of the variant was likely, according to Hogan’s statement. On Feb. 2, Hogan said two Montgomery County residents who recently traveled abroad also tested positive for the same variant. And on Feb. 19, an inmate at the Jessup Correctional Facility was found to have the variant first found in the United Kingdom.

Maryland is the second state in the country to report a confirmed case of the South African variant; on Jan. 28, the variant was discovered in two cases in South Carolina.

How can I get tested for the virus?

Maryland has a list of available test sites on its website.

Can I travel out of state?

Maryland’s travel advisory discourages travel to any state where the case rate exceeds 20 infections per 100,000 residents. However, quarantine requirements and restrictions on out-of-state travel were lifted on March 12. The travel advisory remains in place, and the state is continuing to encourage people to get tested once they return from travel outside Maryland. Even people who are fully vaccinated are encouraged to get tested upon return. Hogan said in late March contact tracing data shows travel to Florida, the New York area and Pennsylvania area are among the most common sources of infection in Maryland.

Is it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that it’s safe to travel once you’ve been fully vaccinated against coronavirus. However, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky still says she does not recommend travel in general. “I would advocate against general travel overall,"" she said at a White House briefing April 2. ""Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel. Our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so.”

For those who are not yet vaccinated, the CDC is recommending that people avoid travel if it’s not necessary.

Are schools in Maryland holding classes in person?

Yes, schools are beginning to return to in-person instruction. Schools in Montgomery County, the state’s largest school system, welcomed back more than 19,000 children from kindergarten to third grade on March 15. Some children enrolled in special education and career programs and seniors who have grades so low they may not graduate, also returned to in-person instruction. At the beginning of March, more than 700 students had returned to classes — mostly special education and career program students. Public schools in Prince George’s County, the state’s second-largest school system, will reopen for in-class learning in April.

Do I have to wear a mask in public in Maryland?

Residents older than 5 must wear masks while indoors in public spaces and outdoors when social distancing is not possible, as well as on public transportation. See the governor’s latest order here. Failing to wear a mask is a misdemeanor subject to a fine of up to $500. The end of capacity restrictions announced in March did not end the state’s mask requirement.

Is it safe to eat in a restaurant, go shopping, hit the gym or attend a religious service?

Public-health experts say any indoor spaces have higher transmission risks than being outdoors. Masking, social distancing and limited capacity can reduce the risk of transmission indoors, but it cannot eliminate it.

The CDC recommends not visiting any of these places if you are feeling ill and to check in advance about mask policies. In Maryland, everyone over 5 is required to wear a mask indoors.

Is it safe to eat in a tent outdoors at a restaurant?

The risk of transmission depends on who else is in the tent with you. If it’s a pod limited to only the diners in your household, your transmission risk is less than if multiple tables are seated inside the same sealed tent. Although outdoors, if the tent is closed off to the elements it could create poor ventilation akin to dining indoors. Experts recommend wearing your mask whenever not actively eating and drinking.

How is Maryland distributing the vaccine?

Maryland allows all residents age 16 and older to get a shot at mass vaccination sites now and at all providers statewide beginning April 12. Between the mass vaccination sites, hospitals, pharmacies and community providers, there are more than 3,000 locations offering vaccine statewide.

Maryland has opened six mass vaccination sites earlier this year, including the first at Six Flags in Prince George’s, and will open an additional six during April. Mass vaccination sites in Hagerstown, Salisbury and at the M&T Bank Stadium site in Baltimore accept a limited number of walk-ups without appointments. The Federal Emergency Management Agency opened a vaccination clinic on April 7 at the Greenbelt Metro station in Prince George’s County, the first federally operated site in the state.

Maryland residents who are eligible to get vaccinated can find a vaccination clinic here. Preregistration for mass vaccination sites can be found here.

Social gatherings, including weddings, are able to have 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors. School graduations can have 500 people indoors and 5,000 people outdoors, or 30 percent of the venue’s capacity, whichever is less.

Have any of the variants of the virus been found in Virginia?

Yes. The virus variants that were first discovered in the United Kingdom, South Africa and California have all been found in Virginia. More transmissible, those variants have contributed to a recent surge in cases, along with looser attitudes about masks and other protective measures, epidemiologists say.. Available vaccines are thought to be effective against the variants.

Are there enough hospital beds in Virginia?

Yes. You can find updated information on hospitalizations here.

How can I get tested for the virus?

Testing locations change often, while local health departments and some private groups have been hosting pop-up testing sites for limited periods. The most up-to-date information on where to get a coronavirus test can be found here.

Can I travel out of state?

Yes, but be mindful that some states have quarantine mandates for out-of-state travelers. For example, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut include Virginia on their lists of states whose infection rates are high enough to require a 10-day quarantine period. If you’re traveling to other states, check with the state and local health departments to see if Virginia is on their list.

Is it safe to travel by airplane, train or bus?

Yes, in-person instruction is occurring. In Fairfax County, the state’s largest district, more than 84,000 students returned to in-person class the week of March 15. Loudoun County schools have seen about 36 percent of the student body return to class, or just under 30,000 students, while in Arlington, a total of about 17,000 students returned to class as of the week of March 15. Alexandria returned almost 5,400 students to in-person learning.

Do I have to wear a mask in public in Virginia?

The state’s mask mandate is still in effect. Those who are 5 and older must wear masks when indoors in areas shared with other people as well as outdoors if they are within six feet of another person.

Exemptions include eating or drinking in restaurants or taverns, exercising, a person seeking to communicate with a hearing-impaired person and anyone with a health condition that keeps them from wearing a face covering. Children older than 2 are strongly encouraged to wear a face covering when possible.

Employees inside essential business, such as a pharmacy or a restaurant, are also required to wear face coverings.

Violations of the mask order are considered a Class 1 misdemeanor and are subject to jail time and fines of as much as $2,500. The state has begun to penalize local businesses that violate the requirement by suspending food permits and other business licenses.

How is Virginia distributing vaccines?

The state’s vaccination process has been hampered by confusion after the pool of eligible recipients was expanded under what turned out to be a false expectation that the federal government would be providing those extra doses. The state’s rate of inoculations briefly ranked near the bottom in the country before a push by Northam’s administration brought that rate up to where most states are.

Story continues below advertisement

Virginia has created a statewide registration system for residents to register for vaccine appointments. Residents can also call 1-877-VAX-IN-VA to register. However, since Fairfax County has opted out of the state system, residents of that county must continue to register for appointments here. And those seeking to get vaccinated through CVS must still register through that pharmacy’s website, which is not connected with the statewide system. Commercial pharmacies are starting to administer doses to a wider range of people: those ages 16 to 64 with high-risk medical conditions, as well as front-line essential workers, including police officers, mail carriers, public transit workers and ride-share drivers.

Health-care workers and residents of long-term-care facilities were the first to get vaccinated. Virginia is now offering doses to residents 65 and older, those who are 16 or older and have underlying medical conditions and most essential workers — including health-care workers, teachers, firefighters, police officers, restaurant employees and child-care workers. Vaccine supplies are increasing, but some jurisdictions are closer than others in meeting Northam’s April 18 deadline for everyone 16 and older to become eligible for vaccination.

Nearly $40 million in federal Cares Act funds will go toward helping people who are uninsured or underinsured receive vaccinations. Local health officials will be tasked with getting the vaccine to any non-federally recognized tribal communities.

76,"L'Auberge Chez Francois restaurant review: It's ready for its close-up, yet again","As my party makes its way to the entrance, the crunch of gravel beneath our feet blends with the music of people happy to finally be celebrating special occasions that these days extend to complete vaccinations. If anything seems off, it’s the stream of fellow diners dressed for dinner in suits and dresses, which look quaint in an ongoing pandemic.

Otherwise, my arrival unfolds as it has for all the times I’ve visited the dining destination, which this month celebrates its 45th anniversary. Just as Francois Haeringer did before he died, son Jacques stands outside the restaurant in crisp chef’s whites, chatting up customers.

This being spring, waiters in red jackets with gold buttons dart in and out of the kitchen to ferry drinks from the bar and dishes from the kitchen to those of us wishing to dine alfresco.

L’Auberge Chez Francois emerged in March from what Haeringer calls “hibernation,” but in reality was six weeks spent sprucing up the Alsatian-inspired retreat. “The only thing on the list I didn’t get done was a tummy tuck,” jokes the owner, 71, whose staff did much of the painting, staining and landscaping on the bucolic, six-acre property. One of the many lessons of the pandemic is the need for more outdoor seating. The owner responded with an expanded stone terrace covered by a tent, which is where my posse gathered last month for a socially distanced stroll down memory lane.

With a notable exception, the menu is pretty much what I remember writing about a decade ago, and 10 years before that. It’s a time capsule outfitted with chateaubriand for two and baked Alaska. For as long as I can remember, L’Auberge Chez Francois has specialized in French classics spread across four courses interspersed with treats from the kitchen for a set price.

The service doesn’t just ring a bell, it sounds a gong. Dinner continues to be delivered by people who clearly enjoy what they’re doing and look out for customers’ interests.

“Remember, if you can’t finish a bottle, Virginia allows you to take unfinished wine home,” a server informs us. After he rattles off a list of possible flavors for a souffle, he adds, “maybe I can ask if they can make a lemon souffle if you want.”

In a testament to their employer, all but one of 80 staff members returned to their jobs after the winter pause, says Haeringer.

The biggest change on the menu reflects an industry forced to remind itself that restaurants are a business, says Haeringer. Prices are up 10 percent or so from before the pandemic, partly to make up for the loss of half the seating. The chef has resisted adding hospitality charges to checks, as many restaurants have done to address safety costs and higher food prices.

Routines were upended last year. L’Auberge Chez Francois demonstrates their value, as when garlic toast and herbed cottage cheese appear on the table, just as they have always kicked off a meal. We expect something to happen, and it does! Close behind the bread service, another vanishing restaurant practice, is a little taste of soup, tonight a light split pea soup that acknowledges a cool evening.

From there, it’s just a hop, skip and a jump to first courses, which for me comes down to either Burgundy snails bathed in garlic butter and parsley or a seafood salad from Poseidon’s pantry: chilled crab, shrimp, scallops, lobster and salmon lightly bound in rémoulade. A crisp-edged chive crepe comes with a filling of mushroom duxelles and a side dollop of tomato concasse for tang and shade.

The lone disappointment is a savory tart topped with a fan of dense apple slices, a blob of half-melted Roquefort and a single raspberry. It tastes the way it looks: amateur.

Doilies hold the appetizers in place on their plates. Of course they do.

L’Auberge Chez Francois saves flights of fancy for special events, such as wine dinners. Give or take a seasonal garnish or ingredient, its regular menu is all about tradition and consistency.

“If you want culinary adventure,” says Haeringer, “there’s a place for that” — just not his place. While the pandemic has sent a few dishes packing — the many parts for choucroute haven’t been easy to come by, says Haeringer, who has temporarily removed the classic — most of the standbys are standing by.

Here’s the place to feast on fish: crisp trout strewn with slivered almonds or, finer still, Dover sole sweetened with sauteed lobster. Rack of lamb is straightforward. When it comes to meat, my preference is for thin slices of veal paved with country ham and finished with sweet crab. The kitchen springs for rich flourishes. A neat row of sliced mushrooms, sprinkled with capers, dresses the sole, which, like other entrees, is framed with a pretty garden of alternating carrots, Brussels sprouts and potatoes.

This is not a rushed meal. As always, dinner, which includes a choice of salads, is punctuated by a sorbet at halftime. Per custom, dessert — anything involving meringue is good — is trailed by excellent chocolate truffles. If you need to stretch your legs, there’s the green expanse to check out and restrooms to visit. The latter bring you to a basement hallway that doubles as a gallery paying homage to a restaurant that originally opened as Chez Francois in Washington in 1954. (Francois Haeringer relocated to Great Falls in 1976 and remained a presence in the kitchen until his death, at 91, in 2010. The more casual Jacques’ Brasserie was added to the equation the next year.)

A seat on the terrace is weather-dependent and without heaters, details shared by a friendly receptionist who sounds as if you’re the only party she’s calling to confirm a reservation. (To those who have complained about the chill, this cold-weather fan suggests dressing in layers.) A table in the great outdoors shows off the cheery red shutters of the white facade, the windows of which frame some of the action within the timbered, honey-lit main dining room. I envy the insiders only until the sun begins to set and the sky goes from pink to blue to periwinkle.

“Business has been great!” says Haeringer, when I later ask him on the phone. “It turns out it wasn’t the end of the world.”

Same old, same old? I’ll take it — gladly — at L’Auberge Chez Francois.

Expect virtual events to continue alongside those in the real world for the foreseeable future. But the next few months, full of festivals, sports, and outdoor fun, promise a safe, and cautious, return to something better.

What outdoor activities are available right now?

Health experts agree that outdoor activities are safer than those indoors, which might be why there are so many ways to enjoy the fresh air. Nature centers are reopening, along with hikes and events for all ages; Montgomery County is reinstalling basketball hoops in parks, more than a year after it took them down to prevent players from gathering; and Arlington and Fairfax counties have resumed dance classes — holding them outside instead of in studios. Here’s a sampling of some other things you can do right now and in the weeks ahead.

Boating in D.C., which manages eight locations, including the Key Bridge, Fletcher’s and National Harbor boathouses, is already renting kayaks, canoes and stand-up paddleboards at its Wharf boathouse, with others expected to open April 10. In Prince George’s County, Bladensburg Waterfront Park and Patuxent River Park began renting canoes and kayaks on April 3, and Patuxent River Park has guided kayak tours on April 22 and May 22.

D.C.’s waterfront fitness classes are making a comeback: The Hustle bike classes are back on the water taxi pier at the Wharf on Saturdays and Sundays. The Fitness at the Front series, previously held in Canal Park and Yards Park, returns in May, with exercise classes offered three times per week. On Saturdays from April 17 to May 1, Brunch on the Go in Yards Park offers stretching and a run led by Pacers, followed by a champagne brunch for two at a choice of nearby restaurants.

Beginning May 1, indoor and outdoor pools in D.C. are allowed to reopen at 50 percent capacity, while splash pads can operate at full capacity. The water features in Yards and Canal parks will be operational by Memorial Day.

Good news for runners and cyclists: Roads that were closed to automobile traffic at the beginning of the pandemic, including sections of Beach Drive in Rock Creek Park and portions of Little Falls and Sligo Creek parkways in Montgomery County, remain closed to cars and available to bikes and pedestrians.

What’s the status of outdoor festivals, wine tastings, etc.?

As we saw with this year’s National Cherry Blossom Festival, event organizers are walking a tightrope, mixing a series of virtual events with safer, in-person activities. The seven-year-old Funk Parade is adapting this hybrid approach: The main festival on May 8, with performances from area musicians, dancers and artists, will be virtual instead of filling clubs around U Street NW. The celebration also includes in-person events, including a beer tasting at Alexandria’s Aslin Beer Company on May 1, and a guided tour of U Street murals on May 5.

Beer and wine festivals look a little different, too. Caboose Brewing’s Springfest, held at Caboose Commons in Fairfax on April 17, ditches the usual lines and chaos for a setup closer to a beer dinner. Participants sit at socially distanced picnic tables and, over the course of two hours, brewers and representatives from seven different Virginia breweries, including Rocket Frog and Vasen, come around to each table for guided tastings of two of their beers — that’s samples of 14 beers in all — and a Q&A with each group. (Caboose compares this to brewery speed dating.) Guests can’t be seated with strangers, so you have to reserve a whole table, at $45 to $50 per person.

The Capitol Riverfront, which has turned Yards Park and Canal Park into destinations for summer fun in recent years, is keeping up a stream of boozy social events in coming months, including the returns of Rosé All Day and Tiki Yards, though they’ll be modified to prevent crowding. The wine-centric VineYards, taking place April 22 and 23, is a wine-pairing event that can be done in-person at restaurants around Yards Park, or as a takeout meal with videos from sommeliers and winemakers discussing the pairings. (Either way, it’s $150 for two people.)

I still don’t like the idea of watching movies in theaters. Are outdoor movies happening this year?

Drive-in theaters were the surprise retro hit of 2020, offering a socially distanced alternative to the packed, popular outdoor neighborhood movie series that draw crowds in town and around the suburbs. While summer is the peak season, there are still chances to enjoy blockbusters and family favorites from the comfort of your own car. The Alexandria Drive-In, which made a splash last summer, returns to the vast parking lot of the Victory Center on Eisenhower Avenue on Fridays and Saturdays, with movies ideal for families (“Trolls”) and adults (“Deadpool”). Admission is $40 per car, with snacks sold from food trucks.

Park Up DC, which brought a 60-foot high-definition screen to an RFK Stadium parking lot with room for hundreds of cars last summer, kicks off its spring programming this weekend with comedy and a screening of the El Clásico match between Barcelona and Real Madrid. Plans for the movie series are still being finalized. The Capitol Riverfront Drive-In Movie Series, which launched in a parking lot south of Audi Field in the fall, returns April 23 for a six-week run.

Don’t have a car? Not a problem. The Bullpen beer garden, known as a pregame destination down the street from Nationals Park, occasionally welcomes crowds to watch movies on a jumbo screen from distanced picnic tables. Last month brought a Harry Potter film series; this weekend’s Flicks and Rosé includes “Bridesmaids” (April 9) and “Crazy Stupid Love” (April 10). The schedule varies, but it’s worth keeping an eye on. Last summer, the Evening Star Cafe in Del Ray converted its rear parking lot into an attractive, turf-covered area dubbed “the Back Yard” to increase its outdoor dining space. A weekly movie night began in the fall: a chance to hang out and watch “Top Gun,” “Big” or “The Incredibles” on Wednesday nights. (There are a dozen tables, including four cabanas, so reservations are suggested. There is no cover charge.)

What’s happening with live music?

Once again, the area’s biggest outdoor venues are showing empty calendars as we approach summer concert season, but there are reasons for hope. The Kennedy Center “will be having outdoor and physically distant performances and activities late spring and summer,” similar to last year’s Sunset Concerts at the Reach, according to a spokesperson for the performing arts venue. Under Virginia’s Phase 3 guidelines, Wolf Trap could welcome up to 1,000 patrons. In D.C., the mayor’s latest guidelines allow restaurants and bars to offer live music at outdoor areas beginning May 1, though there are still some questions about how it will work.

Venues that hosted outdoor concerts in the summer are bringing them back. Jammin Java’s schedule is heavy on bands performing in the Vienna club’s parking lot Wednesday through Sunday, with some “indoor and distanced” shows mixed in. The State Theatre’s lineup mixes cover bands and comedy at its free shows, held Wednesday through Sunday outside the Falls Church concert hall. Near Nationals Park, the Bullpen plans to host concerts this summer for fans seated at picnic tables, including local favorites White Ford Bronco.

Of course, the music continues indoors, as well: The Birchmere, JV’s Restaurant and Rams Head On Stage have welcomed bands throughout the winter. D.C.’s Hamilton Live is taking a hybrid approach: The downtown venue recently began offering concerts for a small number of seated fans, but is also live-streaming events for those who feel more comfortable watching from home. Expect the number of indoor shows in D.C. to increase after May 1, when venues can began hosting live entertainment at 25 percent capacity, up to 500 people.

Have restaurants and bars that closed for the winter reopened?

Last fall, after nightlife entrepreneurs Eric and Ian Hilton announced they were closing a number of their bars “for the foreseeable future” — including such D.C. mainstays as the Gibson and the Brixton — some wondered whether they’d ever reopen. But as longer days have returned, so have most of the bars. American Ice Company resumed pouring picklebacks and dishing up queso-covered nachos on April 1; the video game-filled Players Club followed on April 7; and Victura Park, the massive wine garden at the Kennedy Center’s Reach, returns this weekend, with the Brixton reopening in the next week or so, according to Ian Hilton.

It has been an anxious winter for bar and restaurant owners, especially those who don’t have substantial outdoor space. Recent weeks have seen more bars emerge from months-long hibernation, including U Street dive Solly’s; Mid-Atlantic-inspired Chinatown basement Free State; and Shaw beer garden Electric Cool-Aid, one of the brightest new additions of 2020, which is serving a new menu of tropical-inspired drinks. Bloomingdale’s Boundary Stone announced it is reopening on April 15, sparking tweets of joy. Others that had survived the winter by going takeout-only, such as Ivy and Coney and Archipelago, are once again offering guests outdoor seats.

On the other hand, we have yet to hear reopening dates for staples like the Passenger or Room 11, which closed in November with the promise of reopening in the spring, “perhaps with a new look or a new name.” And let’s not forget it’s been over a year since anyone’s perused the draft list at ChurchKey or slammed a shot at the Pug.

What else is happening with outdoor dining?

Outdoor dining is much more appealing now that we’re free from plastic igloos and greenhouse-style huts. Because restaurants across the area are operating at a fraction of their indoor capacity, most jurisdictions are continuing outdoor dining programs that proved popular last summer. From Alexandria to Bethesda to Rockville, streets have been closed to make room for additional dining, though it’s worth checking before you go: Old Town Fairfax has not brought back its City Square program, and Annapolis’s Recovery Zones have changed which streets are closed on which days.

John Logan to order a picnic basket, sandwiches or appetizers, which is delivered by bike Wednesday through Sunday.

When are live theater and comedy coming back?

Mayor Muriel E. Bowser’s recent orders allow theaters to offer live entertainment starting May 1, subject to a 25 percent capacity limit, or 500 attendees, whichever is smaller. So far, GALA Hispanic Theatre — which hosted in-person performances of “El Perro del Hortelano” in the fall as part of D.C.’s entertainment pilot program — is the only major theater to announce dates for live productions. “Tía Julia y el escribidor” (“Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter”), based on the novel by Nobel Prize winner Mario Vargas Llosa, runs from April 22 to May 9, followed by “Aliens, Immigrants, & Other Evildoers,” which opens May 14. Only 50 tickets are sold for each performance, putting the theater at 18 percent capacity, with patrons at every fifth seat.

Most other theaters, such as Signature, Woolly Mammoth and Arena Stage, are committed to virtual theater seasons. Arena is turning into a high-capacity vaccination site, beginning this weekend. Some smaller venues insist the show must go on: Annapolis’s Colonial Players open “Maytag Virgin” Friday, with only 30 audience members. The show runs through April 25 and is also available for streaming instead of in-person attendance. In Columbia, Toby’s Dinner Theatre is also humming, with “Shrek the Musical” through June 13. The traditional buffet, though, has been suspended.

Unlike theater, there are plenty of options for comedy. The D.C. Improv, the city’s most notable comedy club, reopens April 15 with a three-night/six-show stand by Erin Jackson, who honed her skills at D.C. open mics before moving to New York. Only 50 tickets are available for each performance. For those who don’t want to gather inside, Donnell Rawlings, Joe Clair, Red Grant and Dominique are visiting Park Up DC, the pop-up drive-in theater on the RFK Stadium grounds, for four shows Friday and Saturday.

In Virginia, the Arlington Cinema and Drafthouse is back in business, hosting comedians who have been featured on “Last Comic Standing,” Comedy Central or late-night talk shows, while operating at 30 percent capacity. (Its sister D.C. venue, Drafthouse Comedy, closed permanently in December.) The Improv has been organizing shows with local talent at the Tally-Ho Theater in Leesburg since January.

The Washington Nationals will play in front of 5,000 socially distanced fans, at least at first, with the crowd consisting primarily of season ticket holders sitting in pods of up to six people. Bowser has indicated that the city will consider raising the capacity in the future. If you just want to see baseball, and you don’t mind a drive, the Baltimore Orioles have single-game tickets available in April and May, including home stands against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees.

The Bowie Baysox, the Orioles’ Class AA affiliate, expect “between 25 to 30 percent capacity” at the 10,000-seat Prince George’s County Stadium for the team’s May 11 home opener, according to assistant general manager Phil Wrye. Tickets for single games go on sale April 26.

D.C. United has permission for 2,000 fans to watch games at Audi Field, beginning April 17, but, like the Nationals, that number is a fraction of the team’s season ticket holders, and no single-game tickets are on sale. Leesburg’s Segra Field, home to USL Championship club Loudoun United, is allowed to have up to 1,000 fans at matches. Of note: The NWSL’s Washington Spirit, which splits its home games between Segra and Audi fields, has not announced a regular season schedule, but the team will play two NWSL Challenge Cup matches at Audi Field. The April 27 match against NJ/NY Gotham FC (formerly Sky Blue FC) will have spectators. Any tickets not sold to the Spirit’s Full 90 Club members will go on sale April 15.

Indoor sports are a different proposition. At an April 5 news conference, Bowser said she expected a decision to be made “soon” about when fans might return to Capitals and Wizards games at Capital One Arena. The same day, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, which owns the teams and has asked to be allowed to allow 10 percent capacity, said in a statement that it does not expect fans to attend any games this year. (Both the NHL and NBA regular seasons end in May, and Capitals playoff tickets are hard enough to get when the building’s at full capacity.)",0
78,"Chicago food critics retire, leaving the city’s dining scene without a key ingredient","“The Tribune review was a huge deal,” a gauge to see “how you compared to the greats and where things aligned,” says Flamm, 35, a “Top Chef” champion who is poised to open his maiden restaurant April 20. Named after his grandmothers and more than two years in the making, Rose Mary will showcase Croatian and Italian dishes in Fulton Market.

“I would have loved to get a Phil Vettel review under my belt,” says the chef, imagining a splash on the front page of the Tribune’s Dining section.

“It’s sad to see Phil and Steve go,” says Sarah Grueneberg, the James Beard award-winning chef at Monteverde Restaurant & Pastificio in the West Loop. “They were such great champions of our food scene, and people have been following them for decades.”

To Karrie Leung, founder of PR and marketing agency KLPR, the loss of local reviews has an outsize impact: From a national perspective, it “removes Chicago from that playing field,” she says. “When you lose critics, people you know and trust, that’s a hard pill to swallow.”

Who raves or rants about restaurants in town might seem like small potatoes amid an ongoing pandemic. Yet as diners continue to look to restaurants for comfort and the city is opening up, in-depth reviewing feels paramount. Vettel, a former president of the restaurant awards committee of the James Beard Foundation, goes so far as to say that without a strong voice and sufficient resources to bring its dining scene attention, Chicago risks “becoming a flyover city.”

Grueneberg laughs when she says “our hobbies are sports, food and alcohol,” but a serious case could be made for Chicago as a top-tier place to eat, drink and be merry — and for why the nation’s third-largest city needs passionate chroniclers of the dining scene who know what they’re talking about and have the resources to offer their educated opinion, free of outside influence.

The opposite of that, says Dolinsky, also a regional academy chair for the World’s 50 Best Restaurants: “the same six or seven recommendations from Instagrammers looking at well-known restaurant groups” that can afford to offer comped meals or other perks. Both Dolinsky and Vettel had budgets to dine out and declined freebies.

Count me a fan of Chicago. In search of the country’s best food cities in 2015 — a year-long project that examined creativity, community, ingredients, shopping, service and tradition in each market — I ranked Chicago seventh out of 10 destinations. The city offered top-notch everyman food (my weakness was hot dogs “dragged through the garden”) as well as fine dining on par with the country’s best.

While it’s had some detractors, the Windy City is second only to New York for the recognition it has received from the James Beard Foundation, more than 80 culinary awards. Save for the pause created by the pandemic, Chicago has hosted the foundation’s glitzy annual gala since 2014, and will continue to do so through 2027.

Given a chance to brag, chefs say the region’s open arms contribute to the scene’s allure. “I’ve eaten around the country. Midwestern hospitality is the best,” says Erick Williams, the owner of the Southern-accented Virtue in Hyde Park. The chef says he overhears visitors praise the city when he encounters them on elevators and in airports.

Local praise inevitably leads to national recognition, says chef Beverly Kim, who co-owns the Korean-American Parachute, currently under renovation, and Wherewithall, serving community meals by day and Parachute’s takeout by night. Parachute, for instance, “depended on 70 percent national business: D.C., San Francisco, New York.” Kim says, “I stayed in the city for a reason. Sure, the winters are cold, but there’s room for growth in Chicago.”

In an essay for Chicago Eater rooting for critical coverage of restaurants, former Chicago Sun-Times and RedEye critic Michael Nagrant wrote about the trickle-down effect from visitors chasing elite restaurants based on glowing reviews: Patrons “eat at other restaurants, influenced when the chef or general manager tells a table, ‘You gotta check out the Isaan sausage at Spoon Thai and the chapli kebab at Khan BBQ!’ A rising tide lifts all ships, not just the luxury yachts in Monaco.”

There are plenty of places for food-loving locals to get the scoop on area restaurants: Chicago Eater, Chicago Magazine, Infatuation, Resy and Yelp. (Jeff Ruby, the veteran critic for Chicago Magazine, last filed a column in March 2020. Headlined “The Last Supper,” it looked at RPM Seafood.) The Tribune has four reporters assigned to the dining beat, and recently tapped Ariel Cheung, previously the publication’s real estate editor, as Dining editor.

But for thoughtful and balanced critiques, based on multiple visits, “the Chicago Tribune is the standard of approval,” Kim says. She and her peers are concerned by social media influencers replacing “trained voices” — writers with the expertise, including historical knowledge, and the budget and time to do the job right.

For much of his run, Vettel, who says he “tried to write about a restaurant’s story, why it mattered and why now, “dined out for work an average of five nights a week. “I was supposed to tell people the best things in Chicago.” That included Ever, the 10-course, $285 tasting menu concept from chef Curtis Duffy and Vettel’s last star-rated review. (Ever got four.) Did I mention restaurant criticism can be expensive?

Williams, who says he uses criticism in reviews as “a training tool” in his restaurants, dismisses “amateur voices built around sensationalism.” Such output “doesn’t offer the clearest perspective or a level of integrity.”

The chef applies what he calls “the sink analogy” to people who think an appetite and a camera qualify them to review: “I have unclogged a sink. I’ve changed a few washers and even routed a sink or two during [restaurant] service. But that doesn’t qualify me to be a plumber.”

Dolinsky, who now brands himself as a content producer and consultant and retains a presence on YouTube, was known for covering the city’s nooks and crannies. He says his employer told him to cover Chicago however he wanted to, which meant recommending a rainbow of paletas at Razpachos and Polish cooking at Smakosz. (His segment, which played in taxi cabs, “introduced travelers to the city’s riches,” Flamm says.)

“I had an ample dining budget and wasn’t obligated to do a story,” says Dolinsky, also the author of “Pizza City, USA: 101 Reasons Why Chicago Is America’s Greatest Pizza Town.” “If it was on the air, it was highly recommended.”

Restaurants featured on his show received a photo of Dolinsky and a certificate, which subjects frequently displayed as a seal of approval from a professional diner. “It validates a business,” says Eddie Nero, the owner of Big Ed’s BBQ in the suburb of Waukegan.

A rave can also save a restaurant. The original Big Ed’s, opened in 2008 in North Chicago, was struggling until it got featured on “Hungry Hound,” Nero says. Immediately after the segment aired, the phone started ringing and cars showed up. “We weren’t prepared,” says Nero, who ran out of food hours before closing time. “Business tripled overnight.”

ABC 7 didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment, but Dolinsky, who produced, reported, shot and edited his own work, said, “I’d be very surprised if ABC replaced me.”

At the Tribune, managers haven’t had to think about who would be eating for its readers as chief critic since George H.W. Bush was president. Vettel’s departure — and a totally changed media and social landscape since he started dining out for work — handed the company an opportunity to rethink coverage.

“Restaurant criticism isn’t going anywhere,” says Amy Carr, director of content/life and culture at the Tribune. But it is likely to look different. She and Cheung, the new Dining editor, have a bench of talent on staff (“it’s important for us to develop personalities,” says Carr) but are open to the possibility of involving the community in future reviews. Neighbors sharing stories would “give it a different perspective,” Carr says.

As they strategize, inclusion and diversity are at the top of their wish list, every bit as important as a passion for food. Cheung says she’s looking for “stories that reflect a complete view of the city.” Good groundwork has been laid by Vettel and Dining colleagues, she says. “I’ll be making sure that that work gets amplified.” The editors hope to finalize their strategy this month.

Vettel’s news-making departure coincided with that of the Tribune’s Pulitzer Prize-winning architecture critic, Blair Kamin, whose position has not been filled. “If they replace me, it will probably be from within,” Vettel says.

Elsewhere in the country, fresh eyes have been recruited to reimagine or bolster restaurant coverage. In 2018, Soleil Ho replaced longtime critic Michael Bauer at the San Francisco Chronicle, and Tejal Rao became the New York Times’ first California restaurant reviewer. The same year, Bill Addison and Patricia Escárcega replaced the late Jonathan Gold as co-critics at the Los Angeles Times. (Escárcega recently left the publication following a pay-equity dispute.)

In Chicago, the impact of the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements is made clear when the subjects of restaurant reviews are asked what they’d like to see in any future critics.

As with the industry, says Kim, “let’s bring back the best things and fix the worst.” Grateful as she says she is for Dolinsky and Vettel, “they’re still men.”

Nero is hoping for someone with food knowledge and a sense of humor. The chef, who is Black, says he would also like to see “someone who looks like me. That would mean a lot.”

Williams expects “someone who cut their teeth already. What are you comparing this to? Why should we care?” The chef says, “I would like to see a woman,” possibly a minority. Either or both would bring “a different sensibility” to the table.

Might more be more? Leung, the publicist, advances the idea of co-critics, “not just one person,” but “a panel.”

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot recently gave the green light to bars and restaurants by allowing them to increase indoor capacity to 50 percent and remain open until 1 a.m. Their owners are hungry to return to some kind of normal, restaurant critics included.

Referencing the famous chef behind Chicago’s trailblazing Alinea, Vettel asks, “When the next Grant Achatz comes up, who’s going to tell people? ... Is it going to be Yelp?”",0
79,"It’s a fine old Maryland house, and it’s next door to Chevy Chase Club","The Chevy Chase house was built for George Gilpin Perkins, who was a circuit court judge in Kentucky before spending five years practicing law in New York City. Perkins retired to the estate he called Greenacre, where he wrote a memoir titled “A Kentucky Judge.”

Perkins, a member of Chevy Chase Club, was an avid golfer. He established the Perkins Plate, an award for senior golfers at the club. It is no longer contested.

Rudolph M. Kauffmann bought the house in 1923. Kauffmann was the grandson of Samuel Hay Kauffmann, the first president of the Evening Star newspaper, and son of Rudolph Kauffmann, its managing editor. Rudolph M. Kauffmann was a vice president and an editor at the newspaper. He also was a trustee of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, a director of Children’s Hospital and a member of Chevy Chase Club.

Kauffmann’s maternal grandfather was a native of Scotland and taught him to play the bagpipes.

“He was known throughout Chevy Chase Village for going out on Sunday mornings with his bagpipes and playing his bagpipes in the yard,” said Alec Smith, the fifth and current owner of the house. “It would echo across the village. I’m not sure that would be all that well received, but nobody told me it was not enjoyed.”

During the Kauffmanns’ ownership, the gardens were featured twice on the Chevy Chase Garden Club tour.

Real estate investor Robert Waggaman bought the house in 1958. Waggaman, also a member of Chevy Chase Club, lived in the house with his wife and five children.

Lawyer Robert E. Freer Jr. bought the house in 1983, the year it was featured as the National Symphony Orchestra Decorators’ Show House. Freer, who founded the Free Enterprise Foundation, was a member of Chevy Chase Club.

When Smith and his family went to look at the house in 2001, the real estate agent didn’t think it was the house for them. She was wrong.

“My wife and I walked in the front door, we stood in the front hall and we looked right into the dining room and left into the living room,” Smith said. “We looked at each other and said, ‘This is it.’ ”

The house may have captivated them on first sight, but its location was also a factor.

“I bought it because we were members of the Chevy Chase Club, right next door,” Smith said. “There’s a gate that goes onto the property.”

For someone who grew up in historical homes in Alexandria, Va., the house was the right mix of old and new.

“I have an enormous appreciation for American architecture and American furniture,” he said. “Actually, we kidded about this being a ‘new’ house.”

When the Smiths decided to expand the house in 2006, they hired architect Cliff Elmore and builder Mauck Zantzinger & Associates to add gathering spaces on the main and lower levels and renovate the kitchen and a bathroom. They expanded the kitchen by doing away with the butler’s pantry and moving the cabinetry from the pantry to the basement.

“The bones of the house are amazing,” Smith said. “One of the things you do in Alexandria is you don’t disturb the historic material. And so we worked very hard not to muck anything up.”

The house retains many of its original features, such as parquet floors with border inlays, operable glass door transoms and door hardware.

The seven-bedroom, five-bathroom, 8,860-square-foot house is listed at just under $4.8 million.

81,Fixed mortgage rates upward march halted as they fall for the first time in 7 weeks,"Freddie Mac, the federally chartered mortgage investor, aggregates rates from around 80 lenders across the country to come up with weekly national average mortgage rates. It uses rates for high-quality borrowers with strong credit scores and large down payments. Because of the criteria, these rates are not available to every borrower.

Story continues below advertisement

The survey is based on home purchase mortgages, which means rates for refinances may be higher. The price adjustment for refinance transactions that went into effect in December is adding to the cost. The adjustment, which applies to all Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac refinances, is 0.5 percent of the loan amount. That works out to $1,500 on a $300,000 loan.

The 15-year fixed-rate average slid to 2.42 percent with an average 0.6 point. It was 2.45 percent a week ago and 2.77 percent a year ago. The five-year adjustable rate average rose to 2.92 percent with an average 0.1 point. It was 2.84 percent a week ago and 3.4 percent a year ago.

“Mortgage rates fell this week, holding firm even as key economic data reports show signs of continued improvement,” said Matthew Speakman, a Zillow economist. “Rates have paused their consistent ascent several times in the past few months, but for the first time since the beginning of the year, there are some indications that this reprieve from rates’ upward trend could be a lasting one. … With coronavirus cases beginning to rise again in most U.S. states and many countries around the world, investors have a renewed reason for caution, which tends to push bond yields, and mortgage rates, downward.”

The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which climbed to 1.73 percent on Monday, has since fallen back to 1.68 percent.

The minutes from the Federal Reserve meeting in March were released this week. In them, central bank officials indicated optimism about the economic recovery but signaled they would keep interest rates low through 2023 and continue their bond-buying program. Since early in the pandemic, the Fed has been buying $120 billion in bonds each month, which has held down mortgage rates.

The Fed doesn’t set mortgage rates, but its decisions can sway investors. Mortgage rates are influenced more by investors’ expectations. Good economic news is often bad for rates because a strong economy prompts concern about inflation. Inflation causes bonds to lose value and yields to rise.

Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found more than half of the experts it surveyed expect rates to remain about the same in the coming week.

“Mortgage interest rates have been creeping higher for well over a month,” said Elizabeth Rose, sales manager at AmCap Mortgage in Dallas. “Finally, it looks as though mortgage bonds may have caught a break. Mortgage bonds have broken the trend and are making a strong attempt at bouncing. While a modest improvement in rates is possible, it could be short lived. It is more likely that rates will hang onto the improvement and trend sideways.”

Meanwhile, mortgage applications were down for the fifth week in a row. According to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the market composite index — a measure of total loan application volume — decreased 5.1 percent from a week earlier. The purchase index fell 4 percent from the previous week, and the refinance index dropped 5 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity accounted for 60.3 percent of applications.

With mortgage rates rising, refinance demand has retreated. Refinance volume has dropped by more than 30 percent over the past 10 weeks.

“The ongoing improvement in the economy and labor market is fueling buyer demand,” said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. “Applications to buy a home decreased last week, but activity during the first quarter of 2021 outpaced year-ago levels. … With mortgage rates rising to the highest level since last June, borrower demand for refinances continues to cool.”

The MBA also released its mortgage credit availability index (MCAI) that showed credit availability increased in March. The MCAI ticked up to 125.4 last month, rising by 0.6 percent. An increase in the MCAI indicates lending standards are loosening, while a decrease signals they are tightening.

“Credit availability inched higher in March, driven by the ongoing economic and job market recovery,” Joel Kan, an MBA economist, said in a statement. “This has increased the amount of low credit score and high [loan-to-value] products. All the market segments covered by our subindexes increased over the month, notably government and jumbo indexes. The government index, which includes FHA, VA, and [Rural Housing Service] mortgages, increased for the sixth time in seven months to its highest level in a year. … Jumbo credit supply increased for the sixth consecutive month, a strong rebound after many lenders pulled back in the first half of 2020 at the onset of the pandemic.”",0
82,"Pandemic sheds: Families find silence, storage and solace","The cozy, sturdy structure in our backyard that my husband built last year has cycled through several names, some of them even before the walls were up. At first, we called it the “learnin’ shed,” planned for our kids’ distance learning. Then it was the “instead shed,” built with money for a trip to France that the pandemic canceled. For a time, he jokingly referred to it as his mistress because of the amount of time he devoted to it, and one day I called it the “medished,” when he Zoom-taught a medical class in it. When the pandemic is over, it will be my writer’s studio (I’ve been promised).

My husband was not alone in turning to shed building in the middle of the pandemic. Some people needed to extend their living space to gain privacy and avoid cabin fever. Others finally had time to devote to a previously planned shed, or were creating a workspace. Still others needed a project to take their minds off a relentless news cycle.

Whatever you call them, these one-room shacks of 2020 have been a hot commodity. And they constitute visual reminders of our battle with covid-19 — small buildings crafted in challenging times to fulfill the needs of families stuck at home for weeks or even months on end. A century from now, real estate listings may include the quaint notation that the property includes a “pandemic shed.”

And Chris Cockrell, 53, of Orem, Utah, stood ready to hand off plans for these sheds through his company iCreatables.com. “I noticed my business was doing better because of covid,” says Cockrell, an entrepreneur. “But then I started connecting the dots that the landscape of the U.S. is changing, how we think about work and where it needs to happen. I have a solution a lot of people have turned to.”

Cockrell’s sheds come in more than a dozen styles, including Saltbox, Gambrel Barn, Cape Cod and Colonial, with variations for size, door placement and other details. The plans can be downloaded from his site for $16 to $61, or Cockrell will mail hard copies for a little more money, if people don’t have a printer. Backyard builders can also find shed plans online at mybackyardplans.com, todaysplans.net, construct101.com and shedplans.org, among others.

[How the pandemic has changed the way we see and use our homes — maybe forever]

Cockrell’s “Complete Backyard Shed Build in 3 Minutes” YouTube video condenses a one-hour tutorial into a time lapse showing him in jeans, T-shirt and ball cap building a garden shed. It has more than 3.6 million views (including 1.6 million views since September). “There’s a phenomenon happening here, and I’m in it,” he says. “It’s kind of cool I’m in a place where I can help.”

The Compound

Dean Jenkins, 59, used to drive five hours from his home to his lot on the Oregon coast where he and his wife, Melanie Hantze, 66, would retreat once a month for a few days.

“We always just parked our RV there,” Jenkins says. “But they don’t age well. They rust, start leaking. Mice get in, and pretty soon it’s nasty. We loved having a simple little place at the coast and didn’t want to build a house. Literally, one day we were just sitting there ... and I said, ‘You know, a shed would be about as big as this.’ ”

One of Jenkins’s sheds includes a kitchen and a king-size bed. (Josh Partee/For The Washington Post)

So he built two of Cockrell’s modern studio sheds, modifying one to make it smaller, and connected them with a wooden walkway. Both have electricity and plumbing, and he sidestepped the need for a building permit because neither is over 200 square feet. “There was a sense of getting away with something,” he says. “There’s a smugness: ‘Wasn’t that clever!’ ”

Jenkins began the project in 2018 and finished it during the pandemic. “We can’t do anything else,” he says, so he had time to work on the compound. One shed contains a bedroom with a king-size bed and a kitchen with a range, fridge and counter. Five feet away, the second structure boasts a full bathroom and storage space. He created a patio cover for firewood and lawn furniture, and a firepit “to sit by the fire on a nice evening and look out at the water.”

It’s been a haven of sorts for the couple, particularly now. “You get cabin fever at home and can’t do social gatherings like you normally would,” Jenkins says. “One day is like another day, and you think it would be good to have a change.”

He says that the road trip to get there is an adventure because it’s a chance to leave the house, and that there’s something “magical” about being on the water. “And even in winter if it’s raining hard, it’s got a tin roof,” he says. “You lie in bed and hear the rain on the roof while you’re cozy and dry.”

“Because I made it for the kids, it adds a different level of emotion: love, passion, wanting to create something that’ll last,” says Jared Campbell, above, of the shed he built. (Chris Sorensen/For The Washington Post)

‘The Treehouse, Hold the Tree’

Jared Campbell, 38, used to travel every day to schools near his Upstate New York home to provide music instruction. When the pandemic required him to teach virtually, he poured his former commute hours into raising a shed as a playhouse for his kids. “We call it the treehouse, hold the tree,” he says. It also carries the affectionate nickname the Campbell Clubhouse. He too used the modern studio shed plans.

“I did everything all myself,” he says, with the exception of a “brute force older brother” who came to help lift the 500-pound front wall and hand up some roof pieces. “Every step of the way, and I mean every step, I had anxiety: ‘I don’t know how I’m going to do this.’ ”

[This gardener is quarantining in a haven he cultivated over three decades. He’s not complaining.]

Yet the challenge fortified his confidence. He says that his wife, Meridee, 40, pointed out another benefit to the shed’s construction, something he hadn’t realized: “Instead of sitting around wondering, ‘What am I going to do with my career and my life,’ this allowed me to have a little bit of an escape and not be bogged down,” he says. He had to sell several guitars for the treehouse fund but says the sacrifice was worth it. “If you don’t have a project like that, it’s easy to let thoughts come creeping in. Covid was such an unknown mystery as to how it would affect any aspect of your life — your health or your business. It’s enough to make you think all kinds of thoughts you wouldn’t normally think.”

Campbell had to sell several guitars to fund his “treehouse,” but he says the sacrifice was worth it amid the stress of the pandemic. “If you don’t have a project like that, it’s easy to let thoughts come creeping in.” (Chris Sorensen/For The Washington Post)

Once the shed was completed, Campbell took delight in “decking out the interior like an apartment” for his 8-year-old twins (a boy and a girl), 3-year-old daughter and — as of January 2021 — newborn boy. Before the shed shut down for the winter, the family watched movies on the pull-down projector screen while enjoying snacks and Capri Suns from the mini-fridge. As an homage to the treehouse concept, the shed’s artwork includes tree-trunk decals.

“The futon turns into a bed, so the kids have been begging to sleep in there once the weather cooperates,” says Campbell. “They’ve even talked about ordering pizza and having it delivered straight to the treehouse instead of the main house.”

“If I’d just built it for a lawn mower or tools, I wouldn’t have the same emotions,” he says. “I’d still feel proud, but because I made it for the kids, it adds a different level of emotion: love, passion, wanting to create something that’ll last.”

The Fancy Shed

Husband and wife Frank Donahue, 57, and Michelle Maskell, 42, of Preston, Conn., went all out on an elaborate shed that complements their house with arched windows, a cupola, a dormer and a steeply pitched roof. “I wanted to go high-end,” Donahue says. “It looks pretty cool.” Their 14-by-24-foot outpost follows Cockrell’s “shed with dormer” plans.

They had planned to go on a 10th anniversary cruise with 10 other couples in October, but when the pandemic arrived, they put that money toward building what they call “the barn” instead. Donahue has long wanted an antique red Chevy truck. Now, when it drives into his life, the shed — the equivalent of a four-car garage — will be the place to store it, along with the zero-turn mower and kayaks already housed there.

The couple has collaborated on many construction projects. “It does bring you closer, for sure,” says Maskell. “Because we come from military backgrounds, we have good work ethics and teamwork: ‘You grab one end, I’ll grab the other.’ ” And she was grateful for the diversion from the TV and its news. “We’re not the type to sit and fester about things like that. We choose a more positive way of distracting ourselves,” Maskell says.

Donahue had a hard time sourcing materials because of covid-19 and says the project ended up being more expensive than it would have been if they had waited a year. “But time’s more precious to me than money,” he says.

They were unable to purchase planned “hobbit doors,” but cuteness still reigns atop the cupola, in the form of a pig-shaped weather vane. “We wanted something adorable for the top and had different ideas,” says Maskell. “We both come from — I won’t say meager means, but we have modest beginnings — and we’ve done good, so the flying pig was that inspiration.”

The ADA-Compliant Shed

For Gordie Cumming, 53, the decision to build a shed stemmed from an unguarded moment with his psychotherapist wife, Liesl Farnsworth, 53, who was nervous about seeing patients in her office in downtown Bend, Ore. “We were worried things would get worse in fall and winter,” says Cumming. “I blurted out, ‘You know, I can build an office in our backyard,’ and she just said okay.”

[The great decluttering of 2020: The pandemic has inspired a clean-out of American homes]

Farnsworth is seeing patients only via telehealth at the moment, but they are thinking ahead to when the pandemic is over and clients arrive who may use a wheelchair or have other mobility issues. To allow for an office, therapy space and bathroom — all accessible according to the Americans With Disabilities Act — Cumming modified the popular modern studio shed plans, adding a lean-to roof.

To combat the steep slope on the site where he was building, Cumming had to dig down three feet and pour cement for concrete retaining walls and footings. On the downhill side, the shed rises a magnificent 18 feet, while uphill it is only 7 feet. Cumming adjusted the plans to build as large as he could without requiring a permit, added an 8-by-16-foot deck on the side, and served as his own electrician. For such a complex project, you’d think he would have previous experience, but he says the most complicated thing he had ever built was a doghouse when he was a kid. A friend reassured him that his inexperience would actually lead to a better build. “He said, ‘If you haven’t done something like this before, you’re going to do it really, really well because you’re going to be worried you’ll get it wrong.’ ”

“It’s been an emotionally satisfying experience because I’m learning I can do this stuff with some patience and some ‘oops’ along the way like everybody,” Cumming says. He relates how fun it was when someone thought he was just renovating a room in the house to create an office but then learned he was building an office. “The world’s got this crazy thing going on and we don’t know when there’ll be a return to normalcy,” he says. “No matter how long it takes, she’ll have a place that’s safe.”

The Pandemic Project

My family of four’s shed — created from Cockrell’s modern studio shed plans — also served as a calendar of days passing. Our younger child, 11, spent hours with my husband, Alan Howard, 51, fetching things and helping.

As an emergency room physician assistant during a pandemic, Alan treasured this collaborative, take-a-deep-breath time with her. “The majority of days, she was out there with me,” he says. “I’d bounce ideas off her and explain things to her so I could understand them myself. And as hard as I tried, I’m sure that she unfortunately learned a few new words.”

“I’m disappointed that it’s over; it gave a sense of daily purpose,” he adds. “There were no big questions, no unknowables, just a set of tasks. I’ll actually look longingly at the tools in the garage or the bag of nails and screws.”

While the shed was underway, we talked of how to situate a window-based air conditioner, but by the time it opened for business, we plugged in a space heater. That’s how California weather works: One day you’re sweating, the next you’re shivering. Time cycles on. Vaccines are invented. The children get older in discernible increments.

Someday I may sit in there when it’s become, as promised, my writer’s studio. I’ll probably look back at this time wishing I could worry about my husband’s virus-laden scrubs in the washing machine, or about the children overhearing my phone calls. I’ll wish for the pace of a lazy summer day with someone who is happy to sit in the sun and chatter away to her father on the ladder. And I know he will, too.

83,Dumbarton Oaks and the groundbreaking women who created it,"If I were to leave Washington, the place I would miss the most would be the garden at Dumbarton Oaks. To those of us who know and love this landscape gem in Georgetown, such a declaration may seem like a statement of the obvious. It is one of the great gardens of America, known by landscape designers and historians around the world, cherished by a protective cadre of neighbors, but generally not as well known as it deserves to be in the nation’s capital. The garden is open to the public, but Dumbarton Oaks is an academic research institute and has something of the forbidding ivory tower about it.

What do I like about the garden? Almost everything. The design, the trees, the garden rooms, the craftsmanship, the intellectual underpinnings and historical references, and the fact that the landscape is one of both variety and unity. If ever a garden was a work of art, this is it.

The hillside of massed forsythia is a blast from the past and the double herbaceous border slopes disagreeably, but otherwise the garden is, quite simply, a place that lifts you up and makes you feel good to be alive. The 16-acre ensemble is so refined that it transcends the period in which it was made, but we need to put aside this timeless quality for a moment and reflect on its origins and the two remarkable women — patron and designer — who created it a century ago.

The centennial is a moving target. Mildred Bliss and her husband, Robert Bliss, bought the estate in 1920; the designer, Beatrix Jones Farrand, first visited in 1921 but didn’t lay out her vision of the garden until 1922. It took the rest of that decade to reach the form we now recognize, and major additions to the house complex and some significant garden alterations occurred after the Blisses gave the property to Harvard University in 1940, and after Farrand bowed out.

When Farrand shared her concept in 1922, of garden spaces threaded between existing old trees, Bliss wrote back to say it made her “purr with contentment.” The language might suggest one dilettante in conversation with another, but both women defied such stereotypes. As the late landscape architect Diana Balmori said, the idea that Farrand “did gardens for rich ladies and designed them over tea” could not have been further from the truth.

[The vaunted garden at Dumbarton Oaks reopens after some major surgery]

By the time of the Georgetown commission, Farrand was a well-established landscape architect and had designed the first White House Rose Garden. She was the only woman among the 11 founding members of the American Society of Landscape Architects.

Other female garden designers of note came along soon after Farrand, but when she started, a woman was an oddity in the profession. Among the obstacles she faced was an 1897 profile in the New York Sun. “Miss Jones is 25 years old and comely. She is tall and slight, and her beauty is of the majestic kind that defies description.” The account, ostensibly of a woman who designed landscapes “from the ground up,” was unearthed by Farrand’s biographer, Jane Brown.

Brown notes in “Beatrix: The Gardening Life of Beatrix Jones Farrand” that at the time the newspaper was fixating on Farrand’s appearance, she was draining a 25-acre swamp, laying out a cemetery and clearing a 40-acre wooded plot into a sylvan landscape.

Farrand was born into privileged New York society. Her aunt was the novelist Edith Wharton, the family was close to that other chronicler of the Brahmin set, Henry James, and dinner guests included the society portraitist John Singer Sargent. Her parents split up when she was 10. For Beatrix, who never wore her heart on her sleeve, this moved her closer to her mother, Mary, and fed her determination to make it in a man’s world. The young Beatrix spent summers with her mother at Reef Point, their property in Bar Harbor, Maine, developing her knowledge of gardening and plants. More formally, she studied at Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum in Boston under the tutelage of its first director, a lion of American horticulture named Charles Sprague Sargent.

In 1895, when she was 23, Farrand and her mother undertook an extensive study tour of Europe, looking at historic and contemporary gardens in Italy, Germany, France and England. In more than six months of touring, Brown writes, Farrand “had amassed a large collection of photographs, made many rough sketches and notes, and these all contributed to her repository of design styles and ideas. From the Italian gardens in particular she had learned enduring lessons.”

Farrand and her mother returned to Europe frequently before World War I, mingling with the likes of Wharton, James and the expat owners of various Mediterranean gardens and villas. They resembled characters from a novel by Wharton or James or a painting by Sargent.

But if Farrand’s family was well connected, Mildred Barnes Bliss was well connected and rich. She was the heiress to a fortune built on patent medicine. She married Robert Bliss, a Harvard-educated career diplomat, in 1908. Their travels through South America — he was posted to Buenos Aires — stirred his interest in pre-Columbian art and artifacts. When they later moved to Paris, Mildred was drawn to collecting Byzantine art, guided by an expatriate aesthete and banker named Royall Tyler.

After World War I, they returned to Washington in search of a property where they could eventually retire and house their growing collections, and they settled on an estate known as the Oaks, a timeworn and much-altered Federal house set back from R Street NW, but with land that extended north to the far side of a stream valley, more than 50 acres in the city. It sloped steeply, especially on the east side of the house, and though the land was rustic and raw and dotted with outbuildings, it had many old trees and enormous potential.

[Ecological gardens are all the rage. But they also need to be pleasing to the eye.]

While the house was undergoing a wholesale refitting, Mildred Bliss needed to find a landscape designer for the garden. She knew of Farrand through Edith Wharton, whom Bliss met in Paris during the war. She may also have recalled that Farrand, years earlier, had worked on a garden for Bliss’s mother.

The new owners of the renamed Dumbarton Oaks wanted a country place in the city. Formal spaces for entertaining and for neoclassical allusions were always going to be a part of the landscape mix, but Farrand did not want “the dressed-up appearance so repellent in many modern gardens,” and Bliss agreed.

They decided that terraces should have a hierarchy of materials: brick in the upper levels near the house shifting to more rustic stone lower down. This gradation fed into the basic concept of the whole site as a landscape that is formal, then informal and finally pastoral.

The makers of great gardens tend to be either formidable horticulturists or exceptional architects of garden spaces. In England at this time, gardener Gertrude Jekyll and architect Edwin Lutyens were creating landscapes for the ages. Here, Farrand was Jekyll and Lutyens rolled into one. “I don’t think people appreciate how much [Farrand] had put together to do these incredible things,” says Judith Tankard, author of “Beatrix Farrand: Private Gardens, Public Landscapes.”

Walking through a cascade of terraces from the Orangery of the house to the amphitheater at Lovers’ Lane Pool, on the eastern boundary, you don’t feel you have descended 50 feet. There is no sense of gravity. “Her ability to tackle the slopes of that site is brilliant,” says Thaïsa Way, the institute’s director for garden and landscape studies. “That to me is the power of landscape architecture — engineered and comfortable but also designed so it’s beautiful.”

The garden’s fabric became a canvas of adornment, every element crafted for its space and role, including railings, gates, seats, plaques, urns and the rest. Bliss would have mock-ups made to see if they fit her vision. Hand-carved stone sculptures were first made in clay, then left wet and brought to their site so they could be adjusted as she desired.

Intimate garden spaces carried special historical and literary allusions. Around the fountain in the Arbor Terrace, inscriptions and sculptures honor both Dante’s “Divine Comedy” and an Italian friend and garden maker. The sweet little brick-and-turf amphitheater surrounding the Lovers’ Lane Pool is a nod to the outdoor theater of the Arcadian Academy of 18th-century Rome. The Star Garden is inspired by Chaucer’s translation of a Roman philosophical treatise.

The references are multilayered, and the garden itself is a synthesis of Italian, French and English styles. But it is not a pastiche; its own authentic character is molded by its complex response to its setting, climate, plant palette and the protean skies of the Mid-Atlantic. From the northern edges of the elevated terraces, the sky is an integral part of the vista.

Even as Robert Bliss retired in 1933, he and his wife were laying plans to give the property to Harvard, paving the way for the house, its library and subsequent galleries to become a place where scholars could study Byzantine and pre-Columbian art and landscape history.

[How to elevate a small, urban plot for maximum impact]

The transfer occurred in 1940. Mildred Bliss continued to shape the garden and additions to the institute until her death in 1969, but Farrand, who had plans to develop her own property in Bar Harbor as a place of landscape study, bid adieu to the garden in 1947. Some important changes to the garden were done by others, notably Farrand’s chief assistant Ruth Havey, who installed the showy baroque Pebble Garden where the tennis court used to be. Alden Hopkins replaced boxwood in the Ellipse with the iconic hornbeam hedge. But the Dumbarton Oaks garden is the magnus opus of one of America’s finest landscape architects and one that could only have been achieved with Mildred Bliss as her patron and design collaborator.

The partnership led directly to something more abstract but no less important: the role of Dumbarton Oaks as the incubator for the relatively new field of landscape history. A program for resident scholars has made the site a global center of study for decades, and an annual symposium and conferences have explored many themes, including the landscapes of war and the effects of botanical discoveries on society. A symposium in the early 1980s helped revive the reputation of Farrand, who was by then somewhat forgotten.

It is worth noting, surely, that one of the world’s greatest gardens was created by two women in an age when women were constrained by convention. “It’s not inconsequential that [Bliss] chose to do her most intimate project with another woman, and another woman who was established and had real authority,” says Way.

“Just as significant was the kind of ambition that the women shared, both for the garden and the institution,” says John Beardsley, former director for landscape studies at Dumbarton Oaks.

This field of study was formalized in the early 1970s but took root in the 1950s at a time when Bliss greatly expanded her collection of rare garden books and manuscripts. “Dumbarton Oaks really has been the cradle in this country of the field, a field which has now risen to be one of the more primary fields in art history,” the landscape historian Therese O’Malley said in a 2009 oral history interview for Dumbarton Oaks.

What were the women like? Farrand seems to have been always emotionally contained, cordial but not familiar. Her relationship with Mildred Bliss as a kindred spirit was closer than with other clients. Bliss called her “Trix,” and Farrand would sign off letters with “Yours very affectionately.” But even this bond weakened after Farrand retired. A gardener in Maine remembered her when she was about 80 strolling her garden daily, dressed in tweeds and using a walking stick but ramrod straight, like her walls.

Bliss was a more adventurous soul and served as the diplomat’s wife abroad (she later became the consummate Georgetown hostess), but she also was part of a circle of expatriate antiquarians. She came to Georgetown with the single-minded ambition to create her own 20th-century version of the Italian Renaissance villa as a shrine to the humanities. In her 80s she returned to her old haunts in Europe and the Middle East, and visited an archaeological dig in the deserts of Syria. She was a lifelong fitness fanatic and traveled with a suitcase just for her exercise weights.

In our fractured age, right-wingers would view Bliss and Farrand as East Coast elitists; those on the left would see them as figures of White privilege. I regard them as collaborating artists who gave to the world a keener understanding of the importance of gardens to civilization, and a beautiful refuge for visitors of all backgrounds.

Within these green spaces, there is a terrace or path or enclosure to give sanctuary to your joy, sorrow, pain, contemplation. “This garden means a lot to a lot of people in ways we don’t even realize,” said the former director of gardens and grounds, Gail Griffin, interviewed by Dumbarton Oaks. “I think it represents serenity.”

84,This flower power couple curates more than 300 acres of Washington’s downtown,"They call themselves “garden geeks”: Jim is “a tree guy,” he says. (His favorite is the white oak.) Cindy loves pink flowering plants the most. “But it’s like having children,” she says. “You really just love them all.”

Cindy grew up in Rockville, Md., where she spent hours in the garden, “growing flowers and vegetables just to see how they would look,” she says. After studying horticulture at the University of Maryland, she started at the National Gallery right out of college. Jim grew up in Philadelphia, helping his parents take care of their vegetable garden. He attended a public vocational-technical high school that specialized in agriculture, then graduated from Temple University with a degree in horticulture. They met when they both worked at the National Gallery, where they quietly dated until Cindy became the deputy chief of horticulture services — and Jim’s boss. “I told Jim he really needed to go,” she says, laughing. He shifted to the Architect of the Capitol, managing horticulture for the U.S. Botanic Garden before rising to his current position.

Although the couple haven’t worked together formally for nearly two decades, they still speak the same plant language and lean on each other for advice when problems arise. “Cindy has some hideaways up on the East Building [of the art museum],” says Jim. “She’ll take pictures in the morning every once in a while and send them to me. ... I don’t get that vantage point, so it’s like the sun coming in from the Capitol — it reflects all these beautiful pink colors.” (“Or I can be mean and take pictures and say, ‘Boy, you really need to work on your grass!’ ” Cindy says.)

Cindy’s pre-pandemic life meant arriving at the office at 6 a.m. and “walking five miles every day, visiting the campus and directing the wide variety of areas we support from the Sculpture Garden — the greenhouses, the garden courts, terraces and every exhibit and interior space,” she says. Now, like for many of us, her work is done mostly over Zoom. The National Gallery closed and reopened a few times over the past year; each time, Cindy had to be ready, constantly “planning for normal.” The museum’s March anniversary is celebrated annually with a rotating display of 250 azaleas in the Rotunda, and Cindy and her staff spent the winter preparing the plants to transfer from greenhouses in Frederick, Md., but the museum didn’t reopen after all. (The Sculpture Garden reopened in February.)

For Jim, the pandemic and the Jan. 6 siege on the Capitol — which was followed by the erecting of non-scalable fencing — meant some pivoting, too. He and his team continue to care for more than 4,500 trees and all the flowering plants on 274 acres of Capitol landscape. (His department was not in charge of the fencing.) Like Cindy, Jim’s days this past year have been less hands-on, which he misses. “Nothing ever replaces the ability or the experience to walk the grounds, feel the landscape and talk to people,” he says.

But the pandemic has allowed the Kaufmanns to spend more time in their own garden in Silver Spring, Md. Last summer, tending it was their “pandemic therapy,” says Cindy. It reflects their different horticultural styles, and over the years, the yard has naturally divided into “Cindy” and “Jim” sections. “Jim is very much into a very naturalistic garden,” says Cindy. “I’m a little bit more on the crazy floral side of things ... as colorful and as many flowers as I can possibly have.”",0
85,Date Lab: ‘What an honor to be a part of this date with her’,"Neither Alyse nor her date, 32-year-old Lissa Piercy, a director of corporate projects and an instructor at a local gym, had been on any covid-necessitated virtual dates. Call it beginner’s luck or Date Lab magic: The Zoom date was “a great one,” according to Alyse, and it went on for about four hours. Over the course of that time, Alyse gave Lissa a virtual tour of her apartment, Lissa’s friend who was staying with her made a cameo, and a legitimate connection seemed to form quite naturally. It certainly didn’t hurt that there was immediate mutual physical attraction.

“Popping on Zoom, I was so taken. She’s very beautiful. What an honor to be a part of this date with her,” recalled Alyse. Lissa reported: “My immediate reaction was that she was super cute and I loved her glasses.” Lissa said that Alyse broke the ice by acknowledging the strangeness of sharing a meal (an order from the Dabney for Alyse, sushi for Lissa) and conversation on screen that would then be shared widely with Washington Post readers. With that out of the way, they settled into a wide-ranging discussion that touched on diversity in the media, something that Lissa is especially passionate about (previously, she managed activist poets).

“Just to be able to have that conversation felt really comfortable,” said Lissa of their exchange about representation on television. “That was a thread throughout the whole date: We kind of both spoke that same language.”

Indeed, because Lissa had been raised Episcopalian and was quite involved in the church during her youth, there wasn’t the typical learning curve to surmount when Alyse discussed her job. She routinely has to explain to those unfamiliar with her inclusive Christian denomination how she can work as a priest being a gay woman. Lissa said that Alyse prefaced her job description with, “Okay, this is kind of weird,” which Lissa interpreted as a sign of empathy. “It’s like acknowledging the weirdness the other person might feel ahead of time so that it can create a more comfortable space.”

“I don’t see it as a burden,” said Alyse of having to explain her calling to the women she dates, who sometimes have negative associations with less welcoming religious denominations. “It’s another form of coming out. It’s just another piece of who I am.”

Lissa underwent her own coming out of sorts when she told Alyse of her bipolar diagnosis and two manic episodes, “in which I hallucinated and fully lost touch with reality.”

“It was good to talk about that,” said Lissa, who is open about her diagnosis in part to help destigmatize mental illness. “I knew that she would [understand] because she’s a priest. I had no fear.”

“In a world that doesn’t usually accept mental illness as something simply a part of a person’s life, it was wonderful to talk with someone who loves herself, bipolar and all,” Alyse said.

The two also indulged in a bit of fantasizing about their potential future together. Lissa is a big fan of “The Bachelor”; Alyse is not but agreed to watch an episode with her sometime. Alyse loves to grocery shop and cook, while Lissa is more inclined to clean up the kitchen after the meal is done, suggesting complementary sensibilities.

Still, that part of the discussion remained hypothetical. “When we would mention future things [it] was very much in a way of, ‘Oh that could work,’ but no assumption that definitely will happen,” said Lissa.

Sounds like a spark, right? Yes and no, said Alyse, who was eager to meet in person (at a social distance) to figure out whether they could be a match. Lissa was similarly interested, though after a breakup in June she resolved to remain single for a year and plans on sticking to that, leaving the door open for something initially casual.

Firmly entrenched in what might be a burgeoning relationship, they agreed to get together mere days after their Zoom date. Alyse said: “We left it with: ‘Let’s meet up and see where the rest of this pandemic life takes us.’ ”

Rate the date

Alyse: 5 [out of 5]. “[During the date she] said, ‘It’s a 5! This is a 5 experience.’ I said, ‘The feeling is mutual.’ ”

86,Southern Poverty Law Center President: ‘We have to get back to a place where we all can agree on how to find truth’,"So we actually have seen cycles of hate. Typically, the number of hate groups grow during Democratic administrations. And then they typically are quieter during Republican administrations, which is just one of the observations my colleagues have made over time. We did see an increase in the number of active hate groups during Obama’s tenure as president — and new groups forming and white nationalism growing.

Story continues below advertisement

Then something unusual happened with Trump’s election. These groups didn’t actually calm down and get quieter. They actually got even bigger and more active. And so we have seen record numbers of hate groups and hate activity over the last four years — I think, no surprise to anyone, clearly encouraged and supported by the president himself in the ways that he called out both-siderism. You know, “good people on all sides” of conflicts between white nationalists and Black Lives Matter protesters. We also saw him, during the presidential debates, calling out to the Proud Boys. So he has spurred all of them to feel that they are much more part of the mainstream now. And not only mainstream in the political process but mainstream in the development of policies that these groups have long advocated [for], like building a wall, like turning people away from the border.

Advertisement

So we’re at a really strange moment because those groups have really encouraged and collaborated with and engaged in the false claim that [Trump] actually won the election. And that has actually spurred even more collaboration between folks who support President Trump and the Republican Party but may not be members of white nationalist groups, and then the white nationalist groups and other extremist groups. So there’s a high level of engagement in that that we just really hadn’t seen before. And it’s not clear where we go from here.

It is clear that President Biden and his administration are taking a really strong position against this, and we’re fully anticipating a number of efforts to really step up ways to counter these groups and to try to prosecute those who are turning to violence. But in the meantime, it’s also clear that we have a number of groups who have already used violence very publicly to achieve goals and who may very well continue to pursue those goals at the state level, at a local level, as well as at the federal level.

Story continues below advertisement

But fortunately, it’s not hidden. There’s so many times the Southern Poverty Law Center was trying to raise attention to something, and people weren’t really paying attention; that’s not the case now. A lot of people are paying attention, which is great. But it doesn’t mean that everyone has figured out how best to [counter hate] or even which groups to go after. So we’re having a lot of conversations with different parts of the federal government and some state governments about the need to take more precautions, to share more information and to coordinate efforts so that it’s not just responding to one-off events, but really learning from how these groups operate and how they’re coordinating efforts across the country.

What are the best ways that you’ve seen to counter hate?

Advertisement

Well, there’s a few things. One issue is de-platforming. I know there’s been a lot of public debate about whether that was a good thing to de-platform President Trump [on social media]. And I would argue that it absolutely is. You have to de-platform people who are using platforms to incite violence and spread misinformation in ways that are actually really harming our democracy. So we’re going to need to see more efforts by the technology companies to monitor their platforms to ensure that there is not disinformation being spread, that there is not planning for violent activities happening. They have not demonstrated a willingness to do that until very recently, and it’s going to have to step up. So that’s one way.

Another way is absolutely to investigate and prosecute those who are responsible for violence. While January 6th was shocking and terrifying for so many people, it’s not the first time that armed white nationalists have shown up in capital buildings and threatened lawmakers. And yet, we didn’t see the kinds of investigation and prosecution of those groups in the way I hope we’re starting to see now. So that points to a real shift in the way that security agencies and intelligence agencies have been considering the domestic threat. And then there’s a last part, and that’s just for all of us. We’ve all been surrounded for the last several years by a swirl of misinformation that’s widely shared. And we have to get back to a place where we all can agree on how to find truth, which is not easy after years of disinformation. That means that we have to correct things when they’re incorrect. We have to share resources that are reliable. We have to encourage our families and friends and others to challenge some of the things they’re being told and to really look at other resources to see if they’re supporting those truths. Those are things that every one of us can do — and not just wait for government or leaders to take steps.

Looking back at the rise in hate-related violence in recent years — during the Trump administration and the insurrection at the Capitol, attacks across the country on Asian Americans in recent weeks and months — how do you make sense of where we are in the year 2021?

Advertisement

I don’t think there’s been a time in history when we haven’t had racism and people who always seek to feel better by pulling somebody else down. That’s just a part of some human nature that encourages people to win by making others lose. There will always be problems. But we can shift the direction we’re going in, and we really need that reset right now.

In a country where there’s such mass division, how do we do that?

Story continues below advertisement

Well, this gets back to misinformation. We don’t have the same understanding of history in our country. There are probably half of the people in the country who would tell you a very different story about the last four years than my story. And when we don’t come from a shared understanding of history, we don’t have the same solutions or proposals for where we need to go.

So how do we reset so that we can all start from that [shared understanding]? Some of it is making sure that the perspectives on history that are so often overlooked in this country really get documented and clearly seen as much as the traditional white version of history. It’s not going to solve the problem; there will always be these other challenges of human nature. But agreeing on a shared history together is always one of the first steps to then figuring out how we make the future better. That’s why the civil rights struggle saw a lot of steps forward, because they actually persuaded the entire country that the history was bad and that collectively we had to change it. So we need another moment like that where we can demonstrate the harm that’s been done in ways that everybody can see and acknowledge so we can move forward.

And what’s your level of optimism around whether that can happen? And in what time frame, and to what extent?

Story continues below advertisement

Well, it’s never a four-year political cycle. That’s for sure. It is a longer stretch. But I think we’re already on the cycle of bringing back that different perspective on our history and really encouraging a much broader community of people in this country about what’s needed to change. We saw that last summer when the protests erupted over George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery and all of the other victims. We saw people across the country acknowledging, Yeah, there is something really, really wrong. It’s not just the targeted community of young Black men and women, but the whole country acknowledging it. And that starts a shift. And so now — with a new administration and with hopefully a more awakened population — we have the chance to build on that.",0

So, that is what you are thinking. But you are wrong, since, by my calculation, confirmed by sources as august as Facebook, birthdays are a huge deal. When it is your birthday, all 7,500 of your closest friends get reminded digitally that it is your birthday, and, in a gigantic and generous and coordinated expenditure of four seconds of their time, they wish you a happy birthday. You feel validated.

I hereby apologize to Cecilia, who is a real person, and an actual puppeteer, and who does not obnoxiously observe her birthday in an ostentatious display of self-celebration the way most of the rest of you do. For the purposes of this column, she is simply a tool, an innocent vessel through whom I am expressing utter disdain for people who consider their birthdays sacrosanct, worthy of applause, simply (rhyme alert) ... because. I recently had occasion to confront these people. It was on Twitter. I explained that I felt celebrating birthdays was a ridiculous thing to do, and that I had heard of friendships destroyed by people not remembering other people’s birthdays, and — I am saying this again, for emphasis — that everyone has a birthday. Yours, for example, is Oct. 2. I have at least a one in 365 chance of getting it right, and you will be so happy.

The results of the Twitter escapade sort of astounded me. People were outraged. One guy accused me of being un-American and evil, denying people the God-given right of feeling proud on the day they have officially lived another year. This man was not alone. There were dozens more. One informed me that I am the Grinch, only worse; that I seek to sap joy from all humans and bring disrepute on everyone’s ancestors. I was flattered. I am second to none in my admiration for the Grinch.

Because you are a smart person, you are likely wondering what I think of childhood birthday parties. I am fine with them. Children are wonderful innocent creatures who have little reason, in their lives, to celebrate their accomplishments, except for such things as successfully pooping in a toilet. I do not begrudge them the birthday conceit, except that they have to understand it has to end. I propose the age of 9. I think every child’s ninth birthday should be declared the Birthday Repudiation Day. The kid gets a lot of presents, and they will be big, like a piano or an actual spaceship, but that will be it for the remainder of his or her life. It’s the day you understand your birthday means squat. If you are Jewish, this will be a more important day than your bar or bat mitzvah.

My birthday, by the way, happens to be Oct. 2, like yours. It is one of the most common birthdays, because — this is true — it biologically coincides with people having sex on New Year’s Eve. So, to me, it is a celebration of my parents that I refuse to think about and DEFINITELY don’t celebrate.

88,Ada's on the River restaurant review: A Potomac view meets polished cooking,"Story continues below advertisement

Dinner can begin with a wedge salad — or a foie gras doughnut. Entrees include 75-day aged New York strip, but also ricotta gnocchi infused with the smoke of a live fire.

Ada’s on the River is the 10th, and largest, dining establishment from Alexandria Restaurant Partners, whose brands include the Majestic, Mia’s Italian Kitchen and Vola’s Dockside Grill. Weighing in with nearly 300 seats, patio included, Ada’s is named not for one of the principal’s cherished relations, but for the respected 19th-century English mathematician Ada Lovelace. “We love to name restaurants after women,” says Dave Nicholas, managing partner for the company. The name also acknowledges Northern Virginia’s role as a tech center. Lovelace is regarded as one of the first computer programmers; close readers might catch the lines of code woven into the newcomer’s menu.

Matthews figures 90 percent of his work touches some part of his grill before it leaves his open kitchen — salads included. The singed ruffles on the gem lettuce are thanks to their pass over burning apple wood and mesquite in a mesh wire pan. The bread is black because it’s made with active charcoal; a small loaf comes with butter lightened with orange zest. (Fear not: The charcoal affects the color of the brioche, not its flavor.)

Doughnuts for dinner? Matthews makes a good case for the showy appetizer, which starts with a brioche doughnut gilded with smoked honey and crushed almonds. On top teeters a warm slice of foie gras. Circling the doughnut is sour cherry compote. In the hands of a lesser chef, the combination might be a food joke. Here, the tender cushion, delicate crunch, livery flourish and tart fruit make some magic in the mouth.

The beef at Ada’s is all prime and dry-aged, a process that imbues the steaks with a subtle mineral tang. The signature cut is the underutilized but flavorful tri-tip — the bottom of the top sirloin — which Matthews rubs with powders (mustard, onion and garlic) and spices (cumin and smoked paprika) before cooking sous-vide and finishing on the grill. In another mouthwatering touch, the steaks benefit from a brush with beef fat before diners slice in.

Lamb is easy to fall for as well. You could begin a meal with lamb carpaccio, shot through with harissa and cooled with celery leaves, and move onto rack of lamb, slathered with chimichurri.

You may have come for meat, but Ada’s lavishes just as much attention on seafood and vegetables. It’s personal. “I’m a pescatarian,” says the chef, who is also a partner in the business. His best salad highlights shaved Brussels sprouts and crisp apple, although a spear of the fork also brings up sharp blue cheese, roasted grapes, bitter endive and toasted pecans, every bite better for its bright green goddess dressing. There are oceans of octopi out there. The chef’s slowly braised tentacles, charred to order, rise to the top with a zesty chorizo-spiced oil and fried chickpeas. A server’s description of the lump crab cake “cooked in a cylinder to keep its shape” and wreathed in creamed leeks and pickled shallots compels us to order the tall beauty, which is basically crab sandwiched between crushed saltines that form a brown crust as the dish cooks in a cast-iron pan.

The chef is a good editor of his work. He seems to know what to add where, and in just the right amount. Familiar dishes distinguish themselves with nice pops of flavor. Consider that crab cake. A rémoulade sparked with preserved lemon keeps its richness in check.

Knowing that Matthews’s favorite way to end a shift at St. Anselm was with a bowl of spinach suggests you should order the side dish at Ada’s, where a lot of the uncut green is mixed with not too much Mornay sauce and Parmesan, meaning the spinach retains its texture and taste.

Matthews’s pillowy herbed gnocchi are draped in a brick-colored sauce, bright with tomatoes, that’s a ringer for a meaty ragu but in fact relies on crumbled vegan “sausage.” The pasta is set in embers in a firebox next to the grill, adding an overlay of smoke to the entree. (I appreciated the dish as much the next day, rewarmed in a fancy gold-and-black takeout carton, as I did the evening before, on china that looks like a throwback to Ada Lovelace’s era.)

I’m still trying to dine outside restaurants. But brief visits to Ada’s host stand, just to check in, hint at what I can look forward to when we can return indoors: sleek jewel-toned seating, 18-foot ceilings and an exhibition kitchen set off with red tile. The place crackles with energy, and from more than where meat meets heat on the grill.

Nicholas says he aimed for service incorporating aspects of fine dining but “without the pretension.” My notes regarding the staff at Ada’s are sprinkled with exclamation points and smiley faces. “I have a question,” says a diner. “I have an answer!” enthuses a server. Everyone seems well versed in the menu, if not always in who gets what dish. But you know what? I’m so pleased to be eating outside here, a mistake or two isn’t going to keep me from saluting the service. Besides, talking to live attendants is a nice change of pace from running into a restaurant to retrieve a bag of food.

Ada’s chocolate souffle takes 20 minutes to prepare. Use the time to admire the company’s expansion plans. Alexandria Restaurant Partners is doubling down on efforts to attract customers to the waterfront with Barca, a spacious Mediterranean-themed wine bar serving small plates, which was poised to launch at the end of March. The attraction, fashioned from two shipping containers, sits on its own pier, directly over the Potomac in front of Ada’s. The view takes in National Harbor in Maryland and its Ferris wheel, toy-size from where you’re eating.

The wait for the souffle concludes with a reward. Made with Valrhona chocolate, the intense confection becomes richer at the table when a server pokes a hole in its center and fills it with caramel sauce. Different but just as impressive is the lemon tart, a round of sunshine contrasted with blueberry compote and a cloud of Chantilly cream. The pop in the picture: peppercorns in a comet of blueberry sauce on the plate.

And remember the foie gras doughnuts. As a server pitched us, “people who’ve ordered them before tend to order them the next time for dessert.”

89,Airlines ground some 737 Max jets after Boeing discloses electrical problem,"Southwest Airlines said it was pulling 30 of its 58 Max planes from service, while American Airlines said it would ground 17 of its 41 planes. United Airlines is pulling 16 of its 30 Max planes and Alaska Airlines will ground all four in its fleet. It wasn’t clear Friday how many jets worldwide were affected.

Story continues below advertisement

The new problem surfaced as airlines have returned the Max to the skies after a pair of deadly crashes killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019, leading to the jets being grounded worldwide for almost two years. On Friday, American operators again were left to ensure the public that the planes were safe.

Boeing said it would work with customers to help them with fixes, but it’s not clear how long that might take.

The FAA said in a statement that Boeing alerted it to the problem late Thursday.

The agency cleared the Max to fly again in November, ordering safety fixes to address design flaws that contributed to the crashes. American Airlines became the first operator in the United States to return the jet to its fleet in late December.

Story continues below advertisement

American said in a statement Friday that only the planes it received after the Max was returned to service were affected.

“As we shared when we returned the 737 MAX to commercial service, the safety of our customers and team members comes above all else,” American said. “It’s with this unequivocal standard that we rigorously maintain and monitor all our aircraft — including the Boeing 737 MAX — to ensure every plane in the air is safe.”

United said in a statement it is working with Boeing to determine when the planes could return to its fleet, but said it had no estimate of a timeline.

“We have been in touch with the FAA and Boeing and will continue to work closely with them to determine any additional steps that are needed to ensure these aircraft meet our rigorous safety standards and can return to service,” United said.

Story continues below advertisement

Southwest said it had not experienced operational problems with the planes and was only using the Max in a limited capacity, with up to 15 of the planes scheduled to fly each day.

“Southwest anticipates minimal disruption to our operation, and we appreciate the understanding of our Customers and Employees as Safety is always the uncompromising priority at Southwest Airlines,” the airline said in a statement.

Boeing said the new electrical issue is unrelated to a new software system that was singled out after the crashes or to a separate wiring design problem.

“The recommendation [to ground flights] is being made to allow for verification that a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system,” Boeing said in a statement.

Story continues below advertisement

Appearing at a White House briefing Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said officials need full confidence in the safety of the grounded aircraft before they return to the air.

The latest problem is a blow for Boeing at a time when it appeared to be recovering, securing new Max orders as airlines prepared for a rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. In late March, Southwest — which only flies 737s — agreed to order 100 more of the jets, putting to rest speculation that it might opt for an Airbus plane to expand its fleet.

The new disclosure follows other allegations of manufacturing and quality problems with the plane, including congressional testimony in 2019 by a former Boeing manager that he repeatedly warned company executives about production problems at the Max plant in Washington, calling it a “factory in chaos.”

Earlier production lapses have led the FAA to take action against Boeing.

In January 2020, the FAA said it was proposing a $5.4 million fine against the company, accusing it of saying that defective wing parts for 178 Maxes were safe to use. The agency had previously proposed a $3.9 million fine in connection with the same alleged issue on older generation 737s. The cases remain open, the FAA said.

In August, the FAA accused Boeing managers at a South Carolina plant that makes 787s of pressuring safety inspectors to rush their work. The company agreed to pay $6.6 million to resolve that case and other allegations that it didn’t to live up to a settlement designed to improve its safety culture.

The deadly crashes, in Indonesia and Ethiopia, led to a temporary halt to the production line while Boeing and the FAA worked to approve safety fixes for the planes. The design of the software implicated in the crashes, called the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, was overhauled and pilots were required to receive new training.",0

92,Inside the U.S. government’s new $30 million effort to combat pandemic profiteering,"Identity thieves are lying to trick you into giving up your personal financial information, which they will then use to steal from credit card companies by pretending to be you.

Scams have become so sophisticated and ubiquitous that it’s hard to know whether the calls, texts and emails are fake. Technology allows hucksters with distant landlines — and now mobile phones — to display local numbers in an effort to trick you to answer.

Story continues below advertisement

Now, factor in the pandemic and the massive effort to get people vaccinated.

The scams are coming fast and furious, relentlessly conning people at a time when they are vulnerable.

Billions of dollars in stimulus payments are being sent to Americans, and that makes them a target for fraudsters. Coronavirus-related cons have given crooks another way into people’s bank accounts, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, whom President Biden name acting chair of the Federal Trade Commission, said in an interview with The Washington Post.

“People are desperate,” Slaughter said. “They are struggling financially. They’re worried about their health. They’re dealing with child-care issues. And that’s why it’s great that the money is coming, but bad guys are seeing that desperation, too, and are taking advantage of it as they do. We’re just looking out for people who are trying to take advantage of that stimulus money and other related programs.”

The FTC received nearly 2.2 million consumer fraud reports last year, up almost 27 percent from the year before, including a surge of online shopping complaints in the early days of the pandemic. Consumers reported losing more than $3.3 billion to fraud, up from $1.8 billion a year earlier.

Last year, the FTC introduced ReportFraud.ftc.gov, an updated platform for consumers to file fraud complaints.

The FTC is seeing scams involving personal protective equipment (PPE). The agency has also pursued schemes involving the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides money to businesses to help them make payroll during the pandemic.

In the interview, Slaughter discussed the role the FTC is playing in chasing down and prosecuting pandemic profiteers.

Tucked in the third round of stimulus aid, largely unnoticed, was $30.4 million allocated to the FTC to fight not just the old consumer scams but also new schemes with a pandemic twist.

Under the American Rescue Plan, signed by Biden on March 11, $24 million went to fund full-time employees at the FTC to address unfair or deceptive acts or practices, including those related to the coronavirus. An additional $4.4 million would go to process and monitor consumer complaints received by the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network, including increased complaints about schemes related to the pandemic, and $2 million for consumer-related education to help consumers avoid coronavirus scams.

Here is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation about why this money is so important — and why more is probably needed.

Q: What type of covid-related scams are you seeing?

A: There are lots of pandemic profiteering challenges that we have, whether it’s scams related to PPE or vaccines or fake cures or economic business opportunities. People are promising desperate folks easy money that it turns out you have to pay a lot of money upfront to access this great new business opportunity. These are things that we see generally, even in normal times, but it’s accelerated and amplified by the economic desperation around covid-19.

Story continues below advertisement

We are particularly seeing economic scams. We sued a company that targeted struggling small businesses and induced them to submit loan applications by falsely claiming to be an approved lender for the Small Business Administration when they were not. We’ve sued a business for deceiving customers by sending mailers that featured a seal of the United States and a mock stimulus check and promised to get people federal stimulus benefits but actually just lured them to a used-car sale.

Q: Are there covid scams specifically targeting minorities?

A: Business-opportunity scams where companies target consumers with fake earnings claims. We sued a company that targeted Latino customers with false earning claims in Spanish-language ads. I think that these kinds of scams that particularly target communities of color are especially pernicious because they are doubling down on the disparities that we’re seeing across the board in health outcomes and economic fallout and basically everything associated with the pandemic.

Q: How do you get ahead of these scams?

A: It’s a two-step process. The first thing we have to do is educate consumers about what to look out for. And we do that in partnership with state and local authorities and in partnership with community advocacy groups. And we just launched a new Community Advocate Center that will help us reach communities that might not otherwise have the FTC immediately on their radar. Consumer education is a huge part of it. We don’t want people to fall victim to scams in the first place.

Story continues below advertisement

And then we do actually go after the scammers whenever we find them. We collect complaints and we pursue law enforcement action in coordination with state and local partners. We do that because there are many targets. It is hard to get all of them. But when we bring cases, we send a strong message that we are not going to tolerate predatory, deceptive, unfair behavior targeting communities of color or any other communities.

Q: Why is it important for people to report covid scams to the FTC?",0
93,We tested the first state ’vaccine passport.’ Here’s what to expect.,"Regardless of where you live, vaccine passports on the horizon promise to fast-track our safe return to public spaces. But only if people are able to access and trust them. And that’s a big if.

With the help of New Yorkers across a range of ages, I’ve been testing Excelsior Pass to see whether digital vaccine passports create more problems than they solve. Using Excelsior Pass is entirely voluntary, but it requires learning about the state’s system and mastering a few different websites and apps. It took me 20 minutes over Zoom to help an octogenarian set up his pass, though it was certainly simpler than mastering vaccine-appointment websites. Even when we thought we understood the system, Excelsior Pass didn’t always work: My tech-reporter colleague tried to use it to enter Yankee Stadium, but the system didn’t update with his clearance until after the game was over.

Story continues below advertisement

The good news: For the digitally savvy people who figure it out, using Excelsior Pass doesn’t appear to pose major privacy risks. The system, designed for the state by IBM, cannot be easily used by the state to track you. And it’s more discreet than the alternative of showing your medical records to a bouncer.

But I question how effective Excelsior Pass will be at keeping everyone safe. For one, it’s pretty easy to set up a fake pass. (Yikes, you might want to take down any vaccine selfies you posted to social media.) To stop potential fraud, you always have to show your ID along with Excelsior Pass — which is another kind of barrier that could make some people not want to use it.

As other states and even private companies work on their own vaccine passports, some of New York’s other choices also deserve scrutiny. The state hasn’t been very clear about where, and for how long, we might be required to show a vaccine passport — digital or physical. We all expect to need a passport at a border crossing, but will we eventually need a vaccine passport at Starbucks? The grocery store? Work? I found you could technically already use Excelsior Pass to scan your own dinner party guests … if they’d still call you a friend after.

At Madison Square Garden, which used Excelsior Pass for three games last week, most people still aren’t using the app — but it’s doing the job of being quick. “While the numbers are still small, they’ve nearly doubled at every game, which we expect will continue as more people become familiar with the app,” spokeswoman Kim Kearns says. “From a technology standpoint, everything has been straightforward, and worked well.”

As goes New York, so goes the nation? Here’s what we can all learn from the early days of Excelsior Pass.

Proof of vaccination to travel or attend school is not new, but the coronavirus has introduced a potential need to modernize outdated paper standards. (Jonathan Baran/The Washington Post)

How it works

Just the idea of vaccine passports is controversial — Florida’s governor issued an executive order banning them — so it’s important to be clear about how New York is and isn’t using Excelsior Pass. The state’s guidelines require theaters, major stadiums and arenas, wedding receptions and catered events to screen customers for the coronavirus. Businesses can do that by confirming either your vaccination status or that you’ve had a coronavirus test in the past 72 hours.

When you show up at one of these businesses, you can bring your physical vaccination card from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or a copy of a recent test result — or flash the Excelsior Pass that replaces both of those. The high-tech approach is voluntary, but providing proof of your coronavirus status to these kinds of businesses is not.

Setting up an Excelsior Pass requires a few steps. You start at the state’s website and enter your name, date of birth and Zip code. It follows up with a few questions about when, where and how you got the vaccine or a test. Then it pops up a QR code — a special kind of bar code — that contains your name, date of birth and whether you’re cleared for either reason.

Story continues below advertisement

You could print out your Excelsior Pass from the website, save a picture to your camera roll or add it to an app on your phone. To do the latter, you download the NYS Wallet app for Android or iPhone. The app will ask you to scan the QR code you generated on the Excelsior Pass website, and it pops up instantly.

Once you get your code, you should be set. But we experienced glitches getting to that point. My colleague Gerrit De Vynck wasn’t able to use Excelsior Pass with his rapid test results before Monday’s Yankees game. Turns out, the private test provider he chose was slow to upload results to the state database. He was still able to get into the game by showing a printout of his results.

New York says people looking for a quick turnaround should get a test from a list of providers that have committed to rapid reporting — but I’m not sure how we were supposed to know that.

Story continues below advertisement

For a lot of people, using Excelsior Pass is going to require trusting how it handles our privacy. It’s complicated, but New York put in some smart protections: No health information gets stored on your phone — just that QR code with your clearance status, your name and birth date. The state and IBM both say they aren’t getting any new data about you when you use Excelsior Pass. (New York already has an exhaustive database of everyone who’s gotten the vaccine or a test.)

The app does ask for access to your camera roll, to read a QR code you might have stored there when you first registered. But it doesn’t appear to collect location or other identifying information that could be used to track you.

The same applies to the separate app that businesses use to read your Excelsior Pass, called NYS Scanner. The app deletes your personal information after each scan. That means, in theory, using Excelsior Pass doesn’t leave an extra trail of personal data that could be tracked by police, immigration authorities or businesses.

The best arguments for using Excelsior Pass are that you’re less likely to accidentally misplace an important record on a little piece of paper — and you’re more likely to move quickly through line.

A balancing act

Testing Excelsior Pass, what surprised me most was how easy it is to fake.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

When you first sign up for your QR code on the state website, it asks a handful of questions based on your vaccination and testing records. But after that, you’re on the honor system — you can add the QR code to any phone without any more challenge questions.

That’s far less secure than the smartphone tech millions of Americans now use to securely pay for things using Apple Pay and Google Pay. Those credit card systems require you to unlock with your face, fingerprint or passcode right before you make a payment. Why didn’t New York use Apple’s iPhone Health app, which includes more robust security protections?

Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the nonprofit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project, told me he was able to load up a volunteer’s Excelsior Pass in about 11 minutes, using nothing more than that person’s Twitter posts and information from publicly available websites. Posting a photo of your CDC vaccination card puts it all out there.

Story continues below advertisement

Vaccine passports could leave us exposed to the “worst of both worlds,” says Cahn — a complicated digital system that puts up new barriers to access businesses, while not actually stopping fraudsters. “Despite its invasiveness, Excelsior Pass won’t advance the underlying public health goals it claims to support,” he says.

It isn’t clear how wide a problem vaccine passport fraud could become, or how dangerous it would be. Passports could persuade people to let down their guard about masks and other protections. Madison Square Garden, for one, says it wasn’t aware of any cases of people trying to enter the venue with an Excelsior Pass that wasn’t their own.

“To be clear, Excelsior Pass is a voluntary system that creates a digital copy of a preexisting paper record — it is not a standalone identification document,” said Kristin Devoe, a spokeswoman for Empire State Development, the umbrella organization that created Excelsior Pass. To fight fraud, New York says venues accepting Excelsior Pass are supposed to check people’s photo IDs.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

But instituting new ID checks at businesses that didn’t used to require them creates new social barriers. One of my senior citizen testers told me he was too old to have a driver’s license.

New York says it tried to make Excelsior Pass more accessible by including an option to just print it out from the website — no smartphone required. But that assumes people have a printer, too.

“You need to have a translator before you can really understand the nuances of this technology,” says Noel Hidalgo, executive director of BetaNYC, a civic tech nonprofit organization. “To get the vaccine, you had to have high-speed Internet access and have time and literacy. In many ways, the Excelsior Pass is an extension of that.”

Story continues below advertisement

I fear vaccine passports could become something akin to the TSA PreCheck security lines at airports: A system that works to speed up life for the savvy or wealthy, yet literally leaves everyone else in the slow lane.

Advertisement

Cyd Harrell, a design consultant and author of “A Civic Technologist’s Practice Guide,” says more important than making a vaccine passport 100 percent fraud-proof is understanding when using it actually makes us safer, and where we already have sufficient public health protections in place. That way we can make the right choices about balancing security with access.

“How much of life is it going to exclude you from if you can’t provide the smartphone-enabled proof?” says Harrell. “And how long is this going to be in place?”

We need answers to those questions before we start bringing vaccine passports beyond stadiums to more critical parts of American life.",0
94,The revolution in satellite technology means there are swarms of spacecraft no bigger than a loaf of bread in orbit,"The images of the glaciers in 2016 came from a constellation of satellites no bigger than a shoe box, in orbit 280 miles up. Operated by San Francisco-based company Planet, the satellites, called Doves, weigh just over 10 pounds each and fly in “flocks” that today include 175 satellites. If one fails, the company replaces it, and as better batteries, solar arrays and cameras become available, the company updates its satellites the way Apple unveils a new iPhone.

Story continues below advertisement

The revolution in technology that transformed personal computing, put smart speakers in homes and gave rise to the age of artificial intelligence and machine learning is also transforming space. While rockets and human exploration get most of the attention, a quiet and often overlooked transformation has taken place in the way satellites are manufactured and operated. The result is an explosion of data and imagery from orbit.

Just as computers have shrunk from room-size behemoths to an iPhone that can fit in your pocket, satellites, too, have shrunk dramatically. Instead of being the size of a garbage truck, costing as much as $400 million, satellites now are often no larger than a microwave or even a loaf of bread. They cost a fraction of their predecessors, as little as a $1 million or less, and can be mass produced in factories, or in some cases a garage or college classroom.

As the size and costs of satellites have come down, their numbers have grown dramatically. The number of satellites in operation more than doubled from 1,381 in 2015 to some 3,371 by the end of last year, according to Bryce Space and Technology, a consulting firm that tracks the industry. In 2011, there were only 39 satellites launched that weighed less than 1,322 pounds, or 600 kg, according to Bryce. By 2017, that was 338, and by last year, as SpaceX began putting up hundreds of its Starlink satellites designed to beam the Internet to rural areas, the number leaped to more than 1,200.

The industry is poised to continue its rapid growth as SpaceX and others put up constellations of thousands of satellites intended to serve areas without access to broadband. The incredibly shrinking satellite has given rise to less expensive rockets designed specifically to launch batches of small satellites. And competition among the launchers continues to drive down the cost of delivering a spacecraft to orbit.

Now the industry has caught the attention of venture capitalists, who have been funding companies like Planet and others. In recent weeks, two satellite companies, Spire Global and Black Sky, have gone public through a merger known as a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.

Companies around the globe are working to develop small satellites. AAC Clyde Space, a Sweden-based company, has launched 10 satellites, some known as “cubesats,” for their small four-inch dimensions that weigh just a few pounds.

Like Planet, it offers “space as a service,” meaning people can buy access to the data from their satellites without worrying about launching or building the spacecraft themselves.

Story continues below advertisement

“You don’t have to get engaged in how to design the satellites, follow the production, take care of the testing,” said Rolf Hallencreutz, chairman of the company’s board. “You tell someone, ‘I need this kind of data.’ And we provide that data. For us, it changes the game because it allows us to serve multiple customers with the same constellation.”

The small satellite industry has also caught the attention of the Pentagon and intelligence agencies that would love to have swarms of small satellites, able to launch quickly and easily replaced, peering down behind enemy lines.

Planet was founded in 2010 by a trio of young scientists and engineers who were working at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley in what has become a classic tech start-up story: Young guys, driven by idealism, working late on their own time and harnessing their best nerdy tendencies to build their own satellites that were smaller and cheaper.

Story continues below advertisement

Yes, they did it in a garage in Cupertino, where Apple is headquartered. Since then, Planet has successfully launched 452 satellites and become the vanguard of the industry.

Now, it has more than 500 employees, and its total active users has grown an average of 40 percent per year since 2018.

The company’s satellites circle the globe in carefully designed orbits that “line-scan the Earth” — taking precise photographs of landmasses that together create an image of the planet every day. That gives scientists and researchers a look at conditions on the ground, so they can track changes to forests, coastal areas, shipping traffic and farmland in near real-time.

The images can help with border security, tracking refugees and disaster relief. Since the company has compiled a vast archive of images, stretching back years, its subscribers can visit the past, observing how it has changed — a searchable time lapse of the Earth.

“The pictures don’t lie,” said Will Marshall, co-founder and chief executive of Planet.

Andreas Kääb, a glaciologist at the University of Oslo, discovered that as he was exploring what caused the devastating avalanche in Tibet. He and other scientists noticed “that the neighboring glacier seemed also to behave strangely,” he said in an email. They tried to reach local authorities in Tibet, going through contacts in China, to warn them that it was also about to collapse. But it took about a day before their message got through. By then, “the glacier had already collapsed,” he said.

Nobody was hurt, but the “case shows that high-resolution daily images are very important in disaster management, and they clearly have the potential for rapid early warnings.”

The Amazon Conservation Association, a nonprofit, uses the satellite imagery to monitor illegal logging and gold mines in the Andean Amazon. In the past, it used traditional government satellites that took pictures “every eight days, and if it’s cloudy, you have to wait another eight days,” said Matt Finer, director of the Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project.

Those images had 30-meter resolution, which was decent but not great when you are trying to count trees. Then the European Space Agency launched a satellite with improved resolution, showing objects 10 meters across. But Planet’s satellites were a welcomed improvement, three-meter resolution and images that are available daily.

“This is real-time monitoring on the scale of hours or days,” Finer said. “A lot of times, we’re looking at an image of today or yesterday.”

The government data was free, and the group had to pay a subscription fee for Planet’s images. But it was well worth it, Finer said. “You’re talking about leaps of improvement in your visual and analytical ability,” he said.

And using some of Planet’s next-generation satellites, which provide even higher resolutions, “we can see individual trees. We can see logging camps,” he said. Even the blue tarps that miners put up as makeshift roofs to protect from the rain and sun can be seen.

Given the high costs of satellites, traditional operators often rely on proven technology they know is reliable but may not be the most up-to-date, Marshall said.

“We’ve taken a different risk approach,” he said. “You’ve got more satellites coming in, and if a few of them fail, no big deal. That is what enables us to take the latest technology … and iterate fast.”

Small satellites are less expensive, to launch — leading to a new model of small rockets designed to be less expensive and launch on demand. Rocket Lab, which launches out of New Zealand and soon out of the Eastern Shore of Virginia, is the leader in this relatively new market.

Later this year, it plans to launch a satellite the size of a microwave to the moon. The satellite would fly in the same orbit around the moon that NASA expects to use for the space station called Gateway it intends to operate there.

Other rocket companies are entering fast, including Virgin Orbit, the start-up founded by Richard Branson.

Instead of launching its rocket vertically from a pad, the company tethers its boosters to the wing of a 747 airplane that carries it 40,000 feet or so. The rocket is dropped, then fires its engines and is off.

That gives the company the ability to launch nearly anywhere there is a runway — and that is of interest not just to scientists and conservationists who want to get satellites up quickly, but to the Pentagon and intelligence agencies as well.

After Virgin Orbit’s first successful launch in January, Gen. Jay Raymond, the Space Force’s chief of space operations, congratulated the company on Twitter. And Will Roper, then the Air Force’s top acquisition and technology official, tweeted that the capability “is a big disruptor — and hopefully a deterrent — for future space conflicts. The satellite equivalent of keep an ace up your sleeve … err, plane.”

Satellites already provide missile warning, GPS, communications and reconnaissance and guide precision munitions. But the smaller and more capable they become, the more the Pentagon is interested in using them.

“These small satellites are now mission critical,” said Dan Hart, the chief executive of Virgin Orbit.

Another key benefit is that if one malfunctions, or is taken down by an adversary, “we can very quickly put another one up, and we can do it from anywhere on Earth,” he said. Using a 747 as a launcher, the Pentagon could also do it surreptitiously.

Much of the increase of satellites in orbit has been driven by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which has launched more than 1,000 of its Starlink satellites in the past year or so. The company intends to put up a constellation of thousands more, each weighing about 550 pounds, that would beam the Internet to remote and rural places on the ground that are not served by broadband.

Late last year, SpaceX received $886 million from the Federal Communications Commission as part of an effort to help bring Internet service to underserved communities. The awards would bring “welcome news to millions of unconnected rural Americans who for too long have been on the wrong side of the digital divide,” then-FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said at the time.

Several other companies have similar plans.

OneWeb, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, has more than 100 satellites in orbit and plans to launch hundreds more. It says it can build a satellite in a day instead of the weeks or months it takes for larger spacecraft. And they cost about $1 million each, compared with the $150 million to $400 million for a larger satellites that live in more distant orbits, and are able to endure for years.

Amazon plans to launch a constellation it calls Kuiper that would put up some 3,200 satellites. It has until 2026 launch half of those to keep its approval from the FCC.

But it does not take millions of dollars to make and launch a satellite anymore.

The Education Department is sponsoring a competition among high schools across the country to build cubesat prototypes. It recently announced five finalists whose proposed small-satellite projects would determine whether homeless encampments in California are in high-risk wildfire areas, study the different ways urban and rural areas absorb heat, and determine how a North Carolina town’s population growth affects “air quality, land use and temperature.”

At the University of Michigan, Professor Brian Gilchrist’s engineering class worked to build a small satellite that would test using the Earth’s magnetic field for propulsion. If successful, it would have allowed small satellites to orbit Earth without having to carry fuel, allowing them to stay aloft for longer periods of time. It was a novel project for the class. “None of the students involved in this project had ever built a spacecraft before,” Gilchrist said.

The cost was about $500,000 to $600,000, paid in part by the university and NASA. Parts came from industrial mail order suppliers, including a few from Amazon, Gilchrist said.",0
95,A recruiter joined Facebook to help it meet its diversity targets. He says its hiring practices hurt people of color.,"Eight months later, in August 2020, Lindsey attended a virtual meeting to discuss the company’s goal of hiring more Black engineers. In the meeting, a White manager played a Drake song in the background whose chorus repeats the phrase “Where the [n-word]s be at?"" five times, according to videos of the incident reviewed by The Washington Post.

Lindsey asked in the chat system why they were playing the song, then said he was “really disappointed,” according to the video. Nine other employees who were present in the meeting echoed his frustrations by putting emoji expressing shock alongside his comment.

“It shows you the insensitivity and the lack of awareness,” Lindsey said. A manager subsequently apologized, according to the video.

The country was in the midst of a historic reckoning over racial justice, and Facebook had just set an ambitious hiring goal of 30 percent more people of color in leadership by 2025.

But Lindsey and other current and former Black employees involved in hiring — as well as potential recruits who filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission last summer — describe a problematic system that makes it difficult to achieve that and other diversity goals. They say the company has adopted metrics that prompt recruiters to go through the motions without actually delivering talent. Even the diverse candidates who are brought in can be rejected over vague concepts such as “cultural fit.” They also say that the problem goes deeper than hiring and that many employees of color feel alienated by the social network’s culture.

Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said the company is focused on advancing racial justice in the workplace and in recruiting. “We’ve added diversity and inclusion goals to senior leaders’ performance reviews. We take seriously allegations of discrimination and have robust policies and processes in place for employees to report concerns, including concerns about microaggressions and policy violations,” he said. He did not address the incident involving the Drake song.

Lindsey quit the company in November, just 11 months after he started, and has since founded a start-up.

Facebook is facing a federal investigation launched last summer by the EEOC into allegations of bias in hiring, promotion and pay, according to the complaint. The EEOC has since expanded the case into a systemic probe, a special designation that means the agency is examining whether company practices may be contributing to widespread discrimination and is assessing the potential to bring a broader lawsuit representing an entire class of workers, according to the lawyers representing the complainants.

The EEOC declined to comment. The agency can speak publicly about allegations only if they result in a lawsuit against the employer.

In the EEOC complaint, three Black job applicants say they met all the advertised job qualifications but were rejected after going through the interview process. They say they were told by Facebook interviewers that the company was looking for people who would fit in culturally. One candidate, whose lawyer requested The Post withhold her name because parts of the complaint are not public, said she was told by a Facebook hiring manager, “There’s no doubt you can do the job, but we’re really looking for a culture fit,” but was not given any further explanation.

“Culture fit” is an ill-defined term for whether a candidate is a good match for a company’s internal culture.

A Facebook operations manager who is identified in the complaint, Oscar Veneszee Jr., who is Black and still works at Facebook, said in an interview that he submitted more than half a dozen qualified applicants who were underrepresented minorities for jobs at Facebook but that all were rejected. He said he suspected it was because they failed the cultural-fit test.

Story continues below advertisement

“When I was interviewing at Facebook, the thing I was told constantly was that I needed to be a culture fit, and when I tried to recruit people, I knew I needed to find people who were a culture fit,” he said. “But, unfortunately, not many people I knew could pass that challenge because the culture here does not reflect the culture of Black people.”

Facebook’s Stone said the company’s recruiters do not assess cultural fit. Rather, he said, the company looks to see whether skills and behaviors exhibited in the interview process — such as responses to questions about what a person might do in a particular scenario — align with Facebook’s values.

“There is no culture-fit check mark on an application form, but at Facebook it is like this invisible cloud that hangs over candidates of color,” said Lindsey. He added that at least a dozen qualified candidates of color that he referred for interviews were also rejected by Facebook, with culture fit part of those decisions. “It really boils down to: Who do I feel comfortable hanging out with?”

Racial issues at Facebook have been particularly acute over the last year because of CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s decision to give wide latitude to racially divisive comments by President Donald Trump during last summer’s protests, and because of the company’s role in providing a platform for extremist groups that espouse white-supremacist ideas. The decision to leave up Trump’s comments was of particular concern to workers of color, some of whom met personally with senior leaders to protest the decision; others have left the company. Facebook software engineer Ashok Chandwaney quit publicly in the fall, citing unease with the social media giant’s role in fueling hate.

Zuckerberg’s decision “created such lack of psychological safety on all kinds of levels, and Black employees in particular didn’t know how to truly process that,” said a former Black executive who cited the decision as one of her reasons for resigning.

Facebook is one of several Silicon Valley companies, including Google and Microsoft, to announce ambitious diversity targets in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man killed while in police custody in Minneapolis. But years of tech companies’ annual diversity reports show only incremental progress on increasing the ratio of Black and Latino employees, as well as high attrition rates among Black women, supported by recent accounts of racial bias and inequities in pay and promotion from Black women at Google, Pinterest and Amazon.

Story continues below advertisement

Google’s leadership is more than 95 percent White or Asian and 73 percent male, and Facebook’s is more than 87 percent White or Asian and 66 percent male, according to the companies’ 2020 diversity reports.

The independent civil rights auditors that Facebook hired to scrutinize its record last summer found attrition was of concern to employees of color and to civil rights advocates, and noted a “disconnect” between the experiences described by employees of color and the company’s myriad diversity and inclusion initiatives. In the report, which was made public by Facebook, auditors also called the company’s permissive stance on politicians’ speech a “tremendous setback” for its civil rights progress, saying such decisions were made by members of senior leadership who lacked civil rights expertise.

The auditors noted that “civil rights leaders have characterized the current numbers for Hispanic and African American staff as abysmal across every category.“

Currently, just over 85 percent of its workforce is White or Asian, and more than 90 percent of those in highly compensated technical roles are White or Asian, according to its annual diversity report. That is down from 91 percent of the overall workforce and 94 percent of the technical workforce in 2014, when the company first published its annual diversity report.

Story continues below advertisement

Women make up 37 percent of all roles, up from 31 percent in 2014. And they now fill 24 percent of technical roles, up from 15 percent in 2014.

Many tech workers and civil rights advocates say progress on diversity often is thwarted by invisible biases and outright discrimination that permeate Silicon Valley culture, leading to fewer hires, unwelcoming environments and high attrition among workers of color.

Ifeoma Ozoma, a former public policy official at Facebook, said that when she was asked to interview job candidates at the social media giant, the process was superficial and numbers-driven. In one instance, she alleged, a Facebook recruiter told her there were already sufficient numbers of women in the running for a particular role, implying there was no need to find additional applicants from underrepresented groups.

Story continues below advertisement

Ozoma added that none of the recruiting measures matter if retention isn’t a focus. ""Even the best managers are not always able to protect their hires from toxic work environments,” she said.

When Lindsey started sourcing candidates for Facebook, he said, he and other recruiters used a custom-built software dashboard called FBR, or Facebook Recruiting platform, where recruiters recorded their outreach to candidates and created profiles for them. Their manager had weekly meetings with them to gauge their progress.

If recruiters didn’t hit targets of making contact or starting the recruiting process with a specific number of people of each race and gender each week, they were told specifically that executives, namely Zuckerberg, were unhappy with them, Lindsey said. Managers would then enforce 30- to 90-day “lockdowns,” a long-standing company-wide practice in which employees are told to drop all other responsibilities to make progress on a single metric, such as a requirement to increase the number of Latino candidates a recruiter pinged on LinkedIn. Sometimes the recruiters were able to hit the targets, but it’s not clear how well it worked, he said.

Managers primarily instructed recruiters to infer the race and gender of candidates by scouring the Internet, particularly Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, he said.

They then formalized those guesses and inputted them into a system that any person who interviewed the candidate could see, according to Lindsey and to a screenshot of the system viewed by The Post. The screenshot showed nine affirmative action, or AA, categories with a bubble next to each for check marks that would become part of a candidate’s profile. Seven of the categories were race-based, including Black and Hispanic, and two were for women and veterans. He said the system was still being used when he left.

The pressure sometimes led recruiters to make problematic assumptions, Lindsey said, based on his conversations with other employees, discussions at their team meetings and his own experience.

Tech recruiters say it’s a common, if unspoken, practice in Silicon Valley to guess the race and gender of applicants. It’s a less-than-ideal outcome of companies trying to reduce the risk of violating civil rights laws, which effectively prevent employers from requiring candidates to disclose their race outright.

Another former Black Facebook recruiter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is bound by a nondisclosure agreement, confirmed that FBR contained race tags when he worked there in 2018. He said that in his department, which was different from Lindsey’s, both team leaders and other recruiters told him not to use them. He was told they were being phased out because that type of guesswork was frowned upon. His team also no longer used culture fit as a hiring criterion, he said.

Julie Levinson Werner, a partner at the law firm Lowenstein Sandler, said that because both state and federal law prohibit making hiring decisions based on a protected characteristic, companies avoid asking to try to mitigate their risk of a lawsuit.

But many recruiters don’t put their guesses in writing or, if they risk doing so, might note them in code — such as emoji — in their applicant-tracking software, said diversity expert Nicole Sanchez, founder and CEO of Vaya Consulting. She advises clients against this kind of guesswork.

Lindsey’s description of that practice within Facebook was troubling, Sanchez said, because it took that guesswork to another level by potentially exposing it to everyone involved in the hiring process.

Stone said the company does not instruct recruiters to visually inspect the race of prospective candidates and instead asks them to use objective criteria, such as membership in a professional society for a certain ethnicity or whether a person went to a historically black school.

According to Lindsey, the pressure sometimes resulted in recruiters feeling the need to duplicate candidate profiles — manipulating the profile slightly so the same candidate would count twice, or tagging White candidates as people of color — in the tracking system to inflate their numbers. He said he never did so.

Facebook’s Stone declined to comment on Lindsey’s allegation.

That system then fed into an interview and selection process that was not inclusive, Lindsey said. The educational backgrounds of candidates of color, who more frequently came from less prestigious universities, coding boot camps or HBCUs, were often dubbed less of a cultural fit in human resources meetings, Lindsey said.

Lindsey says his time at Facebook led him to co-found his start-up, Siimee, which helps job candidates connect with recruiters on an app that focuses on prioritizing inclusivity and mitigating bias. It lets people create profiles where they can openly discuss their identities and ambitions and share those with potential employers.

He says a lot of people are surprised that he left such a prestigious company.",0
96,Employee benefits in the post-pandemic workplace,"In-office meals and game rooms will hold less appeal for those who prefer working from home. Home-office stipends may not entice those who miss the hum and camaraderie of a busy office full of other adults. And employers aren’t going to want to throw away more money on benefits that made sense only when long commutes and face time were the default, however popular those benefits may still be.

Take, for example, the employer mentioned in a previous column that stopped offering employees a public transit subsidy after shifting to an all-remote model during the pandemic. “Companies tend to be tougher when it’s a subsidy because it’s their money,” says David Judd, a transportation consultant in Watchung, N.J. The employer might also have been concerned about adhering to IRS rules on ensuring that tax-free commuter benefits are being used for appropriate business purposes.

But the employer in this case will probably have to replace that benefit with an alternative transit perk. Judd noted that New York is one of several U.S. cities where employers are required by local ordinance to offer some kind of pretax commuter benefit to employees. The employer, said Judd, could comply with the New York ordinance by letting employees fund their own transit benefits with pretax payroll deductions, keeping the employer’s costs down while giving employees a break on their work expenses.

Looking ahead, even though transit perks may not be much in demand now, Judd notes that reinstating or enhancing existing transit perks would be a “great incentive to get people to come back to the office.""

Speaking of perks and incentives, other readers weighed in on how their employers have adapted their offerings to meet changing needs during the pandemic:

Perks my employer added because of the pandemic:

1. Monthly mental health days (whole company closes for the day)

2. $200 for additional expenses needed for a remote office

New benefits negotiated by my union include four hours of paid leave per shot to get vaccinated and a clear policy that paid sick leave can be used liberally for covid-related matters. Management also made it easier to file expense reports for office supplies purchased while working remotely. — Kurt Vorndran, Washington, D.C.

97,Rip currents kill more people than tornadoes. NOAA is launching a model to predict them.,"Rip currents are strong, localized and narrow currents that extend from a beach out beyond the surf zone. They are often mistakenly called an undertow, but that term is erroneous — rip currents do not exert a downward force, but rather one away from shore.

Swimmers caught in rip currents are often carried away from the beach at speeds too swift to fight against. Some beaches suspend swimming when rip currents are particularly active, but they can develop without warning and be tough to spot.

More than 80 percent of all lifeguard rescues in the U.S. stem from swimmers caught in rip currents.

If caught in a rip current, the best response is to ride it beyond the surf zone and then swim parallel to the beach to escape its pull — but for inexperienced swimmers, the combination of panic and lack of awareness often proves fatal.

In many cases, swimmers attempt to swim against the current, exhausting themselves and draining their ability to survive.

In October 2019, well-respected NOAA scientist Bill Lapenta died after drowning in rough seas at a North Carolina beach. The National Weather Service had been warning of an increased threat of rip currents associated with the offshore passage of Hurricane Lorenzo. His death hit the agency hard.

Story continues below advertisement

Since then, NOAA has doubled down on efforts to educate the public about the dangers of rip currents, but only recently announced the launch of its new model.

Advertisement

Greg Dusek, a senior scientist at NOAA’s National Ocean Service, created the model himself, which was born from a research project he undertook while a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2007. At the time, he was working with lifeguards on the Outer Banks to collect data that would be integrated into his model.

“When I finished school and started at NOAA a few years ago, we started the process to get it operational,” he said. Part of that meant waiting for technology to catch up.

“We didn’t have the modeling capability to provide the input we needed,” he said.

Story continues below advertisement

The new rip current model ingests data from NOAA’s Nearshore Wave Prediction System, an ocean forecasting model that was upgraded in January. That upgrade made it possible to apply Dusek’s methods.

“We’re now providing an hourly forecast, and since rip currents are influenced by the tides, we capture that variability,” Dusek said. “If the likelihood [of rip currents] is going to change throughout the day, we can tell you that. We’re able to provide about a kilometer resolution along shore.”

That means two neighboring beaches would receive different, custom forecasts. Before, the National Weather Service issued blanket forecasts that could span 100 miles or more.

To improve the model’s accuracy further, NOAA partnered with the United States Lifesaving Association, a nonprofit group representing lifeguards, to collect observations of rip currents and learn more about them.

Story continues below advertisement

Dusek explained that the improvements in the models will equip beachgoers to make more informed decisions.

“When people are planning weekends at the beach or lifeguards are planning staffing … they’ll use this,” he said.

The next hurdle is figuring out how to disseminate the enhanced forecasts provided by this model to the people who need them. The Weather Service currently issues beach hazard or high rip current risk statements one or two days in advance. With the ability to pinpoint rip current risks six days out, the Weather Service is evaluating how to design products that will raise awareness of the impending hazard.",0

Its discovery, she added, “will give us a rare glimpse into the life of the ancient Egyptians” at a time when the empire was at its wealthiest.

The lost city is the latest in a series of archaeological discoveries unearthed in recent months across the country that are bringing fresh understanding of the dynasties that ruled ancient Egypt. Egypt’s government hopes that such findings will bolster the nation’s all-important tourism industry, battered in recent years by the coronavirus pandemic, Islamist militant attacks and political instability.

Aten promises to be among the most significant of the recent finds. But it remains to be seen whether it will capture the world’s imagination as Tutankhamen’s golden mask and other artifacts have done for decades since his tomb was discovered in Luxor’s Valley of the Kings in 1922.

Egyptologists applauded the discovery on social media Thursday, calling it “extraordinary” and a valuable source of information to better understand Egypt’s past civilizations.

“Settlement archaeology is extremely valuable for learning true historical facts and broaden our understanding of how the ancient Egyptians lived,” tweeted Paola Cartagena, a graduate student at the University of Manchester studying Egyptology.

Archaeologists started excavating in September in the area between the temples of King Ramses III and Amenhotep III. The original goal of the mission was to find King Tutankhamen’s mortuary temple, said the statement.

“Within weeks, to the team’s great surprise, formations of mud bricks began to appear in all directions,” said the statement. “What they unearthed was the site of a large city in a good condition of preservation, with almost complete walls, and with rooms filled with tools of daily life.”

“The archaeological layers have [lain] untouched for thousands of years, left by the ancient residents as if it were yesterday,” it said.

“Many foreign missions searched for this city and never found it,” Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist and former minister of state for antiquities affairs who led the mission, said in the statement.

The city was active during the reign of Amenhotep III, as well as during his co-regency with his son, Amenhotep IV, also known as Akhenaten, the father of Tutankhamen. The city was later used by Tutankhamen and his successor, King Ay.

Hawass said the city’s streets are flanked by houses, some of which have walls nearly 10 feet high.

The archaeological team dated the settlement through hieroglyphic inscriptions found on wine vessels, as well as rings, scarabs, pottery and mud bricks bearing the seals of King Amenhotep III’s cartouche, the statement said.

So far, several enclaves of the city have been uncovered. In the southern part, the archaeologists found a bakery and a large kitchen complete with ovens and pottery to store food, said the statement. They also found an administrative and residential district fenced in by a zigzag wall with only one entrance, suggesting it was to provide security, said the statement.

In a third area was a workshop. The team also found casting molds to produce amulets and ornaments, apparently for temples and tombs, according to the statement.

“All over the excavated areas, the mission has found many tools used in some sort of industrial activity like spinning and weaving,” the statement said, adding that metal and glassmaking slag has also been found.

In other parts of the city, the graves of two cows or bulls were found in a room. And in another area were the remains of a person, found with arms outstretched to his side and a rope wrapped around his knees. The team is investigating both cases to glean more information about social practices during that era, the statement said.

A large cemetery was found to the north of the city, as well as a group of tombs cut from rock.",0
99,Tourists and looters descend on Bears Ears as Biden mulls protections,"A renowned wilderness guide with decades of experience exploring the Bears Ears area, Hadenfeldt has long argued that this austere landscape teeming with archaeological and cultural treasure in southeastern Utah should be viewed as an outdoor museum. And each time he visits, more of that treasure has been looted.

“Come on, people,” he muttered in disgust, as he scanned the sandy soil this week for pieces of painted pottery from the Ancestral Puebloan Indians that used to be so easy to find in this area.

“This whole site was covered with beautiful pot shards,” he said. “I guess we’re just never going to stop people from pocketing this stuff.”

In the three years since President Donald Trump slashed the size of the Bears Ears National Monument by 85 percent, undoing protections established by President Barack Obama, the pressures on this area have only intensified, according to the residents and scientists who study it. The threats come in many forms — from roaring ATVs to uranium mining to coronavirus-weary tourists seeking outdoor adventure — on land that is considered sacred ground by several Native American tribes.

On her first trip as the new interior secretary, Deb Haaland arrived in this small town perched under bluffs and spires Wednesday for three days of meetings and hikes in the area. The first Native American Cabinet secretary in U.S. history is reviewing what to do with the Bears Ears National Monument and the nearby Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument that Trump also reduced in size. After her visit, Haaland is widely expected to recommend that President Biden restore the Bears Ears boundaries to at least the 1.35 million acres established by Obama near the end of his term in 2016.

On Thursday, Haaland hiked with Utah Republicans including Sen. Mitt Romney and Gov. Spencer Cox, as well as tribal leaders, to see Native American settlements in an area known as Butler Wash. She planned to meet with mining and drilling executives and business leaders from the recreation industry, as well as proponents of the national monument.

“I know that decisions about public lands are incredibly impactful to the people who live nearby. But not just to us, not just the folks who are here today, but people for generations to come,” Haaland told reporters during a news conference in the city of Blanding. “It’s our obligation to make sure that we protect lands for future generations so they can have the same experiences that the governor and I experienced today.”

“This place is filled with cultural heritage,” Haaland said. “That cultural heritage belongs to every single American.”

Biden’s allies see Bears Ears as an early opportunity to prioritize conservation over fossil fuel extraction on public lands while responding to an issue of particular importance for Native Americans, who want to see the monument not only restored but expanded beyond the Obama boundaries.

Without protection, the remains of thousands of Native American settlements and cultural sites are in “grave jeopardy,” said Pat Gonzales-Rodgers, executive director of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which is composed of five tribes with deep ties to the region.

“At the end of the day, these are the sanctuaries and the cathedrals of worship and cultural practice for these tribes,” he said.

But Bears Ears remains a divisive issue in Utah. Republican politicians do not want Biden to use an executive order to restore the monument. Instead, lawmakers say they can build a more durable solution through federal legislation that would allow for negotiations among ranchers, miners, Native Americans and conservationists to balance competing interests.

Story continues below advertisement

“If President Biden rolls this out, the likelihood that it will be rescinded by a future president or taken up by the Supreme Court is just extremely high,” said Rep. John Curtis (R-Utah), whose district includes Bears Ears. “And that’s a terrible way to resolve these issues. Nobody wins.”

Cox, Romney and other Republicans stressed the need for legislation that could reach a more permanent compromise for how to use land around Bears Ears.

“The minute we made them a monument, people started coming,” Cox told reporters. “The more people who come, the more degradation that happens to the lands. And how do we celebrate these areas and not love them to death, and not overwhelm them?”

Story continues below advertisement

“All of those things can only be done through legislation. They can’t be done through an executive order,” he said.

Curtis has asked Haaland to delay the monument decision “just long enough to see if we can reach this consensus.”

“How in the world does somebody in Washington, D.C., know where you should be able to hunt and fish, where you should be able to gather wood, where grazing is appropriate?” he added. “Let’s leave those decisions to the locals.”

Controversy draws crowds

Because Bears Ears was challenged by Trump so soon after it was created, much of the infrastructure that can be found at other protected areas — signs, buildings, management staff — does not exist here. But the crowds came anyway — fueled by social media and the national spotlight on the area.

“Visitation has just really skyrocketed,” said Josh Ewing, executive director of Friends of Cedar Mesa, a nonprofit that seeks to protect the area. “You’ve got all this visitation happening without resources.”

More than 420,000 people are estimated to have visited Bears Ears last year, despite the pandemic, and Ewing expects well over half a million visitors this year. Volunteers have seen visitors leave trash, loot fossils and remnants of Native American settlements, and scribble graffiti over ancient rock art. Car campers and RVs can be spotted parked on the rims of canyons and driving through the area, following GPS coordinates posted on the Internet that identify archaeological sites.

“Google is really managing the monument,” said Tim Peterson of the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group.

One recent tourist rush targeted the spot where an intriguing 10-foot public art “monolith” was found in a canyon last year, at a site that was within the monument boundaries established by Obama and excluded by Trump.

“It was completely overrun,” Peterson said. “It’s a textbook example of how completely out of control things can get.”

The Bureau of Land Management, which oversees what remains of the Bears Ears National Monument and other public land, has just two law enforcement officers in its Monticello field office who are responsible for nearly 2 million acres, according to Friends of Cedar Mesa.

Faced with the shortage of government resources, Friends of Cedar Mesa volunteers opened a Bears Ears visitor center in 2018 to try to orient tourists. The group even resorted to installing portable toilets in one area particularly popular with hikers.

“We’re paying for those to be pumped and maintained out of nonprofit dollars just to address the human waste issues that are in that area,” Ewing said.

Native American tribes and environmentalists sued Trump over his decision to shrink the monument, arguing that national monuments are permanent and Trump didn’t have the authority to revoke Obama’s decision. That case is now on hold pending the Biden administration’s review.

The five tribes that came together in a historic coalition to fight for the monument more than a decade ago — the Navajo Nation, Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Hopi Tribe, Ute Indian Tribe and Pueblo of Zuni — are calling on the Biden administration to create a 1.9-million-acre monument, as they had originally requested of Obama, said Matt Campbell, a lawyer representing three of the tribes in the lawsuit against Trump.

“If we saw something that was identical to President Obama’s plan, the tribes would be grateful, but there would be some disappointment,” he said.

‘Big blanket of red tape’

Less than a year after Trump sliced 1.1 million acres out of the Bears Ears monument, Kyle Kimmerle, a residential contractor from Moab, filed a claim with the Bureau of Land Management to dig for minerals on land that had been within the protected zone established by Obama.

Uranium mining is both part of his family history — traced back to his great-grandfather — and a hobby for Kimmerle. He called his mine Easy Peasy.

“Some people go fishing on Saturday, I go tinker around on my mining claims,” he said.

Trump had been lobbied by a Canadian mining firm before reducing the size of Bears Ears, and an ongoing concern among critics has been that mining or oil and gas companies would rush into the area once protections were removed.

Not much of that has happened so far. There have been six mining claims filed since 2018, according to the Bureau of Land Management. Environmentalists who track the area say that the Easy Peasy mine is the only one that has been actively excavated.

Kimmerle dug up 30 tons of ore, sampled it for vanadium and identified uranium — a feasibility study, he called it. At the moment, with uranium prices about half what they’d need to be for him to break even, he said, mining here is not feasible.

“Nothing is going right now; the price is just too low,” he said.

Environmentalists point out that prices could always change and that without protections, the land remains at risk.

Kimmerle said a restored Bears Ears monument would make Easy Peasy hard — if not impossible.

“There is layer after layer after layer of red tape and regulation in this country,” he said. “And that monument will be one more big blanket of red tape.”

Scientific work stays buried

Trump’s decision to slash the monument already cost Robert Gay some work.

The paleontologist who studies fossils of crocodile ancestors around Bears Ears watched as federal research dollars dried up after Trump shrank the monument.

He had planned to be in Bears Ears this week, digging up what he called a “really amazing site” full of fossils of phytosaurs — a predatory crocodile mimic with a blowhole above its eyes — that all appeared to die off simultaneously in one mass event.

After discovering the site in 2016, Gay had received a $25,000 grant from the National Conservation Lands Scientific Studies Support Program, money Congress sets aside for scientific work on national conservation lands, including national monuments. He had started excavating, but once his site fell outside of the national monument boundaries, he said, he could no longer access the funding.

It is “probably one of the most interesting fossil sites from this time period in Utah,” said Gay, who is land programs director at the Colorado Canyons Association. “Because there’s no money, it’s going to not be excavated again this year.”

In his fieldwork, Gay has found ATV and motorcycle tracks crossing the fossil sites he is working on.

100,Rise of coronavirus variants will define the next phase of the pandemic in the U.S.,"The bottom line on all three remains positive. In laboratory tests, vaccines are just as effective against the variant identified in the United Kingdom as they are against the original strain of the virus. And there is only a modest drop-off in their effectiveness against two others.

“These variants emerged because we continued to give the virus more chance to spread,” said David D. Ho, whose lab at Columbia University is leading the research on the P.1 variant first discovered in Brazil. “The sooner we vaccinate everyone, the faster we will contain the viral spread and reduce the chance for new variants to emerge.”

But the overall picture hides problems in some places. One or more of the variants — which also cause more severe disease than the original version of the virus — are racing through the Northeast and the Midwest. That has prompted officials in some communities to ask for more vaccine than they would receive under the government’s population-based formula. Officials in the Northwest are watching a major outbreak of the P.1 variant in British Columbia.

“We need more vaccine down here on the Cape, now,” said Bruce G. Murphy, health director for the town of Yarmouth, Mass., on Cape Cod, which has 82 active cases among its population of just more than 23,000.

The town has a sizable Brazilian community; 13 previous and current infections were caused by the P.1 variant, most likely introduced by travelers, according to tests conducted by the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.

Mass-vaccination centers in the Boston area are little help to Yarmouth residents, especially older people who cannot travel, Murphy said.

“If we see 13 [cases], that could be just the tip of the iceberg coming in,” he said.

Michigan also has asked for more vaccine to control an astonishing surge during which its average daily coronavirus caseload rose from 1,503 on March 7 to 7,020 Wednesday, according to CDC data analyzed by The Washington Post.

Asked whether the administration would ever change its strategy, Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House coronavirus response team, said Wednesday that the government already is able to move vaccine supply from other parts of a state to harder-hit areas.

“We are getting the amount of vaccines we think are needed for the population because that’s fundamental,” Slavitt said. “And then we are working on very tactical areas . . . how to maximize that vaccine distribution so we get the things we want: efficiency, health equity and the other goals that we have.”

In addition to those three variants, the CDC considers two in California “variants of concern” and is watching them closely. It is also monitoring a variant found in New York City.

With most of the rest of the world far behind on immunizations, the virus will continue to spread and mutate, every copy with the potential to spark a variation that current vaccines will not be able to control. The odds of that remain low, experts think, but they are not zero.

“I fear there will be one terrible variant that will come out and take us back to square one,” Ho said.

But experts said vaccines can be boosted, and new ones developed, to address any variants that emerge.

As of April 6, there were 16,275 cases of B.1.1.7, 386 of B. 1.351, first discovered in South Africa, and 356 of P.1 in the United States. Experts think the actual numbers are much larger, but because the U.S. effort to sequence the genomes of the virus lags, it is difficult to know how widespread the variants truly are.

“The landscape is this big explosion of U.K., the worrisome uptick in P.1 and then other strains as well,” said Daniel Jones, vice chairman of the Division of Molecular Pathology at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Within a few weeks, he said, there will be enough infections in the United States to gather better data on immune response from people, rather than through tests in a laboratory.

Lab tests usually involve looking at one mutation at a time; the variants circulating can have many, said Stephen Kissler, an immunology expert at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

And “the human immune system is much more complex than we can emulate in a petri dish, so we can only get partial information,” he said.

Found in more than 24 countries and 25 U.S. states, P.1 is thought to be up to 2.2 times as contagious and 61 percent more infectious than the original form of the virus. In other words, it produces a bigger viral load, which probably makes people sicker.

Some experts have wondered whether competing variants have slowed its spread. Northern California, for example, is dominated by B.1.427/B.1.429 cases, while Southern California has a higher share of B.1.1.7.

Story continues below advertisement

“We are seeing different variants in different parts of the country competing to take over populations,” said Benjamin Pinsky, medical director of the Stanford Clinical Virology Lab.

For now, B.1.1.7 appears to be dominant. According to the latest data from Helix, a company that is working with the CDC to track variants, B.1.1.7 comprises about 50 percent of all sequenced cases in the United States.

“My feeling is if you went in a boxing ring with all the variants, the U.K. variant is going to win in terms of transmissibility,” said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California at San Francisco.

That is good news in at least one respect, because studies have shown that vaccines should work on the variant first identified in the United Kingdom. Ho and others said the U.K. variant is most susceptible to the immune response produced by vaccines, with a modest drop-off in effectiveness against the variant first identified in Brazil and a slightly larger decline for the South African strain.

Immune response to the P.1 type “is going to be better than the South African variant but probably not as good as the U.K. variant,” Ho said.

The variants discovered in California appear to be potentially more benign than the others. Several states with B.1.1.7 surges have reported unusual outbreaks among school-age children that spreads to their communities, but that hasn’t been the case for the California variants.

“We’ve dropped hospitalizations really low” in areas where B.1.427/B.1.429 is becoming dominant, Chin-Hong said. “You’d expect to see more cases among kids and spring breakers, but we haven’t seen that. It suggests it’s not marking its territories by making younger people sicker.”

In Canada, public health officials have been struggling with the largest P.1 variant surge outside Brazil. There were more than 787 cases in British Columbia as of Tuesday, and a small but growing number in the adjacent province of Alberta. It has sickened young skiers at the Whistler Blackcomb resort and workers at an energy company. Twenty-one players and four staff members of the Vancouver Canucks hockey team have been infected by a variant of the virus, although the team has not determined which one.

Deena Hinshaw, chief medical officer for Alberta, tweeted Monday that her team was investigating a P.1 outbreak linked to “a large employer” that began with a traveler who returned from a trip out of province. She said there was a separate workplace outbreak in a different part of the state.

Hinshaw said that the province had identified 887 new cases over the previous 24 hours and that 39 percent of active cases are now variants.

In Connecticut, the variant first discovered in the United Kingdom has helped give 20- to 29-year-olds the highest case rate of any age group in the state. Whether that reflects properties of the variant, relaxed precautions among young people or vaccinations that are protecting older people — or some combination of the three — is not clear.

Another variant, originally detected in India, has been making headlines in California this week as a “double mutant” because it contains characteristics from the variants first discovered in California and Brazil/South Africa.

Described by Indian researchers on March 24, it was first identified in the United States March 25 in a patient in the San Francisco Bay area.

Pinsky said “it’s too soon to tell how this variant will act. We know how these individual mutations change the virus but we haven’t been able to see how they behave in combination.”

Brazil, now fully in the grip of the P.1 variant, shows how quickly it can seize control when not taken seriously. In the Amazon rainforest, it quickly devastated the city that spawned it, then stormed south. It was soon prevalent all over the country — and its assault on Brazil, now in the midst of a nationwide medical failure, has been merciless ever since.

Nearly 67,000 Brazilians died of covid-19 — the disease caused by the virus — in March, more than double any other month during the pandemic. The highest death toll — 4,195 — was recorded Tuesday. Scientists haven’t proved that the variant is more deadly. But physicians and health officials in Brazil say it has signaled a darker and deadlier phase of the pandemic.

The vaccination rate in Brazil is lagging far behind the rate in the United States.

105,"Jamin Davis began last season off the NFL’s radar. In a few weeks, he could be a first-round pick.","He idolized running back LaDainian Tomlinson, and even though his mother made sure to keep him involved in other activities — baseball, soccer, track — football spoke to him in ways no other sport could.

That secret his family discovered years ago is one the rest of the nation is beginning to realize. After only one full season as a starting linebacker at Kentucky — and after a limited pre-draft process — Davis has transformed from a relative unknown to a potential first-round pick.

Story continues below advertisement

“I mean, I didn’t honestly know who he was during the fall,” said NFL Network’s Daniel Jeremiah. “Nobody had said anything to me about him, and then you’re kind of going through and watching on tape and this guy just jumps off the screen.”

ESPN’s Todd McShay, who didn’t include Davis in mock drafts two months ago, most recently projected Davis as the 29th pick, to the Green Bay Packers. McShay’s colleague Mel Kiper recently ranked Davis as the 14th-best overall prospect and second-best linebacker, behind Penn State’s Micah Parsons.

Davis wasn’t even among Kiper’s top 10 linebackers in February.

“I’ve been messing with Mel about it because I told him about Jamin Davis and had him going late in the first round, and then he bumped him up to like [17] overall. I was like, ‘Listen, Mel, you didn’t even know this guy before I told you about him.’ But he obviously did.”

Davis, 22, didn’t receive Associated Press or coaches’ all-Southeastern Conference honors last season, despite totaling 102 tackles (third most in the SEC), three interceptions (one he returned 85 yards for a touchdown), a forced fumble and fumble recovery, and a blocked kick. And he wasn’t in the national discussion of top players early this year, despite a college resume that, while limited to 10 games, now has many believing he can be a coveted three-down linebacker in the NFL.

At 6-foot-4, 234 pounds, Davis is a wall of muscle equipped with rare speed (he ran the 40-yard dash in unofficial times of 4.41 and 4.37 seconds at his pro day), obvious athleticism (42-inch vertical and 11-foot broad jumps) and the ball skills to be a menace in coverage.

“This isn’t some overnight sensation,” said Kentucky Coach Mark Stoops. “... He’s done a lot of work for a lot of years to put himself in this position.”

‘He just wants to hit people’

Davis was only about a year old when his family moved from Honolulu to Georgia. His parents, now both retired army veterans, divorced not long after, and Tanga Davis made a point to keep her children — daughter Tenisha, and sons Jamin and Treyon — in multiple activities during a difficult time.

“When I first started playing, that was just my escape from everything,” Davis said. “I just fell in love with it the first time I scored a touchdown, and from that moment on, my love for the game just shot through the roof. It was kind of just my way of showing everybody in the area that I’m gonna be a baller one day.”

Davis got his first taste of the game on the Fort Stewart military base, about an hour south of Savannah, before joining the local rec teams.

“He always had been skinny all the way up until probably high school,” Tanga Davis said. “When you look back at the pictures, I didn't realize he was so skinny compared to now.”

Though the dream then was to be like Tomlinson, it wasn’t long before Davis took a liking to a different position. When Davis was around 8, his rec league coach pulled his father aside and asked him to speak to his son. “‘I’m trying to get him the ball,’ ” James recalled the coach saying, “ ‘but he just wants to hit people.’

“He’s a totally different person [on the field].” James continued. “He’s just focused. It’s like David Banner turning into the Hulk — he’s going to get there and he knows what he’s got to do, and he just focuses on completing the mission.”

Davis understood the game at a level few kids his age could. And the advice one of his coaches gave him early on has stuck with him for years. The coach told his team that “you can’t have a million dollar dream without a minimum wage work ethic.” Davis took it to heart.

“From elementary school through middle school, even up to high school, it never left my mind,” he said. “It's true: You're going to get out of it whatever you put into it. It was just something that throughout high school I learned, especially being from a smaller area. You can't have these dreams of playing in the SEC or playing in the NFL if you're not doing the work to get to that level.”

At Long County High in Ludowici, a town of about 2,600 in southeast Georgia, Davis became a standout receiver and linebacker, compiling 131 tackles as a junior and 126 more as a senior while offering glimpses of what he’d do at Kentucky. After a slow start to his recruitment, Davis committed to Kentucky in part because it was the first program to offer.

But he arrived all of 195 or so pounds and had to bide his time. Kentucky’s linebacking corps was deep and Davis’s first couple of seasons, following a redshirt year, were as a special-teamer and backup linebacker.

“I knew that eventually I was going to get a chance to show what I’m really about and to show everybody who I am as a player,” he said. “The way that it unfolded, it was just crazy.”

Jon Sumrall, the former Kentucky linebacker hired in 2019 to coach the position for the Wildcats, said Davis was the team’s most improved player in the spring that year, but a nagging hamstring injury during the summer hindered his start to the season. In the final stretch of the year, Davis’s production began to match his potential. He recorded at least six tackles in each of the team’s final four games. He also had an interception and a sack.

“That’s really when I was like, ‘All right, it’s about to happen,’ ” said Sumrall, who was recently promoted to Kentucky’s defensive coordinator.

‘Take a bet on myself’

In May, starting “mike” linebacker Chris Oats suffered a stroke and spent months at a rehabilitation facility. Though his condition created opportunity for Davis, it also shook a team that would be tested again. In addition to the challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, Kentucky assistant coach John Schlarman died in November after a two-year cancer fight.

“It was extremely hard for a lot of us,” Davis said. “We just had to find a way to keep going.”

To honor Oats, a different Kentucky player would wear his No. 22 jersey each week. Davis wore it during the Wildcats’ 24-2 win over Mississippi State, when he recorded 11 tackles and an interception.

“Jamin and Chris and [linebacker Deandre] Square, those three were thick as thieves,” Sumrall said. “ … I think through Chris’s trials and what he’s had going on, it’s maybe centered Jamin and lit even a bigger fire underneath him to make the most of every day and to not take anything for granted and to honor your brother in how you go about your work every day.”

Though Davis entered the 2020 season with only one start at linebacker, he had completed a physical transformation, from that 195-pound teenager years earlier to a 234-pound man. He pushed himself to become more vocal on the field — to be that “general,” like he described Ray Lewis — and often arrived an hour early to Sumrall’s meeting to learn the intricacies of the defense or watch film of opponents.

“I think he felt the sense of urgency to step his game up and take the next step,” Sumrall said. “He went from a guy who did what he had to do to prepare each game and each week and each practice to a guy that was preparing like he was on a mission.”

Among the most notable stops on his mission was Knoxville, Tenn., where Davis returned an interception 85 yards, flipped his way into the end zone, then gave a memorable recounting of the play to reporters afterward.

“I thought I was about to pass out for a second, man. I’m just like, sheesh,” he said. “A pick-six, let me go ahead and get it — might as well just run my balls off. And I made it. Hope my mama’s proud of that one.”

Days after Davis helped seal Kentucky’s Gator Bowl win over N.C. State with an interception, he declared for the draft.

“That was one of the hardest decisions I ever made in my life,” he said. “In the back of my mind, I was thinking that I should just take a bet on myself.”

‘He’s a complete guy’

For the first three months of the year, Davis trained with the agency Athletes First’s draft group at ProActive Sports Performance in Southern California. His regimented schedule of workouts and recovery sessions were packed around multiple Zoom calls with NFL teams.

As NFL interest in Davis has increased, his name has shot up draft rankings and his play has drawn praise by analysts.

“I love watching him because he reads the play so quickly, especially on run plays. He just shoots that gap,” McShay said. “He sees it so fast.”

But the new gold standard for inside linebacker is the player who can not just chase down backs in the running game but also cover tight ends and occasionally wide receivers in the passing game. Davis was one of six linebackers last year — including the nation’s top defensive player, Zaven Collins — to have at least three picks, and now many analysts rank Davis as the No. 2 inside backer behind Parsons.

“To me, his ability to defend the run and then to be able to cover, he’s a complete guy,” McShay said. “And you saw the pro day workout — his numbers are outstanding. … I can’t say enough good things about him.”

Yet Davis’s intrigue goes beyond his physical skill. He is an avid NASCAR fan, and aspires to be a lawyer when football ends because he knows it eventually will. He’s a self-described introvert with football as his focus, but he’d stay late after team dinners to play with Sumrall’s kids and his neighbor’s kids.

Sumrall said he knows that Davis’s on-field talents are special, but his character is even more so. And perhaps, finally, the NFL is discovering what he — and Davis’s parents — saw long ago.",0
106,"U.S. Olympians embrace latitude to speak out at trials, but IOC’s Rule 50 looms","Biles, 24, said she previously would have worried about what former national team coordinator Martha Karolyi and others might have thought. But she has grown since her 2016 Olympic debut. “I’m not a little girl anymore,” she said. And so Biles has thought about demonstrating in some fashion given the new USOPC guidance, which, for instance, allows athletes at trials to raise their fists on the podium, kneel during the national anthem or wear a face mask that reads “Black Lives Matter.”

“Now that I’ve kind of found my voice, I feel like not only can it benefit me, the team and the people that I’m supporting and advocating for, but it kind of helps everybody,” Biles said. “People get to see a little bit of who you are, just besides an athlete, and what you stand for. And I think that’s really neat.”

As soon as the USOPC announced the decision to allow such demonstrations, Biles said she thought, “Oh my gosh, we could do so much with the leos.” A few college gymnastics teams have worn leotards this season that featured symbols of racial justice, such as a raised Black fist or “BLM.”

The USOPC’s stance on these demonstrations stands in stark contrast to that of the International Olympic Committee; the IOC adheres to Rule 50 of the Olympic charter, which prohibits “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda.” The USOPC developed its new guidelines in consultation with an athlete-led council focused on racial and social justice. Sarah Hirshland, CEO of the USOPC, said the IOC is gathering feedback related to Rule 50 from athletes around the world. Hirshland said she expects to hear within a few months what the IOC found through that survey and if the international governing body plans to adjust Rule 50.

“We made the determination we made based on what is right for the Team USA athletes, our belief and our fundamental values as an organization,” Hirshland said during a U.S. Olympic media event this past week. “We’ve given that perspective and feedback to the IOC. We also recognize they operate in a global environment, and to expect 206 countries to have similar circumstances would be a tall order.”

If Rule 50 does not change, athletes in Tokyo will not be allowed to demonstrate in support of social justice, despite calls from athletes to overturn the rule.

“Personally, I don’t agree with the limitations on the protests,” said swimmer Lilly King, a 2016 Olympic gold medalist. “I know the Olympics is about the spirit of the Olympics and fairness and fair play, and I don’t see why that should be restricted to just sports. I think social justice and fairness in life in general should be celebrated.”

Until recently, the USOPC penalized athletes in line with Rule 50. At the 2019 Pan American Games, hammer thrower Gwen Berry raised her fist during the national anthem and fencer Race Imboden knelt on the podium. The USOPC placed both on probation. After George Floyd died in police custody last year, sparking worldwide protests of racial injustice, the USOPC’s stance began to shift in support of athletes’ right to protest.

Sprinter Allyson Felix, a four-time Olympian, said she had been part of calls in which other athletes expressed how they would like to have the freedom to speak out on social issues while in the field of play.

“I’m really excited to hear that news,” Felix said of the USOPC’s decision to allow demonstrations at trials. “I think that others would be as well. I don’t want to speak on behalf of anybody, but it’s a major step. And I think the impact will be that hopefully there will be awareness to a lot of important issues, especially issues that affect our individual communities.”

In recent years, and particularly after Floyd’s death, athletes, teams and leagues have become increasingly comfortable with advocating for social justice. The WNBA has been at the forefront of many of these pushes. Allisha Gray, who plays for the Dallas Wings and is an Olympic hopeful in three-on-three basketball, said, “It just shows the unity of the league and what we stand for, and we’re on the right side of things.”

In 2016, Minnesota Lynx players wore shirts in warmups that supported the Black Lives Matter movement, and off-duty police officers who were providing security walked off the job. In the years since, athletes have embraced a larger role in conversations about justice and equality.

“It’s amazing to see how far we’ve come as a group, as athletes in this country,” Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. women’s soccer team said. “Athletes are in unique position in this country that is obsessed with sports. … How so many athletes have sort of taken that responsibility on themselves, knowing the influence that we can have, I think is really inspiring.”

Over the weekend, 19-year-old gymnast Morgan Hurd, an Olympic hopeful, spoke at a “Stop Asian Hate” rally in New York. Hurd, who was adopted from China, gave a passionate speech about racism that Asian Americans endure in the United States after eight people, including six Asian women, were killed in shootings in the Atlanta area last month.

While speaking at the rally, Hurd referenced a recent Instagram post from fellow U.S. gymnast Yul Moldauer, who was adopted from South Korea. Moldauer said after honking at a woman who cut him off while driving, she yelled at him to “go back to China” when both cars reached a red light. Hurd has been a vocal advocate of many social justice causes, and the USOPC has now opened the door for athletes to take those stances at trials without fear of repercussion.

“A lot of people are like, ‘Oh, you’re an athlete,’ ” Biles said. “But we’re not just athletes; we’re people, too. And we have a right to speak up for what we believe in.”",0
107,"Maryland’s Aaron Wiggins, Eric Ayala declare for NBA draft while maintaining eligibility","Wiggins cracks the top 100 on some lists of draft prospects, and he could rise into the second round if he impresses during pre-draft workouts. The NBA draft combine is June 21 to 27. Players must withdraw from the draft by July 19 to preserve their collegiate eligibility.

“Eric and Aaron are making smart decisions to get feedback from NBA organizations that will lead to informed choices for their futures,” Coach Mark Turgeon said in a statement. “They are both incredible representatives of the University of Maryland and we will support them throughout the entire process.”

Wiggins, a 6-foot-6 wing from Greensboro, N.C., averaged 14.5 points this season, second on the team behind Ayala. Wiggins played particularly well in the last few months of the season. He averaged nearly 17 points in the final 15 games, and in Maryland’s season-ending loss to Alabama in the second round of the NCAA tournament, he scored a career-high 27 points. Wiggins also was second on the team in rebounds at 5.8 per game, and he became one of the team’s best passers, averaging 2.5 assists.

Wiggins has improved each season in College Park. Following the departures of forward Jalen Smith and point guard Anthony Cowan Jr. last offseason, he became Maryland’s best player, and he played with more confidence and aggressiveness.

Ayala led Maryland in scoring at 15.1 points. The Terps didn’t have a true point guard, so Ayala handled that role until sophomore guard Hakim Hart took over later in the season. Point guard Fatts Russell, a Rhode Island transfer, recently committed to the Terps, so neither player would not need to play on the ball as much next season.

If Ayala and Wiggins return to Maryland, Turgeon could have an experienced starting lineup of the two senior guards, Russell, junior forward Donta Scott and center Qudus Wahab (a transfer from Georgetown).

In that scenario, Maryland would have Hart and senior forward Jairus Hamilton coming off the bench. James Graham III, a 17-year-old rising sophomore guard/forward who joined the team as an early enrollee in December, could become a key rotation player after an offseason of development. Maryland will also welcome two freshmen: power forward Julian Reese and shooting guard Ike Cornish, both four-star prospects from Baltimore.

Following the departures of sophomore center Chol Marial and freshman point guard Aquan Smart, who both chose to transfer after playing sparingly, Turgeon has one more scholarship to fill.

108,"Howard University, with a coach’s moxie and a superstar’s money, takes on golf","He’s wearing a Bison face mask that creeps below his graying mustache and a hat emblazoned with the logo of NBA superstar Stephen Curry. He towers from the top of the hill, arms crossed, mostly silent. Here — on any course, really — is where Puryear finds peace. If he had his way, he would get lost on its rolling hills and blend in with the Bermuda grass.

“Like a ghost,"" Puryear says. ""I’m okay with people not knowing that I exist.”

But Puryear, a 50-year-old Black man, sticks out in a sport still grappling with a centuries-old diversity problem. This week in Augusta, the Masters will honor Lee Elder, who broke the tournament’s color barrier in 1975. But nearly a half-century after Elder’s achievement, there are just four African Americans on the PGA Tour. It’s still rare to see a Black golfer in the NCAA, still a marvel to see young Black kids competing in a game where, according to one study, just 3 percent of recreational players are Black.

Puryear is trying to change all that. With help from the seven-figure donation Curry made to Howard in 2019, the coach is building a Division I men’s and women’s golf program. The donation will help sustain the program for six seasons, covering some scholarship costs, the head coach’s salary and those key-lime green shirts that some of the players are wearing this March afternoon. But with the team preparing for its first tournament, Puryear must handle everything else.

That includes securing somewhere for his golfers to practice their short game. While local programs such as Georgetown and Maryland have home golf courses, Howard doesn’t. So ahead of the team’s season-opening tournament, Puryear spent the week calling courses. Woodmont, in Rockville, agreed, giving Howard players an afternoon to practice before leaving for their trip.

His team’s been practicing for less than an hour when Puryear notices a white-haired man heading their way. Puryear watches as the man approaches a photographer shooting pictures and asks what’s going on. The curiosity, the looks, the questions: Puryear would rather be invisible, but his team gets this a lot.

“I’ve told them so many times,” Puryear says quietly, “how this is going to be.”

East Lake transformation

Growing up, Puryear wanted to be just like his dad. And since Samuel Sr. played golf, he wanted to as well. He loved the game like his father, despite the game not always loving people who looked like them back.

As a boy, his father made 60 cents a day for carrying “some racist clown’s golf bag,” as Puryear wrote in his self-published memoir, “Diamonds in the Rough.” Those stories from Black caddies angered him, but Puryear thought he could do something about it. When he was 12, he says, he made a vow to his mother.

“That I was going to change the game of golf,” Puryear recalls. “Instead of anger, I said: ‘Okay when I got older: I’m going change it.’”

Puryear attended Tennessee State University, the Historically Black College famed for its Tigerbelles track program, and played under Catana Starks, the first Black woman to coach a men’s golf team. (Taraji P. Henson stars in the 2013 movie “From The Rough,” based on Starks’ life.)

He taught middle school journalism for several years before he found a job where his two passions collided: golf and mentoring. In 1998, he moved to Atlanta to teach golf to youth from the East Lake neighborhood, a community then known as “Little Vietnam.”

Through nine years as the executive director of the East Lake Junior Golf Academy, Puryear made a promise to every kid. If they stuck with him, they would go to college.

That dream didn’t always seem reachable. One of his kids had to duck for cover when his family’s apartment was shot up, he says. Two of his golfers were falsely accused of robbery and arrested after leaving the 18th green. A few took up gambling on the course so they could make money to buy food. Puryear raided his closet to give away shoes and clothes. And some nights, dinner at the Puryears, a family of five, was dinner for ten so his golfers could have something to eat.

Through it all, he kept his promise. From his class of 2007 students, he says six signed to play collegiate golf, and in total Puryear estimates more than 50 kids went on to college.

“The world needs that. The world needs a true picture on what’s out there,"" he says of Black kids excelling in golf. “[And] these young people need to see that they have the ability, they can dream, they can be anything they want to be. If this is the game they chose to play, they can play.”

“This,"" he says, ""is my ministry.”

Building blocks

When he heard it, he laughed.

It was 2008. After serving as an assistant coach on Stanford’s national championship-winning team, Puryear was hired as the head golf coach at Michigan State, becoming the first African-American coach of a Power Five conference team.

But he wasn’t always welcome in big-time college golf.

“I got called the ‘n-word’ a couple times,” Puryear says.

He’s open about his personal life, including his divorce, which he attributes to entanglement with his golf “ministry.” He’s more hesitant to discuss incidents of racism he faced while coaching at “PWIs,” or “predominantly White institutions.” But at Michigan State, he says, he overheard a collegiate golfer call him the “n-word,” and chuckled at the young man’s misguided audacity.

""I’ll just leave it at that,” Puryear says.

After four years at Michigan State and one Big Ten conference title, Puryear moved back to North Carolina to be closer to family. He led the Queens University of Charlotte program for several seasons, then left to pursue his own business, Pure Swing Golf Solutions.

When Howard received Curry’s gift — neither he nor the school has revealed the exact amount — it had the means to launch its golf teams. More than 50 years ago, Howard had a successful program that went undefeated in 1968 and won two conference championships in the 1970s, a school official said. But the program did not compete in Division I golf and disbanded after winning those conference trophies.

Kery Davis, the school’s Director of Athletics, envisioned Howard not only starting anew for its inaugural 2021 season but building a program that could compete with PWIs. He hired Puryear.

“He saw it,” Davis says of sharing big goals with Puryear. “I want coaches who have the same vision.”

Story continues below advertisement

Puryear started constructing the program last year. He didn’t have much time to find his building blocks, so he went searching. He signed sophomore Edrine Okong, who he first met while teaching a golf clinic in Uganda. And one day after Hampton University discontinued its golf program, Puryear contacted junior transfer Everett “EJ” Whiten Jr.

Then, he got a tip from a fraternity brother about Gregory Odom, Jr., who had entered the transfer portal after growing discontent with University of Memphis. Puryear started calling every week. Odom had never considered attending an HBCU since only 24 schools have a golf team, according to Black Golf Directory.

“I really wasn’t digging it at first,” Odom says. “I really just thought it was a false hope.”

Advertisement

At Memphis, Odom was the only Black golfer on the team. In 2020, the NCAA recorded 2,903 athletes in Division 1 men’s golf. Only 2 percent (59 golfers) were Black. Odom felt like an outsider with the way he dressed and the music he wanted to listen to. He was tired of constantly toning himself down to fit in. Eventually, he says, he recognized Howard and Puryear as his best fit.

“You can’t communicate the same the way the other teammates can with the coach,” Odom says of his time at his former school. “That’s what I love about Sam. ... He is one of us.”

Converting the curious

Now the man at Woodmont is walking toward Puryear. The coach, a guest, venerates the stranger, who’s presumably a member, saying how he’d like to teach Howard golfers as much about the game that the older man has already forgotten.

“They leave Sunday for Williamsburg,” Puryear tells him.

“To play?” the man asks.

Yes, to play. It’s the Golden Horseshoe Intercollegiate, the program’s first tournament. The team will finish 13th out 16 teams, edging out Georgetown. Odom will place in the top 20. Puryear will drive the 15-person practice van, a first in 14 years. He’ll also do the fundraising, and he’ll keep calling until he finds a more permanent practice home, which he’ll eventually find at a different country club, Woodmore, in Prince George’s County. And he’ll turn his energy to the women’s program, which will start play in the fall.

“I feel like I’m putting Legos together. I’m literally building from the floor up,” he says. “I don’t sleep a lot.”

For now, though, he’s still in Rockville, with the man who can’t believe that Howard has a golf team.

“Division III?” the man wonders.

No, Division I, Puyrear says.

“One?!” the man says, and then keeps talking, as Puryear listens politely.

“The fact that you play is good,” he tells Puryear. “And there’s no pressure. If you lose, you lose.”

The white-haired man stays a bit longer, watching bunker shots roll to a stop a few away from the cup. Puryear’s gaze stays on his golfers.

“That’s almost every time we go out,” Whiten Jr. says later. “It happens almost every time. When we go to these places … people want to take pictures and videos of us and it’s kinda — it’s kind of sad, but I’m getting used to it.”

The man says goodbye. Puryear thanks him for coming over, then returns to silently, peacefully, watching his team.",0
109,Umpire admits mistake on hit-by-pitch call that gave Mets walk-off win,"Marlins Manager Don Mattingly protested the call and it went to a replay review. However, per MLB’s rules on replays, only whether the ball actually hit the batter, in this case Conforto, was subject to review. Issues such as whether the pitch was a strike and whether Conforto made an effort to get out of the way are considered judgment calls and are not reviewable.

Once it was affirmed that the ball did graze Conforto’s elbow, the call stood and the Mets had a comeback win that even they acknowledged was a bit of a gift.

“We caught a little break,” said New York second baseman Jeff McNeil, who tied the game with a ninth-inning home run before a series of events culminated with the walk-off HBP.

After McNeil homered to open the bottom half of the ninth, Marlins closer Anthony Bass got a groundout and then gave up a single and a double. With runners at second and third, the Mets’ Francisco Lindor was intentionally walked to load the bases and get to Conforto, who has been struggling at the plate.

With the count 1-2, Bass threw a breaking ball that appeared to be headed to the upper inside corner of the strike zone. Kulpa certainly thought so, as he began to ring up Conforto, only to quickly change to a hit-by-pitch motion. That brought home New York’s Luis Guillorme, who was on third, and earned the ire of Mattingly.

“He didn’t get hit by a pitch — he got hit by a strike,” the Marlins manager said after the game. “That’s the thing. [Kulpa] went to call it, and then he says it hit him. So if it’s a strike, how can it be a hit by pitch?”

“Still kind of a little befuddled on what happened,” said Marlins catcher Chad Wallach. “I mean, we know what happened. He called it a strike and then changed his mind and called it a hit-by-pitch, so on that part we’re confused. I’ve never seen that before.”

MLB’s rule book states that a batter can proceed to first base if he is “touched by a pitched ball which he is not attempting to hit unless (A) The ball is in the strike zone when it touches the batter, or (B) The batter makes no attempt to avoid being touched by the ball.”

It looked like both of those conditions were met, although Conforto claimed he did try to move away.

“From my point of view, it was a slider. It felt like it was coming back to me, and I turned,” he said. “There may have been a little lift to my elbow just out of habit, out of reaction, and it barely skimmed the edge of my elbow guard.”

Even the Mets’ announcing team felt it was a bad call.

“He made no effort to get out of the way,” declared play-by-play man Gary Cohen as the telecast showed Mets players spilling onto the field in celebration. “It was a strike. … He stuck his elbow right into that pitch.”

“Obviously, not the way I wanted to win the ballgame. I wanted to go up there and put the ball in play and drive the ball somewhere,” said Conforto, who is batting .200 with one extra-base hit and two RBI in 15 plate appearances to start the season.

“I did see that [Kulpa] rung me up,” he added. “I think that’s why you didn’t see a reaction from me right away. I didn’t know what was going to happen.",0
110,Vaccine conversations can be messy. Here’s how to talk about the shots.,"While a poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in March showed that the share of Americans who have gotten vaccinated or want to right away is growing, 17 percent of Americans were still taking a wait-and-see approach, 7 percent were planning to get vaccinated only if required and 13 percent said they would definitely not get a vaccine.

“I don’t know if I’ve encountered one person that has not had challenges around these conversations, because there’s at least one or two people within your circle that have differing opinions on how to take care of themselves health-wise considering the vaccine,” said Akua Boateng, a licensed psychotherapist in Philadelphia.

Story continues below advertisement

Vaccination in general, Boateng and other experts say, is often a high-stakes topic tied to personal beliefs about health, safety and survival. In the case of the coronavirus vaccines, political views may come into play as well.

“It’s not like discussing the weather,” said Gregory Zimet, a behavioral scientist who studies vaccination and a professor of pediatrics in clinical psychology at Indiana University’s School of Medicine. “Unfortunately, coronavirus vaccines in particular became and continue to be highly politicized, so conversations about vaccines end up being, in some sense, conversations about politics, which are often fraught and highly charged and lead to alienation and polarization.”

But experts say it is possible to avoid straining or damaging your close relationships and still have productive conversations about vaccines with family and friends who don’t share your views. Here’s what they recommend.

Manage your expectations and set boundaries

It would be a mistake to enter a conversation convinced that you are going to be able to persuade another person to change their mind, said Paul H. White, a psychology professor at the University of Utah who studies attitudes and persuasion.

“If you’re going into it going ‘I am going to win this argument,’ you may, you may not,” White said. “And if anything, you may fray the relationship connections you have with your family, with your friends, with your close person.”

Zimet agrees, calling the approach a “set up for failure.”

“It’s human nature to get defensive when your belief system is being challenged and attacked,” he said. “People tend to identify with their belief systems and an attack on your belief systems feels very much like an attack on you.”

While it’s worth making an effort to talk to close friends and family members who appear to be unwavering in their views, Zimet said you should set your expectations low and adjust them based on how strong you perceive the other person’s stance to be.

It may also be helpful to have “a conversation about having a conversation,” Boateng suggested. “Identify your boundaries around what you feel comfortable talking about and what you don’t,” she said, adding that you can agree to create a judgment-free space or figure out what to do if tempers start to flare. This discussion, she said, “sometimes helps people to sort out the conflicts that might arise in having the [vaccine] conversation.”

Acknowledge concerns and figure out the reasons behind them

How you bring up the subject matters, Zimet said. Instead of asking pointed questions such as, “Why haven’t you gotten your vaccine,” you can try sharing your own experience with the vaccine and give others the opportunity to ask you questions.

If you’re talking to someone who isn’t ready to get vaccinated, it’s important to acknowledge their feelings and let them know that they aren’t alone, said Sunil Kripalani, a professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who studies health communication. “That allows you to begin with a position of empathy and understanding.”

Tamera Coyne-Beasley, a vaccine researcher who has also been engaged in national vaccine policy development, said she often starts conversations with loved ones by pointing out how confusing and difficult the decision can be.

“I realize that they’ve received a lot of conflicting information, particularly if they’re looking on the Internet or talking to people who aren’t familiar with vaccines,” said Coyne-Beasley, vice-chair and professor of pediatrics and internal medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “I want to acknowledge their concerns and understand what their issues may be.”

The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases recently released a report detailing various strategies to help with communication about covid-19 prevention measures and vaccines, said Coyne-Beasley, who is a member of the organization’s board of directors.

“You want to make sure that they understand that your recommendation is coming from your care for them and that you have no secondary gain other than to prolong their life and keep them and their family healthy because you love them and want them to be around,” she said.

You also shouldn’t make assumptions about why someone is reluctant to receive a vaccine.

“It’s important to take the time to understand the individual’s rationale and decision-making process rather than jumping right to ‘You should do this, and here’s why,’ ” Kripalani said.

Don't lecture, shame or threaten

When talking to a relative or friend, avoid becoming “preachy and moralistic,” said Vish Viswanath, a professor of health communication at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “At some point, if they feel that they are being disrespected, they’re not being listened to, that their concerns are not being validated, then they will pull away from you.”

Zimet suggested a strategy known as “motivational interviewing,” which includes asking if it’s okay for you to share what you know and your perspective.

Story continues below advertisement

You can also ask people what would help them feel more confident or increase their interest in getting vaccinated, Kripalani said. “It’s a disarming way to ask and it gives you something that is more positive to talk about, which can help move the conversation forward.” Be prepared to direct loved ones to sources they would trust, such as other family members, faith leaders, community groups, or prominent health officials and organizations.

One of the quickest ways to shut down a conversation is shaming the other person, White said. “If you’re wanting people to be vaccinated and you start telling them, ‘Well, this is selfish. You’re being horrible for not doing this,’ their almost natural response . . . is to defend themselves,” he said.

You should similarly try to keep yourself in check when encountering a relative or friend who is sharing misinformation, especially if it’s happening in a public forum such as social media. Rather than publicly contradicting or humiliating anyone, Zimet said, try to address misinformation issues in private conversations.

Experts also discouraged using threats of exclusion to persuade people to get their shots. Telling someone they won’t be invited to gatherings unless they’re vaccinated is harmful to relationships and “not appropriate for helping somebody through a medical decision,” Kripalani said.

Boateng recommended trying to find common ground, for instance, recognizing that everyone wants to stay healthy and safe. Then, she said, work together with family and friends to think of alternative ways to stay connected, such as spending time outdoors, wearing masks and staying distanced, or coordinating Zoom hangouts.

Know when to back off

Though conversations about vaccines aren’t likely to be resolved quickly, you should know when to stop. There are often clear signs, experts said. Sometimes a person will say they don’t want to talk anymore. “That would be the nice, easy neon-flashing sign,” White said.

Story continues below advertisement

Other signals to pay attention to include mood and body language, and where the discussion is going. If tempers are starting to rise and the conversation becomes combative or defensive, it’s time to back off. “The more you try to convince them, the more you’re reinforcing their beliefs,” Viswanath said.­ “At some point, you want to just let them be and wait for the right moment.”

That doesn’t mean giving up, Coyne-Beasley said. “You should always leave the door open.”

If, however, you can’t persuade your loved ones to change their minds and are feeling distressed, Boateng suggested taking time to process and seek support from other sources. “You’re just caring for yourself in a way that you would if you incurred emotional loss and emotional injury, all while affirming the bravery that it took to navigate caring for your health and your family’s health,” she said.",0
111,Pandemic baking helped me realize it’s not about the rolls,"I had a plan: I’d make the cinnamon rolls from scratch. I was excited about the prospect of making him something sweet. Food is comfort, and there’s nothing that’s been more comforting to me over the past year than baked goods.

I scoured the Internet for an easy recipe and found one for “one-hour cinnamon rolls.” (Reader, they took me way longer than one hour to make.) I’d been really enjoying baking during quarantine — I love the meditative quality of making something by hand, the patience it forces me to foster as I let the dough rise. Every Friday, I’ve been making a challah from scratch, and I love getting lost in the routine of kneading the dough, letting it rise, kneading it again. The smell of fresh bread fills my house, and for a moment, I can let go of the stress. I can let go of the worry.

This year has been difficult for everyone, but in different ways. My children are 9 and 11, and it’s been hard adjusting to our new reality. At school, they wear masks and wash their hands incessantly — they know that they are responsible for keeping themselves safe, which is equal parts empowering and terrifying. They worry about outbreaks, about getting sick; each day, our school district sends out an email to tell us how many teachers and students have tested positive. I’m a novelist, and my next book is due next month. It’s getting harder and harder to find pockets of time in which to do my work. It’s harder still, when I do find time, to clear my mind enough to let the creative flow in. My husband is a pediatric cardiologist and is seeing kids with a complication of covid-19 infection, as well as the infection itself.

We have ways to fight the stress: We take walks, we get fresh air. We think about what we’re grateful for, we think of ways to help others. We spend time together. We cook. We bake.

Still in pajamas, well before 8 a.m., I began. Reading the recipe, I carefully set out the ingredients I’d need: sugar, flour, butter, yeast. I made the dough, I made the filling, I made the frosting. (I didn’t have powdered sugar, so I took out my blender and made that, too.) I was so happy to be making something that my son wanted, something that I thought could be a bright spot in his day, when he’s had so many rough ones.

Story continues below advertisement

I served the cinnamon rolls fresh from the oven, just like the recipe described, and drizzled the frosting on top. My house smelled so delicious, and it made me feel just as warm as the cinnamon rolls themselves. I let my son pick the one he wanted, and then carefully used the spatula to put the cinnamon roll onto his plate. After taking a picture for Instagram (I’m only human), I set the plate on the table, ready for the praise to wash over me. After two bites, my son left the table.

“Is something wrong?” I asked him.

“No,” he said, and put his head down into his iPad.

“Why didn’t you eat it?”

“I didn’t really like them.”

I was crushed. I’d just spent over two hours baking, and I was exhausted. The kitchen was a mess — the countertops caked with dough, the sink overflowing with bowls and whisks. Couldn’t he taste the love that I’d baked into those cinnamon rolls? Couldn’t he taste the comfort I was offering through what I’d made?

Story continues below advertisement

Apparently, he could not.

I texted my husband: He didn’t like them! My husband responded with a laughing face emoji.

I texted my parents. They replied: Send the cinnamon rolls down to Florida! We’ll eat them!

I posted pictures of the baking process, from start to finish, on Instagram. Half a dozen friends asked for the recipe.

Everyone else seemed to like the cinnamon rolls. Everyone but the one person I made them for.

But then I realized — it didn’t matter. My son didn’t want them, and that was okay. Baking was a way that I showed my love to him, but it wasn’t the only way. He knew that I loved him by the way we talked about our days together, the way I was always around to discuss any problem, big or small. He could sense my love just as easily in the warm hugs I gave him, or the way I helped dry his hair when he came out of the shower at night. He felt my love in the squeeze of his hand, or the way I checked that his shoelaces were double-knotted before our daily walk.

And baking wasn’t just a way to show my love to my son. It was a way to show love to myself. It allowed me quiet, introspective time. When my hands were covered in flour, I could not check my phone relentlessly, poring over the news and social media. As I waited for the dough to rise, it reminded me that things that are worthwhile take time, take patience. The smells from the oven offered me comfort. They encouraged me to take a deep breath and soldier on.

I grabbed my son’s plate to taste the remainder of the cinnamon roll — perhaps I’d made a mistake with the recipe? A quick taste would tell me what I’d done wrong, or what I could do better the next time. I took a bite. There’s no other way to describe what I tasted: It was heavenly. I finished the entire roll and used my finger to eat the remaining bits of frosting. It tasted like butter. It tasted like sugar. It tasted like love.

112,"First modern Olympics, 125 years ago, was nothing like today’s huge spectacle","The 1896 Games were different from the worldwide sports spectacle of today. Only about 250 athletes from 14 countries participated in the first Games, and most were from Greece. At the most recent 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil, more than 11,000 athletes from 207 countries participated.

Another thing different about the 1896 Games: There were no female athletes. The first female Olympic athletes showed up at the 1900 Games in Paris, France. They participated only in croquet, equestrian, golf, sailing and tennis events. (Golf and tennis had women-only events.) The 2016 Olympics had more than 5,000 female athletes.

Some of the sports in 1896 were different. For example, the swimming events did not take place in a pool as they do today. The swimmers competed in the open waters of the Mediterranean’s Bay of Zea near Athens.

For longer races, such as the 1,200-meter freestyle, competitors were taken by boat to a wooden raft in the bay. From there, the swimmers dove into the cold (55 degrees) water and swam the required distance to shore. Their swimming lanes were marked by floating, hollowed-out pumpkins!

Some of the athletes were different, too. A 10-year-old boy participated in the team gymnastics competition. Dimitrios Loundras from Greece performed on the parallel bars, and his team came in third.

Dimitrios did not get a medal, however. In 1896, the winners received a silver medal, a certificate and olive branches. Second-place finishers got a bronze medal and laurel branches. Third place got nothing. The gold, silver and bronze medals were not given out until the 1904 Games in St. Louis, Missouri.

One event that was similar to today was the marathon. The race followed the legendary route that Pheidippides, a military runner, ran about 2,500 years ago from the Greek town of Marathon to Athens to announce that the Greeks had defeated the invading Persian army.

Spyridon Louis of Greece won the race. He ran the 25-mile course — marathons did not become a standard 26.2-mile race until 1924 — in 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds. Louis could have run faster, but he reportedly stopped to eat an egg and have a glass of wine in the middle of the race.

Any marathon is tough. About half the runners dropped out of the 1896 race. One runner was disqualified because he hopped a ride in a horse carriage for part of the race.",0

You are all assuming that your cousin’s mother was unfaithful to his father, resulting in the lack of a DNA tie to your father’s side of the family.

Isn’t it also possible that she conceived her youngest son through sperm donation?

Regardless of the answer, your cousin is obviously going through a very difficult time, and I hope you understand how this information might have completely upended his sense of his own identity, especially since he seems to have been so interested in and attached to this kinship with his father’s side of the family.

Get in touch with him and simply say, “I understand that this might be very difficult for you, but you are my cousin — first, last and always. I miss you and would very much like to stay connected.”

Do not expect him to share his genealogical research with you. This is the source of great pain for him. Let it go.

Dear Amy: Sometime after we got married, I went through my wife's phone and saw that she was communicating with her exes.

As they made advances toward her sexually, she never rejected their advances and remained in communication with them.

I confronted her about this, and she said she was ignoring them. Now she has changed her number, so they can't contact her.

I feel that was cowardly of her. I'd feel more comfortable if she rejected them, outright.

I believe that by only changing her number, she can always call them back if our marriage doesn't last.

What's your take on this?

— Confused Husband

Confused Husband: My take is that no one — you, your wife or her exes — seems to expect your marriage to last.

Story continues below advertisement

I agree with your overall point of view that once she married you, your wife should not engage in ongoing communication with former romantic or sexual partners, unless these people are in an active friendship with both of you.

It doesn’t matter which phone number your wife chooses — any person can contact any other person, through social media, instant messenger, email, postal mail, smoke signals, semaphore flag signals or Bob Woodward style — through leaving a flag in a flowerpot.

Most important is the lack of trust between you two. You should not feel the need to go through your wife’s phone and police her contact with other people. The fact that you do indicates the lack of trust at the core of your relationship.

Dear Amy: I identified with ""Stoner — Trying to do Better."" Like him, I also struggled to manage my cannabis habit.

I just wish that you (and others) didn't maintain this totally '50s attitude that pot use is bad. Would you say the same about alcohol? Cigarettes?

— Upset

Upset: Nothing in my answer conveyed a value judgment about pot use. It seemed that he had used it more or less effectively to manage underlying symptoms. Now he wanted to stop.

And, yes, if someone wrote to me saying that they were trying to kick their daily alcohol or nicotine use, I would support their effort to stop.",0
115,Miss Manners: Celebrity comparison rankles,"I realize people are trying to compliment me, but I really prefer not to hear I look like this person — or any person, for that matter. Is there a tactful way to respond to someone when it happens next?

Comparing someone’s looks to anyone else’s rarely goes as intended. Much like witty observations about another’s name, it tends to fall flat, cause insult or has been heard 38,346 times before.

To discourage it, Miss Manners suggests that you say something to the effect of, “Oh, no! I’m sure no one wants to be associated with that person right now.” Or, “Oh, dear! I suppose I will have to up my skin care game.” Realizing that the intended flattery has failed should make people less inclined to press on — or try it again on others.

Dear Miss Manners: For my 16th birthday, my grandmother had a very large amethyst made into a custom ring for me. She was not a typical ""sweet"" grandmother, and this was the only birthday gift I received from her after entering high school. I adored that ring and wore it nearly every day.

A few years later, it went missing. I looked everywhere, but it was gone. More time passed, and I visited my cousin for her wedding. She was wearing my ring on her finger! I have discovered that my grandmother stole it from my jewelry box a few years after she gave it to me, and then gave it to my cousin.

I have been devastated about this for many years and will be seeing my cousin soon. I would like to address this and have my ring returned to me, but not embarrass myself, my cousin or our mothers. How should I handle this?

Carefully. You would be accusing your grandmother of theft — and the rest of your family of aiding and abetting her. In addition, you would be taking something from your cousin that she no doubt values as much as you did — and to whose nefarious circumstances she was previously oblivious.

Miss Manners suggests that instead you approach the conversation with low expectations of getting the ring returned as you tell your cousin this “funny story” about Nana. If she knows your grandmother as well as you do, she will believe it is possible — especially if you do not immediately ask her to hand over the ring in question afterward.

116,"At 63, she enrolled at the university that sold her enslaved ancestors. Now she’s starring in a play about them.","A tale that would seem tailor-made for the stage. Which is where Short-Colomb has taken it.

“Here I Am,” written and performed by Short-Colomb, premieres online Tuesday as a live stream of Georgetown’s Laboratory for Global Politics and Performance, a decade-old cross-disciplinary program that uses the tools of drama to explore matters of civic urgency. That her stage on that day and three subsequent ones is the living room of her Washington apartment does not indicate a deficit of theatricality: her accomplished team includes playwright-adviser Nikkole Salter, multimedia designer Jared Mezzocchi, vocalist Somi Kakoma and director Derek Goldman, the lab’s co-founder.

Story continues below advertisement

“ ‘Here I Am’ is about not just me and what I have done at Georgetown,” Short-Colomb — who goes by “Meli” — said in a Zoom interview. “It’s about the 300-year history of the women of my family, their wounds, their children being born slaves.”

It’s also about accountability at a university whose history is entwined with her own. “This is an institution,” she said, “that enslaved my family for 150 years and then sold them, and then didn’t talk about it for another 180 years.”

The narrative linchpin of “Here I Am” was the public revelation more than five years ago that the university was the beneficiary in 1838 of the sale of 272 enslaved people by the Maryland Province of Jesuits, who ran the school and used the money to pay off its debts. (The number was later revised by researchers, to 314.) The debate over how the university could make amends continues; just last month, the Jesuits and descendants of the enslaved announced the creation of a Descendants Truth and Reconciliation Foundation. It plans to raise $1 billion in the effort to address “the legacies of enslavement in the United States and its impact on families and communities today.”

Short-Colomb, now 67, is not a professional actor, but the monodrama has become her megaphone for the personal impact of the tragedy. It turned out that she is a direct descendant of two enslaved people who were sold by the Jesuits, her “three-times-great-grandparents” Mary Ellen Queen and Abraham Mahoney. She learned of her family connection to Georgetown after being contacted on Facebook by university researchers looking into the genealogy of the #GU272.

Goldman and Lab co-founder Cynthia P. Schneider met with Short-Colomb in New Orleans in 2016; at the time, they were making plans for a play about the descendants, a project that was ultimately abandoned. It was as a result of these initial contacts that in 2017, Short-Colomb made a momentous midlife pivot.

“I decided to do something for me, and that was to apply and come to Georgetown, because of my relationship with Cynthia and Derek. They became my Georgetown family as soon as I got here.”

One of the courses Short-Colomb took was Goldman’s “Performance, Memory and Witness,” in which students created stories out of their family experiences. “Meli just started sharing her work in that context, and it was so powerful for the students just to hear,” Goldman recalled. “I knew within 20 minutes of meeting Meli that she was an amazing storyteller, and that she was made for the stage.” The work in the course would form the basis of the play that Short-Colomb decided to write.

Meeting Short-Colomb over Zoom, you instantly get the sense of a person of powerful self-possession, a woman positioned uncompromisingly at the center of her own story. On her first day on campus, she encountered the bronze statue of Bishop John Carroll, the university’s founder who in the late 1700s became the first Catholic bishop and archbishop in the United States.

“The title comes from me walking on my first day, August 11, 2017, through the gates of Georgetown, looking at John Carroll sitting up there and saying, ‘Well, here I am!’ ”

Born in New Orleans, Short-Colomb raised four children and eventually went to culinary school, a 22-year career that took her for a spell to St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where she decided “I’m not an island girl.” Short-Colomb was too restless for a year-round resort. “An opportunity, an idea, a circumstance presents itself,” she said, “and that’s what I do, move forward — always moving forward.”

“Here I Am” is her latest progression; there has been some interest from Hollywood, and a documentary is also in the works. But her only interest at the moment is honoring, through the play, the suffering of her forebears. That institutions as purportedly conscience-driven as the Catholic Church and Georgetown would be implicated in slavery only became clear to her as the facts of the 1838 sale, and family stories passed down to her, coalesced.

She wants it all laid bare, the depth and breadth of the history of institutions and people owning other people, and for White power structures to acknowledge the past and commit to reforms. “The timing of ‘Here I Am’ is so fortunate,” she said. “The ears of the country are tuned in, in a different way — at least the people with open ears.”

Salter, who’s had her plays produced across the country, including “In the Continuum” — written with Danai Gurira, at Woolly Mammoth Theatre — found Short-Colomb to be “a natural.” She advised Short-Colomb on shaping the personal and historical details, but it was the questions the budding performer raised that provided profundity.

“People who have become leaders of our nation are built on that decision,” Salter said of the 1838 sale. “There are conversations to be had today about how to recognize that: Can you be guilty of something you didn’t do? Or, at the same time, is the guilt that I now know about it and I could do something to reconcile it?”

The voluminous records that were kept at the time — including the list of names of the people sold — became an important facet of “Here I Am.” Mezzocchi, an expert in digital and projection design, and associate professor at the University of Maryland, embedded in rehearsals via Zoom. He and an assistant, Jeremy Bennett, pored over the documents to give the live-streamed production graphic texture. And Kakoma, who goes professionally only by her first name, Somi, had the assignment of creating a vocal score.

The concept of being present to tell one’s story — an idea implicit in the title — was where Kakoma got her inspiration. “I was very interested in figuring out how to sound like the spirits she is speaking on behalf of,” Kakoma said by Zoom from Kigali, Rwanda, where she was visiting relatives.

Now, Short-Colomb gets to put it all together, in a free presentation, beamed out from her living room. On Tuesday evening, she will emerge from her bedroom and walk into her show.

“It is a type of graduation,” Goldman said of “Here I Am.” “Not literally, but in a sense liberating her from the burden of carrying this story and leaving the accountability with an audience who can’t just sort of go, ‘Oh, I didn’t really know,’ or ‘I didn’t really understand.’ That’s not for Meli to carry. That’s for the rest of us to carry.”

Short-Colomb isn’t sure what happens now, after finishing eight semesters at Georgetown — for enrichment rather than a degree. But she’s staying in Washington for whatever comes next.

“People have asked me, how do you feel, walking around Georgetown’s campus?” she said, smiling. “I’m like, I feel like I own the place.”

117,Taylor Swift rattled country music when she went pop. But her ‘Fearless’ re-release pays homage to her Nashville roots.,"This was not an easy thing for some in the country music world to accept, given that she was one of the format’s most successful singers. Swift told Rolling Stone at the time that her record label president begged her to include a few country tracks on the album. She declined to do so.

While Swift has transformed into a pop megastar in the years since, she hasn’t completely left the genre behind. She has written a couple songs for other acts (Little Big Town’s “Better Man,” Sugarland’s “Babe”) and performed last year at the Academy of Country Music Awards. But on Friday, she paid homage to her country roots in the most significant way yet with “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),"" a rerecording of the 2008 album that won album of the year at the Grammy Awards, the top prize at both major country award shows, and launched her into superstardom with smash hits such as “You Belong With Me” and “Love Story.”

Incidentally, the reason for the rerelease stems from an incident with her former Nashville label, Big Machine. Two years ago, music manager Scooter Braun purchased Big Machine Label Group in a reported $300 million deal, meaning he became the new owner of Swift’s master recordings from her first six albums. Afterward, Swift penned a scathing letter saying that her masters being sold to Braun was her “worst case scenario”; she said he had “bullied” her for years and also alleged she wasn’t offered the chance to outright buy the masters herself. Swift promised she would rerecord all of her older albums so she would fully own them, therefore devaluing Braun’s purchase.

“Fearless (Taylor’s Version)” is her first step in that quest. While all the songs sound very similar to the past version, save for her more mature vocals and a few new production elements, she took extra steps to maintain it was still a very Nashville record.

First, she enlisted two of the genre’s current biggest stars to join her on songs from “the vault,” a collection of six tracks that Swift wrote years ago and wasn’t able to include on the original “Fearless.” Maren Morris, who once joined Swift as a guest performer on tour, is featured as a background singer on “You All Over Me.”

“One thing I’ve been loving about these ‘From The Vault’ songs is that they’ve never been heard, so I can experiment, play, and even include some of my favorite artists,” Swift wrote on Instagram in March. “I’m really excited to have @marenmorris singing background vocals on this song!!”

Story continues below advertisement

Keith Urban also shows up on two “vault” tracks: He plays electric guitar and performs background vocals on “We Were Happy,” and duets with Swift on “That’s When.”

“I’m really honored that @keithurban is a part of this project,” Swift wrote in another Instagram post. “I was his opening act during the Fearless album era and his music has inspired me endlessly.”

In addition to featuring artists, Swift has no doubt made some Nashville songwriters very happy as she revives their older tunes: Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey, two of the genre’s most reliable hit writers, collaborated with Swift on the title track. Big & Rich’s John Rich co-wrote “The Way I Loved You.” And the “vault” songs include tracks co-written by Scooter Carusoe, Tommy Lee James and Brad and Brett Warren.

Story continues below advertisement

Rose has more songwriting credits on “You Belong With Me,” “Tell Me Why” and the Grammy-winning “White Horse,” as well as vault tracks “We Were Happy” and “Bye Bye Baby.” In an interview with The Washington Post in 2016, Rose recalled initially receiving judgment from her colleagues when she wrote with a teenage Swift.

“I mean, I was catching flak: ‘What are you doing writing with a 14-year-old?’” Rose said. “I was like, ‘Hey, this kid’s brilliant, and it’s the easiest, funnest thing I do all week. And too bad y’all are not a part of it.’”

Swift proved quite a few skeptics wrong as she went on to not only sell millions of albums, but change country music forever as she proved that young listeners were a powerful fan base for the format. And now, as she dives back into her past work, it’s another reminder of what she brought to the genre — and what it lost when she moved on.",0

119,The world is fast. Bad Brains are faster.,"Electrocution, convulsion, possession, all of the above, all at once. That’s what it looks like, but it’s not. It’s H.R., frontman of Bad Brains, leading his untouchable hardcore punk band through a blazing three-night stand at New York’s CBGB in December 1982 during which various forces appear to be guiding his body: electric currents, neural misfires, holy spirits. But there’s only one force at work here, music, and he’s channeling it through the entirety of his physical form until total abandon and complete self-awareness seem to conjoin. Is that what freedom is?

This all happens inside the 60 minutes of “Bad Brains Live at CBGB 1982,” which doesn’t really play like a concert film so much as camcorder evidence of a supernatural event repeated three times within 72 hours. We need footage like this to exist. Otherwise, we might not fully believe the eyewitnesses who still describe Bad Brains as the greatest live band to ever visit our plane.

That said, we probably wouldn’t dismiss believers as the kind of people who saw the Virgin Mary in their toast, either. That’s because the two indomitable albums that Bad Brains dropped in this era — a self-titled debut from 1982 and 1983’s “Rock For Light,” both being self-reissued this year along with most of the band’s ’80s output — are crammed with anthems of exhilarating speed, secret finesse, deep purpose and immutable optimism. The world has sped up over the past four decades, but this music still feels fast. In increasingly hyperbolic times, it remains extraordinary.

And from those fortunate enough to have caught it in the air between 1979 and 1983, the testimony is practically unanimous. “I’d never seen anything like them,” said Denise Mercedes, guitarist of the Stimulators, describing her first Bad Brains show in the pages of “NYHC,” Tony Rettman’s oral history of New York hardcore. “The moment that they hit, it was like a bomb going off. It was louder, it was faster.”

So, an explosion? That might describe Bad Brains’ kinetic power as a physical sensation, but it doesn’t fully account for the music’s meaning. And as detonative as their songs felt, this band wasn’t destroying anything. Instead, they were inventing a powerful sound that adhered to their foundational credo of “positive mental attitude,” a can-do concept that H.R. had borrowed from the popular 1937 self-help tract “Think And Grow Rich.” The group’s advocacy for that mind-set, abbreviated in H.R.’s lyrics as “P.M.A.,” registered in bright contrast to the nihilistic gloom that clouded the dawn of the punk era. Instead of shouting at an impending apocalypse, Bad Brains seemed to be barreling their way toward whatever might come after.

These albums teem with other cosmic contradictions, too. The songs sound furious and ecstatic, the performances feel raw and precise, and all together, what seems like a molten volatility ultimately cools into a sustained act of supreme control. The only unambiguous feature of the Bad Brains’ sound is speed.

Tempo is a clockable thing. It’s a quantitative way to try to understand music’s qualitative mysteries. But with Bad Brains, speed is something to commit your attention to, even if you’ve heard the songs 500 times. There’s a nonperishable generosity to music that moves this fast. It can reveal new information each time it races by.

Still, it’s easy to get dazed by the simple physical feat of it. Imagine four Olympians sprinting 100-meters in lockstep toward a photo-finish tie for gold and you’re starting to get a picture of the kinesthetic telepathy between guitarist Gary “Dr. Know” Miller, bassist Darryl Jenifer, drummer Earl Hudson and his older brother H.R. (born Paul Hudson). According to the band, Earl set the tempo, starting the songs with a simple four count, but in Bad Brains nobody leads, nobody chases, nobody hurries ahead, nobody lags behind. Speed becomes an expression of collectivity. Or maybe even a virtue.

In terms of a career, the quartet didn’t get off to the quickest start. Bad Brains formed in Washington in the late ’70s, first as Mind Power, a jazz fusion group inspired by Chick Corea and Mahavishnu Orchestra, but eventually changed its name and vision after discovering the Sex Pistols and the Damned. Hoping to combine those British sneers with the radiance of Jamaican reggae, they proceeded to make an unprecedented noise that would inspire the D.I.Y. ethos of Minor Threat and their peers, quickly making Washington the epicenter of American hardcore.

When Bad Brains relocated to New York in 1981, they kick-started the scene there, too, then spent the rest of the decade dodging fame. One of the band’s earliest managers, Mo Sussman, shopped the group to major labels as “the Black Beatles,” but the band had already developed a phobia of the fine-print on record contracts — especially H.R., whose mercurial behavior foreshadowed his later struggles with mental health. Later in the ’80s, when H.R. reportedly skipped out on a meeting with Chris Blackwell, the Island Records founder credited with launching Bob Marley and U2, it seemed like Bad Brains would remain an off-and-on proposition.

Back in 1981, the band was still all the way on, at least onstage. “The way the world was moving in that era was making all of us play faster,” Jenifer, the band’s most discreet virtuoso, told Filter magazine in 2007. “We intended to play fast, but not as fast as we morphed into playing. We were only speeding up with the times, the motion of the whole scene.”

The front cover of Bad Brains’ 1982 self-titled album. (Bad Brains)

That’s one way to survive on a planet that’s spinning too fast: Outpace it. You can hear the band winning the race on their self-titled debut, something they recorded quickly and erratically across the spring, summer and fall of 1981 at 171-A, a four-track recording studio and performance space on Manhattan’s Lower East Side where the band sometimes lived and rehearsed. The results sound as bright, scorching and unrepeatable as that lightning bolt striking the Capitol dome drawn on the album’s iconic cover. It’s the kind of record that forms a permanent crease in your memory the moment you first encounter it.

Listen for the 501st time and you’ll hear new sparks shooting off it, too. For instance, ever notice that the most torrential moments of Dr. Know’s guitar solos tend to move up the fretboard like a rainstorm in reverse? Or how at the end of an especially locomotive burst of words, H.R. likes to curl his last syllable into a vertical shriek? Now listen to the rhythm section and try to imagine that 100-meter dash again, only this time at a 45-degree incline. Velocity is speed plus direction. This is ascension music — a sound rising in the direction of higher consciousness.

It seems absurd that a book like “Think and Grow Rich” had any kind of formative influence over a developing punk scene skeptical of capitalism, spirituality and the notion of hope in general, but everything about Bad Brains seemed to defy the odds. Written during the Great Depression by failed businessman Napoleon Hill, the book offered techniques for amassing personal wealth through positive thinking, and its success as perennial bestseller helped to establish the entire concept of American self-help — an optimism industry that Barbara Ehrenreich meticulously debunks in her 2009 book “Bright-Sided: How Positive Thinking is Undermining America.” Ehrenreich describes “Think and Grow Rich” as one of the “classics of self-delusion” designed to “harness the subconscious mind to conscious greed.”

H.R. allegedly latched onto the idea of “positive mental attitude” by complete accident, pulling the book off his father’s bookshelf after an argument about the direction of his life. In “Finding Joseph I,” a 2017 biography of H.R. by Howie Abrams and James Lathos, the singer described the band’s abiding ideology as swirl of tenacious self-improvement and wishful clairvoyance: “I think the philosophy was to have something positive to say — have some kind of prophetic message that would prove to people that we could do something better.”

What kept Bad Brains’ P.M.A. from evaporating into hardcore woo-woo was the band’s ability to shape reality, to transpose its optimism into a sound that literally moved people — including H.R., who occasionally punctuated his bandmate’s nonstop sound-gestures by landing backflips onstage, something he first practiced as a child while swimming in the ocean. That physicality extended to the audience, too. Before it became ritualized, slam-dancing emerged as an instinctual response to hardcore punk, and the term “mosh” is believed to originate from Bad Brains speaking in reggae slang and Jamaican patois from up onstage, asking the crowd to “mash it up.”

In all that push and shove, a sort of End Times optimism began to foment around the Bad Brains. The band grew more fervent in its spirituality and had fully adopted Rastafarianism by 1982 with H.R. singing about the fall of Babylon, a biblical concept that dovetailed neatly with the doom-saying so common to punk at the outset of the Reagan era. Just as he had repurposed Hill’s pseudo-metaphysical greed mantra into an underground humanist rally cry, he learned how to articulate a pacifist vision in a serrated punk snarl. “We don’t want no violence, we don’t need no wars,” H.R. sings on “Rock for Light,” the band’s brightest flash of utopianism. “We just want what’s right: Rock for light.”

It’s strange how we use the word “timeless” to praise the music we feel most loyal to — especially since music is a temporal art that relies on time in order for it to be experienced. And while it might be tempting to think of recorded sound as a replayable swatch of frozen time, scientifically, only light experiences true timelessness. Einstein taught us that time and space are relative: The closer you get to traveling through space at the speed of light, the slower time will move — and at light speed, time stops. The mathematical physicist Roger Penrose had a nice way of putting it: “Eternity is no big deal to a photon.”

The front cover of Bad Brains' ""Rock For Light"" album. (Bad Brains)

Try keeping these ideas in your head space when listening to “Rock For Light,” an album in which producer Ric Ocasek helped push Bad Brains even closer to light speed by speeding up the tapes while remixing the album with Jenifer in 1991. The forthcoming “Rock for Light” reissue restores the performances to their original speed (slower) and pitch (lower). It sounds infinitely better.

120,How cartoonists are portraying the battle over Georgia’s new voting law,"“They know Trump’s claim the election was stolen was a lie,” the left-leaning Pulitzer Prize winner says of Georgia Republicans, “but they’re using that lie to make it harder for Black people to vote in the name of ‘election integrity.’ I’m glad Coke and Delta are belatedly stepping up to condemn this and hope other corporations follow suit.”

The controversy escalated after Major League Baseball announced last week that it would relocate this summer’s All-Star Game from the Atlanta Braves’ ballpark in light of the new voting law. This week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said some corporations were wrongly aligning themselves with the Democratic interpretation of the law, adding in a statement: “Corporations will invite serious consequences if they become a vehicle for far-left mobs to hijack our country from outside the constitutional order.”

To satirize the situation, Luckovich drew Georgia Republicans pulling his unmoored state back into the 20th century. Yet he still has hope: “Georgians who are committed to participating in democracy will make their voices heard, no matter how difficult the GOP tries to make voting.”

One fellow Southerner, Clay Bennett, has also lampooned the new voting legislation.

“The recent attempts to suppress the vote in Georgia are just the latest chapter in a very long story in this neck of the woods,” says the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist for the Chattanooga Times Free Press. “Years ago, it was the Democrats, but today it’s the Republicans who embrace the notion that if you can’t win a fair fight, fight dirty.”

So Bennett rendered the stark image of democracy itself being lynched.

“Thinking back on the Jim Crow era brings me nothing but shame as a Southerner,” Bennett says. “Realizing that we haven't come all that far since then just brings on full-blown depression.

“I guess that might explain the imagery I chose to use to depict the latest attacks on democracy in the South.”

J.D. Crowe, the political cartoonist for AL.com and the Alabama Media Group, also says he believes the GOP is trying to suppress the votes in ways that hark back to the Jim Crow era. So he drew a political animal that is part Republican elephant and part crow.

“The winged crow-elephant image came to mind pretty quickly, but I fiddled with several positions for the beast: He was sitting on a voter’s head, squatting on a voting booth and a few other actions before he settled on the circuslike act of standing on the ballot box,” Crowe says.

“I really didn’t know it worked until I turned it loose on the readers. It was well-received by folks who agree with the point of the image — not so much with those on the other side of the issue. So I guess that elephant took flight.”

Age 8+

Silly canine grooming contest lacks bite.

“Pooch Perfect” is a reality series hosted by Rebel Wilson in which dog groomers showcase their work (with the help of dog models, of course) for a chance to win a cash prize. The bond between dogs and humans is clearly highlighted, but it’s hard to prove that all of the featured dogs enjoy the sometimes extreme grooming experiences. Language includes the word “b----,” and there is some play on words, like “I know my Shitzu.” There isn’t any violence, but you can expect some sad conversations about beloved dogs that died or that were stolen. Families’ mileage will vary depending on whether they see this kind of grooming as over-the-top or just a bit of fun. (Roughly 45-minute episodes) minutes)

Age 10+

Great characters and diversity in fun mockumentary series.

“Drama Club” is a series about a middle school drama club and the new student director who hopes to win schoolwide acclaim with an original new musical. Content is suitable for a tween audience, with anything even remotely questionable bound up in jokes. Cheerleaders go “Eww!” when the drama club is brought up; a teacher calls the drama club a bunch of “Lame-Manuel Mirandas”; and a student calls a teacher “lame” because he’s “old.” In one scene, an actor pays off the show’s light technician to drop a light on a rival (it misses her); in another, a student calls actors “trash with stage makeup.” Otherwise, language is confined to the odd “darn,” and sexual content is limited to moments like one in which a student longingly sighs the name of another one. Characters are presented somewhat stereotypically, but the show also takes time to subvert tropes, like when a football player breaks into ballet on the field and his teammates gather to watch appreciatively instead of mocking him.

Age 13+

Language, violence, big laughs in diverse superhero comedy.

“Thunder Force” is about childhood friends Lydia and Emily, who reunite as superpowered adults (Melissa McCarthy and Octavia Spencer, respectively) to fight off villains. It boasts positive, diverse superhero representations but also has quite a bit of action violence and salty language. Lydia and Emily demonstrate cunning, courage and teamwork, and Emily and her daughter are brilliant Black scientists whose inventions will save Chicago. The women get involved in brawls and knockdown fights, many of which include violence in the form of explosions, falls, Tasers and gun shots. People get squeezed to death and electrocuted and fall out of skyscrapers. One of the villains, Laser (Pom Klementieff), could frighten some viewers with her intensity and professed love of killing, and another’s eyes turn a menacing red when he gets angry. Lydia flirts with a villain known as the Crab (Jason Bateman), imagines dancing with him, goes out for a romantic date and goes home with him, where they start undressing each other. Language includes several variations on “s---” and “a--,” as well as “b----,” “damn,” “suck,” “hell,” anatomical terms like “balls,” “butt,” “tatas,” and taunts like “morons,” “loser,” “psycho,” “idiot,” “dork,” “wack job” and “nerd.” A character mouths “What the f,” and another stops at “Mother . . . ” Ultimately the movie offers the message that superheroes can come in all shapes, sizes, educational levels and genders — and that honesty and integrity win out over lying, cheating and scaring or hurting people.

122,The ‘Kardashians’ is ending. The Kardashians will never go away.,"The family was gathered in a hospital delivery room waiting for Khloé Kardashian to give birth, mere days after a video surfaced online that showed Khloé’s boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers NBA star Tristan Thompson, making out with another woman.

At one point, Kim stood behind Thompson’s back and dragged her finger across her throat in the universal gesture for “I’ll kill him,” and then laughed and stuck out her tongue. When he turned around, Kim quickly stopped making faces. “Are you going to say hi to each other, or no?” asked Khloé, who had decided to temporarily ignore the turmoil while in labor. Kim faked a smile and the two hugged. After Khloé delivered their daughter, Thompson waxed poetic. “They say girls change your life,” he mused. Kourtney Kardashian smirked and exchanged a knowing look with her sisters: “We can only pray.”

That scene on “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” captures so much about what both infuriates and delights people about the E! reality series that recently kicked off its 20th and final season. The Kardashians may flaunt their privilege (they took private jets to the hospital) and revel in fame (Thompson’s cheating scandal ignited the Internet), but they never escape the dynamics of fierce sibling loyalty and awkward family situations. Behind the outrageous wealth and cameras that follow them everywhere, they remain just that — a family.

“They’re so good at overcoming hardships, which is inspiring to people who are going through hardships in their own lives,” said Farnaz Farjam, an executive producer who has worked on the series since the Season 1 premiere in 2007. “Sharing the fact that you were cheated on, that’s embarrassing for people. … But then someone who has been cheated on watching [the show] at home can say, ‘Oh, it also happened to Khloé Kardashian? So I’m not a loser.’ ”

“Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” depending on whom you ask, is either aspirational, the height of escapism or the downfall of society. But no matter how you feel, its final episodes this spring mark the end of an era for reality television. The show proved that to enrapture an audience, there is power in sharing absolutely everything: relationships, fights, births, deaths, weddings, mental illness, body image issues, divorces, battles with substance abuse, criminal proceedings, filming an internationally mocked Pepsi commercial.

The series is also the end of an era for the Kardashians themselves — Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and mother and manager Kris Jenner — who transformed from Southern California socialites to moguls who helped pioneer a cottage industry of social media influencers. Through the years, the cast included Kris’s ex, Caitlyn Jenner, who chronicled her journey as a transgender woman in one of the show’s many spinoffs, and Rob Kardashian, whose mental health struggles also became a plotline.

“People would be naive not to pay attention to this show. It was Shakespearean,” said Ryan Bailey, host of the reality TV podcast “So Bad It’s Good.” Business mastermind Kris Jenner, he noted, “at times sacrificed her family’s well-being and family’s sanity. But in doing so, she built an empire.”

That empire now dominates in the form of billion-dollar-valued companies, such as Kylie Cosmetics and Kim’s KKW beauty brands. And Kendall’s career as a supermodel for high-end designers. And the multiple fashion lines, apps and lifestyle websites. And the rabid interest in the entire photogenic brood’s lives, broadcast to their 900 million collective Instagram followers, and as seen in a host of glossy magazines and tabloid sites. (See: The Internet-breaking news in January that Kim and her superstar husband, Kanye West, planned to file for divorce.)

And yet, the most critical chapter in their dynasty — the one that launched them into the stratosphere — is winding down. How did they get to this level and manage to stay there? What does the future hold? And what does the end of “Kardashians” mean if they never really go away?

Some celebrities try to avoid scandals. To the Kardashians, they’re like oxygen. It seems like the moment one ends, another surfaces and ensures their names stay in the news.

Controversy was attached to the Kardashian name long before their current ubiquity: Kris’s ex-husband, the late Robert Kardashian, was one of O.J. Simpson’s close friends and attorneys during his murder trial in 1995. In the early 2000s, Kim rose to fame after a sex tape with her boyfriend at the time, R&B star Ray J, was released on the Internet. Both situations convinced TV producers this crew could carry the drama necessary for a reality show.

They have remained in the spotlight ever since, with the drama spilling over from “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” into headlines following the family that keeps multiplying with partners and children. No matter the situation, no backlash has ever been enough to bring them down. From the dubious Kardashian Kard (a credit card that the Connecticut attorney general said marketed “a dangerous financial fantasy”) to Kim shilling for “appetite suppressant” lollipops to multimillionaire Kylie asking her fans to donate to a makeup artist’s GoFundMe for medical bills, the list of outrages is long and consistent.

“Scandal has always been a part of them — getting written about in the press and getting attention is what matters,” said Erin A. Meyers, an Oakland University professor and author of “Extraordinarily Ordinary: Us Weekly and the Rise of Reality Television Celebrity.” “We expect controversy to be part of their image … their constant presence means there always has to be something new.”

They have also managed to sidestep issues that could bring down any other celebrity, including a well-documented past of cultural appropriation. Writer Sylvia Obell vividly remembers the extreme reaction to her viral 2016 piece for BuzzFeed about the rise of reality TV star Blac Chyna — and chronicled how satisfying it was to watch a Black woman upend the Kardashians’ carefully controlled narrative after she started dating Rob and announced she was pregnant with his baby. It was also a searing analysis of the Kardashian-Jenner dynasty and how the sisters were often praised as trendsetters any time they ripped off Black culture: wearing their hair in cornrows and calling them “boxer braids,” enhancing their lips, showcasing their famous backsides. They also had a reputation for “stealing” Black men who were already dating other women.

“I saw a lot of Black women on my timeline who were very excited about Blac Chyna being pregnant by Rob Kardashian, but not really understanding why,” said Obell, co-host of the “Okay, Now Listen” podcast. “I knew why: Because it had been so long built-up, feeling robbed of our culture by these women who built their success on the backs and literal butts of Black women.” (Chyna has ongoing lawsuits pending against several members of the family, including for defamation and interference with prospective earnings over her spinoff’s cancellation.)

The Kardashians rarely address these frequent critiques head-on, though Kim has made a publicized push toward criminal justice reform in her current quest to become a lawyer, citing the responsibilities of raising four Black children. “I never knew much about the system until I started to dig in,” she told CR Fashion Book in an interview last year. “Once I learned and saw how many things were wrong, I really couldn’t stop.”

But the criticism remains a part of the Kardashian legacy, particularly among the younger generation. Isabel Molina-Guzmán, a professor of Latina/Latino studies at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the family is typically the first pop culture example students in her classes bring up when they discuss cultural appropriation.

“Blackness and Black aesthetics have been identified as cool and hip, even as Black people have been discriminated against. My students really responded to Kim’s cornrows as another example of that,” Molina-Guzman said. “They were ubiquitous — and you can’t avoid the Kardashians.”

Much of the critique aimed at the Kardashians over the years has been valid. Some has also been misogynistic, which is no surprise given that their show centered on women who talked candidly about their relationships, children, bodies and sex lives. A common complaint was that the sisters were just “famous for being famous” and didn’t actually do anything.

However, if you share those feelings with anyone born between the years 1996 and 2012 — known as Gen Z — that would just make you sound … well, really old. While they may not have the same attachment to the Kardashian family as millennials who grew up watching the show, many in Gen Z respect the family’s business savvy.

“For people who are younger, they see the Kardashians as social media stars,” said Brittany Hennessy, author of “Influencer: Building Your Brand in the Age of Social Media.” As opposed to dismissing them as drama-filled reality TV personalities, they recognize them as moguls who own lucrative fashion and beauty companies. “They just have a completely different reference point to what the Kardashian family actually contributes to society.”

Maddie Bregman, the 22-year-old founder of youth marketing firm GirlZ, agreed. Although she knows a couple of friends who are “obsessed” with the Kardashians, most of her peers treat the family with indifference, or occasional mild interest if they’re in the headlines.

“I would say Kim is interesting just because of who she is and what she’s going through with Kanye right now. And Kanye West is one of the most relevant people for this generation as well — Kanye and Kylie Jenner,” Bregman explained. “So sort of by default, a lot of people are paying attention to Kim.”

“From a purely business perspective, I think they’re awesome,” she continued. “Personally, I don’t really care that much about them. Which I think is not necessarily unique to me and them, but a generational thing with celebrities where we feel way more of a connection with the influencer kind of people who are posting on TikTok and becoming famous off of YouTube.”

These days, TikTok parodies of the Kardashians can garner even more interest than videos about the real-life family. Yuri Godinez, also known as TikTok influencer @yurilamasbella, plays the roles of Kim and Kourtney to an unnervingly accurate degree in several Kardashian parodies, which rack up a huge number of views.

“It’s a pretty comical show to me,” Godinez said. Her TikToks poke fun at Kardashian tropes that fans easily recognize: the endless shaking of salads, long pauses while Kim is distracted by her iPhone, “arguments” over things that would not matter to anyone but the supremely privileged. “I feel like they’re just so disconnected from actual reality now.”

And while some TikTok users may not get the jokes, they can still appreciate the Kardashians’ overall impact. “In my generation’s eyes, they’re iconic cultural shapers,” said Connor Blakley, a 21-year-old entrepreneur. “Kris Jenner is a genius.”

Nearly everyone interviewed for this story echoed a variation of the line you can see any given day floating around social media: “The devil works hard, but Kris Jenner works harder.”

Jenner, the matriarch, is credited as the architect behind her children’s successes — the one who engineered the reality show deal with executive producer Ryan Seacrest in the first place and launched her kids on paths so successful they would far outpace a TV series. (Eventually, “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” essentially became an hour-long commercial for their various products.) And even though the show now averages fewer than a million viewers an episode — nowhere near its peak of nearly 5 million for the Season 4 finale when Kourtney gave birth to her first baby — it probably could have kept going. But Jenner has said in interviews that it’s clear social media is the future. They also recently signed a deal to produce “global content” for Hulu.

So that’s where the Kardashians will be after their longtime reality show ends: still all over the place, with millions of followers eager for updates. But their place in TV history will loom large. Farjam, the show’s executive producer, can’t count the number of times that other producers breathlessly said they found the “next Kardashians.” They haven’t.

“They were lightning in a bottle,” Farjam said, remaining open books about their entire lives while still appearing relatable to fans. “No matter how famous they get, they’re still people, they still have feelings, they still have regular problems,” she said. “And because they have each other … they’re able to overcome a lot, which I feel like is inspiring and an important message.”

Obell said one overlooked aspect of the Kardashians’ connection to viewers is their vulnerability in opening up about so many deeply personal, often fraught topics. “We were here for the mess, and they shared the mess with us,” she said. “I’m curious to know how much they regret or don’t.”

Either way, it’s hard to imagine the past 15 years without the family and all the questions and arguments they inadvertently sparked about fame, money, race, politics, parenting, marriage and everything in between. No matter where they go from here, it will probably be impossible to ever stop talking about them.",0
123,"Proof spring is soup season, too: This bright bowl packed with peas, leeks, spinach and herbs","This recipe is spring in a bowl — joyful, green, fresh, bright and warm. It’s made with early-harvest vegetables — leeks, peas, new potatoes, spinach and herbs — and is simply seasoned so their delicate flavors come through clearly. The leeks and potatoes are simmered until tender in chicken or vegetable broth, but the rest of the vegetables and herbs are added shortly before serving so they cook just long enough to yield to the warmth of the broth but still remain fresh and bright.

Story continues below advertisement

Feel free to vary the vegetables based on what you have on hand, swapping onion for the leeks, parsnips or carrots for the potato, or using snow peas, baby kale, and basil for the green vegetables and herbs, for example.

This recipe has such a garden-to-plate vibe, I think of it as the soup version of a salad and I serve it that way, alongside a sandwich or omelet, or before a main course. Each spoonful is a delightful reminder that spring, like other times of year, is also soup season.

Storage notes: Leftover soup can be refrigerated for up to three days. The spinach and herbs will lose their vibrant color, but the soup will still taste delicious.

Story continues below advertisement

Ingredients

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 large leek, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced into half-moons (about 3 cups)

12 ounces waxy potatoes, such as new potatoes or creamers, peeled and diced into 1/2-inch pieces

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste

1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

6 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth

2 cups (10 ounces) sweet green peas, fresh or frozen (if frozen, do not defrost)

2 cups packed fresh baby spinach leaves

1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley

2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh dill

Step 1

In a soup pot over medium heat, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Stir in the potatoes, salt and pepper. Add the broth and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the potatoes are tender, about 8 minutes.

Step 2

Stir in the peas and continue to simmer until they turn bright green and just tender, 2 to 5 minutes. Add the spinach and cook until just wilted but still bright green, 30 seconds. Stir in the herbs, then ladle into bowls and serve hot.

124,A pernil-style pork tenderloin that conjures the smells of a Puerto Rican kitchen,"Sometimes it’s a few bars of a Héctor Lavoe song or the sight of a pile of large, bright green avocados that remind me of the island half of my family calls home. But, most often, it’s scent that jogs the images out of the dusty corners of my brain.

Story continues below advertisement

The peppery, slightly bitter smell of red-orange achiote oil. The earthy green of fresh cilantro or its bolder cousin, culantro. The buttery syrup dripping from a ripe mango; the dizzying slap of strong vinegar; the musky sweetness of fried green plantains; the deep, rich, garlicky smell of roasted pork.

I don’t eat nearly as much meat these days as I did when I was a kid, but the smell of pernil, Puerto Rican-style roasted pork, will always take me back to my grandmother’s kitchen. Heady with garlic and a blend of spices and herbs, pernil is a process, and while it’s very much worth the effort, I don’t always have the energy to make it. That’s how this Pernil-Style Pork Tenderloin with Mojo Potatoes and Coconut Creamed Spinach was born.

Advertisement

Story continues below advertisement

One day, while craving those flavors, I picked up a pork tenderloin. After rubbing it with a simple adobo of garlic, lime juice and spices, I roasted it in a hot oven until it was just cooked through, but still juicy and tender. Later, while flipping through Von Diaz’s 2018 cookbook, “Coconuts & Collards: Recipes and Stories from Puerto Rico to the Deep South,” I saw that she’d come up with a similar idea. Great minds, right?!

I added chili powder to my adobo, and a bit more garlic and lime than Diaz uses, but that’s the thing about pernil: Cooks make it their own. I’ve seen recipes include cumin, paprika, onions, pineapple, coconut milk, achiote or cilantro; other Puerto Ricans might disagree, but I’d say garlic is the only real constant. This recipe would be nice sliced, in fat sandwiches, but I suggest here a side of boiled potatoes in mojo sauce and coconutty sauteed spinach. It’s the kind of meat + starch + vegetable dish I grew up eating, but a bit more streamlined, and a touch less rich, too.

Pork tenderloin is an especially quick-cooking and lean cut of meat, but if you don’t eat pork you could use lamb, beef, white fish filets or a whole chicken here instead, adjusting the cooking time accordingly. If you don’t eat meat, rub the adobo over halved portobellos or canned, drained jackfruit and then roast until they start to crisp. The mojo potatoes are inspired by yuca con mojo, a traditional Puerto Rican dish using boiled cassava root or yuca; feel free to use yuca instead of the potatoes, or even roasted squash, boiled yams or steamed cauliflower. The other side here is coconut creamed spinach, which is really just quickly sauteed baby spinach with garlic and coconut cream. Feel free to use any chopped dark, leafy greens in place of the spinach, and if you don’t have or don’t want to use the coconut cream, you can omit it.

This isn’t a one-dish recipe, as you can see, but it’s written with efficiency in mind. You quickly marinate the pork — though you can let it marinate overnight if you’d like — and roast it while boiling the potatoes and making the mojo sauce. Let the pork rest, to preserve its juices, while you drain the potatoes and mix them with the sauce, and then make the spinach — it takes only a few minutes! — before slicing the pork and serving.

Ingredients

For the pork tenderloin

3/4 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon chili powder

1/2 teaspoon dried oregano

2 cloves garlic, minced or finely grated

1 teaspoon olive oil

Juice of 1/2 lemon or lime (about 1 tablespoon)

1 (1-pound) pork tenderloin

For the mojo potatoes

2 or 3 medium (about 1 pound) russet potatoes, peeled and quartered

Kosher salt

2 tablespoons olive oil

1/4 small onion (any kind), thinly sliced

1 clove garlic, thinly sliced

2 tablespoons fresh lemon or lime juice (from 1 lemon or lime)

Pinch finely ground black pepper

Small handful torn fresh cilantro leaves and tender stems, for garnish (optional)

For the coconut creamed spinach

1/2 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil

5 ounces (about 5 cups) baby spinach

Pinch kosher salt

1/4 cup unsweetened coconut cream or milk

1/4 teaspoon finely grated orange zest, plus more for garnish

Pinch finely ground black pepper

Pinch ground nutmeg, preferably freshly grated (optional)

Step 1

Make the pork tenderloin: In a large zip-top bag or bowl, make the adobo by combining the salt, chili powder, oregano, garlic, olive oil and lemon juice.

Story continues below advertisement

Step 2

Pat the pork tenderloin dry, then cut 5 or 6 small, shallow slits into it with the tip of a knife — this will help the meat absorb the spices — and place it in the bag with the adobo. Massage the adobo into the meat until well coated on all sides. If you’d like, you can let the meat marinate in the refrigerator overnight or up to 1 day in advance.

Step 3

When you’re ready to roast the pork, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 400 degrees. Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, place the tenderloin in the center of the baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. Using tongs or a fork, flip the tenderloin and roast for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until it reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees; the exact roasting time will depend on the thickness of the meat. Let it rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Story continues below advertisement

Step 4

Make the mojo potatoes: While the pork cooks, in a large pot over high heat, bring potatoes and a large pinch of salt to a boil in enough water to cover. Cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Tip the pot into the sink and drain out almost all of the water, leaving a few tablespoons in with the potatoes. Return the pot to the stove, off heat, but cover and keep warm.

Advertisement

Step 5

Make the mojo while the potatoes cook: In a small skillet over medium-high, heat the olive oil until it shimmers. Add the onion, garlic and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, just until the onion and garlic turn translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lemon juice and black pepper. Set aside until the potatoes are cooked.

Story continues below advertisement

Step 6

Pour the mojo sauce over the hot potatoes. Cover and keep warm until ready to serve. Serve garnished with cilantro, if using.

Step 7

Make the coconut creamed spinach: In a large skillet over medium, heat the coconut oil until it melts. Add the spinach and let it begin to wilt. Add the salt, and let the spinach cook down, release its liquid and mostly dry out, about 5 minutes. Stir in the coconut cream or milk, orange zest, pepper and nutmeg, if using, and simmer until the coconut cream reduces slightly and thickens, 3 to 5 minutes. Serve warm, with a bit more orange zest on top.

126,Florida governor sues the CDC to get cruises sailing immediately,"The lawsuit against the Biden administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls the agency’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and asks the court to “set aside the CDC’s unlawful actions and hold that cruises should be allowed to operate with reasonable safety protocols.”

Story continues below advertisement

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during Thursday’s news briefing that she didn’t have a direct response to the lawsuit.

Advertisement

“But I will just reiterate that the CDC guidance is based on data and health and medical guidelines,” she said. The CDC declined to comment on the move.

The lawsuit comes amid mounting tension between the cruise industry and the CDC, which last week rolled out additional safety instructions for cruise lines, even if passengers are vaccinated. A trade group on Monday called the new requirements “unduly burdensome” and “largely unworkable” and doubled down on its request to sail again by early July.

Earlier this week, the agency said it was committed to working with the industry to start cruising following a phased approach it laid out in a conditional sailing order late last year.

“This goal aligns with the desire for resumption of passenger operations in the United States expressed by many major cruise ship operators and travelers, hopefully by midsummer,” the agency said.

Story continues below advertisement

Several operators have announced in recent weeks that they will start to base ships in other countries — including the Bahamas, Bermuda, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Greece — because they still don’t have permission to depart from the United States.

“If we do not do this, you will see cruises continue to move these cruises to other countries,” Florida’s attorney general, Ashley Moody, said at the news conference. “The Biden administration has had numerous opportunities to engage and put America’s businesses first, Florida’s businesses first. And instead he has allowed the playing field to be tilted to the benefit of foreign countries, and Florida will not allow that to happen.”

While the world’s largest cruise operators are headquartered in South Florida, they are all incorporated overseas, and almost all of their ships fly the flags of other countries.

Florida is home to the world’s busiest ports, which see millions of cruise passengers in a normal year. Last year, ports in Fort Lauderdale and Miami became the last resort for ships that had been turned away by other countries during a scramble to return all cruise vessels to land.

Some of those ships had passengers on board who were sick or died of the coronavirus. At the time, DeSantis initially said he did not want passengers from those ships to be “dumped into South Florida.” He also acknowledged at the time that cruise ships, some of which suffered major outbreaks, had taken up a lot of government resources.

On Thursday, he pointed out that much had changed in the past year, thanks to the widespread availability of vaccines, testing and more effective treatments.

Most cruise lines that have announced plans to restart have said they will either require all crew and passengers or all adult passengers to be fully vaccinated, either sailing from the United States or other countries. The CDC is recommending that crew and passengers be vaccinated but is not requiring it.

DeSantis and other speakers Thursday repeatedly touted the country’s vaccination progress and said the CDC should have already take that into account when deciding when cruise ships can sail. The governor said that companies didn’t need the agency to enforce certain protocols and that they understand what moves they need to take to make their customers comfortable.

But he also suggested one key component of a cruise comeback — companies’ own vaccine requirements — would be off limits in Florida. DeSantis signed an executive order last week that prohibited businesses from requiring proof of vaccination, the Associated Press reported.

“You can go to a restaurant, you can get on a cruise ship, you can go to a movie theater without the company demanding that you show them your health information,” he said Thursday. “It’s just not necessary to do.”

He said people who were concerned about infection should get vaccinated.

“But it is a choice, and it’s not something that I want to restrict people based on whether they’ve got the” vaccine, he said.",0
127,Why your next rental car might cost more than a plane ticket,"Back then, the prices for an SUV or van were a little higher than his $700 budget for the 10-day trip with his family of five. Now, he’s finding options closer to $1,600.

Fore is not an outlier in his struggle. As millions more Americans get vaccinated against the coronavirus every week — and millions take to the skies — demand for travel is skyrocketing.

That growing interest is running smack into a dearth of vehicles after rental car companies shed hundreds of thousands of their cars during the earlier days of the pandemic. And in many cases, the cars that are available are extremely expensive.

“Essentially this is really just kind of an extreme example of supply and demand,” said Chris Woronka, a leisure analyst at Deutsche Bank who follows rental car companies.

It is an unusual starring role for rental cars, which typically don’t command that much of a traveler’s attention — or budget.

“People would book their airfare and they would book their hotel and then they’d book their car rental whenever they got around to it,” said Jonathan Weinberg, founder and CEO of car rental site AutoSlash. “If you do that, you’re going to be left standing when the music stops.”

The problem has been especially prevalent this spring in warm-weather destinations including Florida, Texas, California, Arizona, Hawaii and Puerto Rico, experts say. Social media posts reveal fruitless searches, exorbitant prices and photos of long lines of people waiting for vehicles.

Representatives for Hertz Corp. and Avis Budget Group did not respond to questions, but a spokeswoman for Enterprise Holdings said in a statement that the company is seeing upticks in bookings in the spring and summer.

“We anticipate this continuing throughout the coming months, especially in pockets of the country popular with travelers,” spokeswoman Lisa Martini said in the statement. She added that vehicle supply is a challenge because of a global shortage of semiconductor chips that is holding up auto production.

“We are working closely with our manufacturing partners to continue to add vehicles to our fleet to meet the demand,” Martini said. “We also are leveraging our large network of neighborhood and airport locations to move vehicles where possible to support regional spikes in demand.”

Woronka said moving vehicles around is expensive and time-consuming for the rental car companies, and the chip shortage is making it difficult to rebuild fleets economically. He said there are still unknowns about how the situation will eventually be resolved, but he doesn’t expect a very quick fix.

“I am not overly optimistic that we are going to have all the rental cars we need for peak summer travel season,” he said.

Weinberg said he expects to start seeing shortages in other areas as summer approaches, especially near national parks. In those cases, he said, it might be necessary to rent a car farther from the attraction and bake a longer-than-planned road trip into the vacation.

He said he has already heard stories of people who have canceled entire trips because they couldn’t get a car.

“I think that folks are saying, 'It’s great that I got this $50 airfare, but the rental car is going to cost me 10 times as much,” he said.

Jake Ekhaml, an accountant from St. Paul, Minn., thought he and a friend would have a “super cheap last-minute trip” to go fishing in Panama City Beach, Fla. They had a free place to stay and decided to book an inexpensive flight to New Orleans and then rent a car and drive to the Florida beach town on Saturday.

Ekhaml’s friend thought he found a car for $400 or $500 but wasn’t able to confirm the rental. Ekhaml finally found one and booked it — he thinks — for about $750.

“If we get there and we don’t get a car, we’ll just stay in New Orleans,” he said.

Even for non-beach destinations, George Quinn, 50, of Hallandale Beach, Fla., said he’s noticed a pattern: In three trips he’s booked since last fall — to Dallas, Philadelphia and Cincinnati — the cost of a car for three or four days has been more than the plane ticket. Shortly before the Cincinnati trip this week, he saw that the price for a car had jumped from $207 to more than $375.

Quinn said he always uses a site that compares prices across multiple companies, and then goes to their websites directly to check. His advice: “Book early and just keep checking. You can always cancel without any kind of penalty and rebook.”

Weinberg recommends that people make speculative bookings: If they’re not sure exactly when they want to go on vacation, they should search in the area they plan to visit and book rentals for multiple dates. Especially in a scenario like this, “pay later” rates instead of prepaid bookings will allow for the flexibility to cancel without a penalty.

While Weinberg hesitates to suggest making several reservations on the same date, he said if someone knows they will absolutely need a car — and worries that one won’t be available when they arrive — it might not hurt to have a backup reservation.

His company has also found that sometimes companies that don’t show availability for a weekend rental will have cars to rent for a longer period of time. So he recommends expanding a search to include more days in case that reveals more options. In “most cases,” he said, car rental companies will offer a credit if customers return the vehicle early.

Chris Fore, the California high school principal taking his family to Hawaii this summer, got some suggestions after he tweeted about his plight. Someone shared a photo of a friend who had rented a U-Haul truck in Hawaii to get around.

“I’m not going to do that,” Fore said. “But we are just looking at some other options.”

One of them: Turo, a car-sharing company that lets owners rent out their vehicles.

The company has seen its business increase as the demand for cars intensifies.",0
128,Americans are hitting the road to get vaccinated,"One year into the pandemic, Americans are focused on travel precautions, vaccine passports and securing vaccination appointments. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released new travel guidelines saying it is safe for fully vaccinated people to travel domestically, the paradox is that some unvaccinated Americans are traveling during the pandemic to get a vaccination.

Story continues below advertisement

According to a recent study by West Health Policy Center, which focuses on seniors’ health care, and the University of Pittsburgh School of Pharmacy, vaccination distribution and availability across the country varies widely. There are some counties in which 100 percent of the population lives more than 10 miles from a vaccination facility, and others with fewer than one facility per 10,000 residents.

“Some 9 million Americans live further than 10 miles from the closest vaccine administration site. Requiring even one person to travel outside of their community to access the vaccine is a burden but asking this of millions of Americans is its own public health emergency,” Sean Dickson, director of health policy at the West Health Policy Center, said in an email.

No one seems to be officially tracking how far Americans are traveling for shots. Doug Ward, a Colorado Springs resident and founder of VaccineHunter.org, said by email that, anecdotally, he estimates about 40 to 50 percent of people are finding vaccine appointments within 30 minutes of their homes. Others are not so lucky scoring a nearby option and are making day trips or longer drives for their vaccinations. “Out of 10 members of my family, five did two- or four-hour round trips for vaccines,” said Rachael Dzaiba, a high school junior who co-founded the Illinois Vaccine Hunters Facebook group.

Many states are reporting that nonresidents are receiving vaccinations; in Pennsylvania as of press time, over 139,000 of the more than 2 million people fully vaccinated in all counties were out-of-staters.

So, I’m clearly not alone in choosing to travel for a vaccine rather than wait longer locally.

“There is an immediate sense of relief, knowing you have taken that step,” said Inger Burnett-Zeigler, 40, a clinical psychologist and associate professor in the department of psychiatry at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. “I think the option to go get the vaccine is providing people with hope and optimism about being able to return to some normality.”

But, she added, traveling is not an option available to everyone. “For folks in under-resourced areas, the idea of going elsewhere is out of reach.”

Challenging immunization efforts across the U.S. has led local and state officials to improvise strategies on how coronavirus vaccine doses are distributed. (Luis Velarde/The Washington Post)

Lou Grossman was willing and able to hit the road. The 69-year-old Sarasota, Fla., resident and his wife, Amy, 63, both partners in Grossman Public Relations Counselors, spent a total of seven hours driving to and from West Palm Beach, Fla., for their vaccinations.

Story continues below advertisement

After doing the trip in one day for the first shot, they decided to take it easier for the second dose. They stayed overnight in a hotel, and enjoyed dining outside, taking a walk on a local beach, window shopping and visiting friends in Palm Beach. “We had a relaxing two days,” he said. “I feel relieved.”

Though she only drove an hour each way for her own vaccination, Jenny Thompson, 53, CEO and founder of SafetyPIN Technologies, spent more than 11 hours round trip (with a few stops) to drive her 79-year-old mother, Meira Cagan, to and from her second vaccine appointment.

“She was registered on five to six sites and could never get appointments anywhere in Baltimore. I was starting to get nervous,” said Thompson, who is based temporarily in West Orange, N.J. So, she drove down to Baltimore and then to Upper Marlboro, Md., to secure her mother’s shot.

Deborah Dreyfuss-Tuchman, a Chicago resident living part time in Palm Springs, Calif., signed up her family to volunteer for eight hours at a site four hours away in Glendale, Ariz., to get their vaccinations.

Dreyfuss-Tuchman, who is a business development director for a media advertising company in her early 60s, worked registration. Husband Jeremy Tuchman, a long-term-care insurance broker also in his early 60s, picked up trash in a golf cart. And their daughters worked in the hospitality suite. “After the second vaccine, I felt more comfortable, and it was spectacular being able to dine with friends in Arizona,” Dreyfuss-Tuchman said.

Twenty-five-year-old Jake Seaton, a tech start-up founder, said he and two friends took a six-hour, 400-mile overnight trip from D.C., to Florence, S.C., for their first Pfizer shots in hopes of being able to return to a more normal life (and getting a second shot closer to home). “We looked at states where we were eligible this early, and South Carolina was the closest,” he said. “It was fun to go on an adventure on the road with friends.”

Story continues below advertisement

As for myself, after spending at least 30 hours online trying to get a vaccination locally, I Googled a map of Illinois and started typing in cities where an appointment might be available. Peoria, no. Rockford, no. Aurora, no. Springfield, no. Pekin, boom. That’s why, on that rainy Thursday, I set out with my appointment confirmation and prescribed medication for asthma, high blood pressure and high cholesterol — all to prove my eligibility — for the small city of nearly 33,000 people near Peoria.

Central Illinois felt expansive and smooth, but the storm robbed me of the chance to enjoy the views of winter-starved open land and enormous trees primed to turn green. When I stopped in Dwight, Ill., to use the restroom at a gas station/mini-mart, I bought a Diet Coke to be polite to the cheery woman at the cash register. It felt rude to just use the restroom and leave.

After I left Dwight, it took a few tricky turns to reach Pekin and the shiny white CVS Pharmacy where I would get my shot. A nurse named Roz guided me through the quick and orderly process. No one asked to see my prescription bottles. As the shot went into my arm, sincere relief spread throughout my body like a prayer.

Story continues below advertisement

After I waited the requisite post-vaccination time, Roz smiled and said, “See you in three weeks.” She was nice, but I hoped not; I planned to get my second Pfizer dose closer to home. (And I did, in Flossmoor, Ill., about 30 miles away.)

A few miles down the road, I pulled into what looked like a locally owned small-town restaurant called Cobbler Corner, which promised food I probably shouldn’t eat on a regular basis but knew I would enjoy, for my only taste of Pekin. I settled on the combo of onion rings, mozzarella sticks and breaded mushrooms to start. For the main course, I ordered a chicken patty melt with fries, and then I added two cobblers — naturally — to bring to my sons at home.

The combo arrived with a small dish of spaghetti sauce for dipping. An older woman at another table asked how it was. “It’s great,” I told her. She thanked me and smiled and waved at me throughout the meal. I waved back. I had made two friends in Pekin, which is way more than I make in a day working in my home office for 11 hours at a stretch.

Story continues below advertisement

It was still raining when I got back in the car. There was no neon sign to remind me to PAY ATTENTION but I managed to swerve around not one, but two fallen bumpers on my way home, secure in the knowledge that I was already halfway to a safer life.

Targeted Advertising. You may choose whether to receive some forms of targeted advertising from many ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance . Please see the Online Tracking and Advertising section and visit our Ad Choices pages for further information about how to disable cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to certain types of targeted advertising.

Other Choices. The local laws where you live (e.g., laws of the E.U. and California) may permit you to make certain requests. See the section applicable to the place of your residency below.

Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms. Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not take action in response to these signals. We do however respond to the Global Privacy Control signal for California residents, as described further in the Privacy Information for California Residents section. You can also see the Online Tracking & Advertising section for additional information about privacy choices that may be available to you with respect to targeted advertising.

Data Security

We have in place physical, electronic and managerial procedures to protect the information we collect online. However, as effective as these measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

Children’s Privacy. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16 without parental consent, unless permitted by law. If we learn that a child under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it in accordance with applicable law.

Online Tracking & Advertising

How We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies and How To Disable These Technologies

We, our service providers, and third parties that provide content, advertising, or functionality or measure and analyze ad performance on our Services, may use cookies, web beacons, mobile ad identifiers, and similar technologies to facilitate administration and navigation on the Site, to better understand and improve our Services, to determine and/or improve the advertising shown to you here or elsewhere, and to provide you with a customized online experience.

Cookies. Cookies are small files that are placed on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies may be used to store a unique identification number tied to your computer or device so that you can be recognized as the same user across one or more browsing sessions, and across one or more sites. Cookies serve many useful purposes. For example:

Cookies can remember your sign-in credentials so you do not have to enter those credentials each time you visit a Service.

Cookies can help us and third parties understand which parts of our Services are the most popular because they help us see which pages and features visitors access and how much time they spend on the pages. By studying this kind of information, we are better able to adapt our Services and provide you with a better experience.

Cookies help us and third parties understand which ads you have seen so that you don’t receive the same ad each time you access a Service.

Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable browser cookies or flash cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the Services.

Beacons. We, along with third parties, also may use technologies called beacons (or “pixels”) that communicate information from your device to a server. Beacons can be embedded in online content, videos, and emails, and can allow a server to read certain types of information from your device, know when you have viewed particular content or a particular email message, determine the time and date on which you viewed the beacon, and the IP address of your device. We and third parties use beacons for a variety of purposes, including to analyze the use of our Services and (in conjunction with cookies) to provide content and ads that are more relevant to you.

Local Storage & Other Tracking Technologies. We, along with third parties, may use other kinds of technologies, such as Local Shared Objects (also referred to as “Flash cookies”) and HTML5 local storage, in connection with our Services. We also may use unique identifiers associated with your device, such as mobile ad identifiers. These technologies are similar to the cookies discussed above in that they are stored on your device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these technologies may make use of different parts of your device from standard cookies, and so you might not be able to control them using standard browser tools and settings. For HTML5 local storage, the method for disabling HTML5 will vary depending on your browser. For Flash cookies, information about disabling or deleting information contained in Flash cookies can be found here.

Additional Choices With Respect To Targeted Advertising

As described above, we and third parties may use cookies and other tracking technologies to facilitate serving relevant ads to you. For example, these technologies help us determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before, tailor ads to you if you have visited our site before, and avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. You can learn more about certain types of targeted advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices page.

In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies as described above, you may opt-out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance .

Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt-out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.

Please visit our Ad Choices page for additional information and privacy choices.

If you’d ever heard of Odessa, Texas, before this, it’s probably because of one story.

""friday night lights"" clip 1 I expect you boys to execute. ""friday night lights"" clip 2 Yes, sir. ""friday night lights"" clip 3 Expect you boys to play football. ""friday night lights"" clip 4 Yes, sir. [MUSIC] ""friday night lights"" clip 5 Go out of bounds at the 35-yard line! [INAUDIBLE]

annie brown

“Friday Night Lights” was written about a high school football team in Odessa, Texas, in the late ‘80s —

""friday night lights"" clip And that’s a mojo touchdown!

annie brown

— a time when the city was reeling from a huge oil bust, when unemployment rates were soaring. And still, every Friday night, the city would gather to cheer on their winning team, the Permian Panthers.

""friday night lights"" (coach) Clear eyes, full hearts. ""friday night lights"" (players) Can’t lose. ""friday night lights"" (coach) Let’s hear it, gentlemen. Clear eyes, full hearts. ""friday night lights"" (players) Can’t lose. ""friday night lights"" (coach) Let’s go play some football! Let’s go play!

annie brown

In the book, one Odessan tells the author, “Life really wouldn’t be worth living if you didn’t have a high school football team to support.”

""friday night lights"" clip Third down.

annie brown

The town continues to be so in love with the sport that regular adults, not just fanatical parents, have been known to camp out in line, waiting for tickets to the high school game. When life in Odessa is tied to the unsettling ups and downs of oil, football is steady. So perhaps it should come as no surprise that just as Texas was among the first to reopen their classrooms —

archived recording (scott muri) Good evening, and welcome to ECISD Live. My name is Scott Muri, and I’m the superintendent. And it’s a pleasure to welcome each of you this evening. We have a pretty exciting lineup as our main topic tonight is “Friday Night Lights.”

annie brown

— it was also decided that in the middle of the pandemic —

archived recording (scott muri) And what more of an important topic could there be in West Texas right now other than “Friday Night Lights“?

annie brown

— the football season would go on. [MUSIC] From the New York Times, I’m Annie Brown. This is Odessa. With the city’s Covid positivity rate in the double digits, there were obvious risks to resuming a contact sport that draws crowds in the thousands. But for the school district, there wasn’t really a debate.

scott muri We’re seeing some data that is a bit disturbing. The learning is not happening in a way that it should.

annie brown

They had been watching as their remote students in particular grew increasingly isolated and adrift, with students missing the usual points of connection that had kept them tethered to school.

scott muri The motivator is a teacher in the building, or it is the social interaction that they have in the building, or is the extracurricular that they engage with in the building. And for some of those kids that are at risk, that doesn’t exist.

annie brown

So even before it was clear that Texas would allow high school football to continue, the district began prepping for a season. And the superintendent was hopeful —

scott muri We know, statistically, that students that participate in extracurriculars, whether it’s athletics, or the band, or cheerleading, et cetera, they do better academically.

annie brown

— that reopening football could help with what was becoming a crisis of motivation in the city’s already struggling schools.

scott muri And so anything that we could do to positively keep our kids engaged in the learning process, we’re going to do. archived recording [CHEERING]

annie brown

So the question was, could bringing back something so essential to the city’s identity help re-engage students in school?

archived recording [CHEERING]

annie brown

And would whatever benefits it brought outweigh the costs? Today: In part two, the season begins in Odessa. [MUSIC]

annie brown I have a question for you. How important is football to you, Joanna? joanna lopez It’s not important at all to me. [LAUGHS] Like, the sport, it’s not important to me at all. I don’t understand it.

annie brown

The thing about the high school that Joanna Lopez goes to, the high school that we chose to follow — Odessa High — is that it’s not the high school from “Friday Night Lights.” That’s the high school across town. And it turns out that Odessa high’s football team —

joanna lopez Honestly, I’m not going to lie, O.H.S. football kind of — they’re not great.

annie brown

— is very bad.

joanna lopez We never win a football game. archived recording That’s right. Time for a battle over at Ratlif Stadium. Odessa High looking for its first win of the season. joanna lopez So we kind of just go for the entertainment. We know we’re not going to win. archived recording Odessa High back to punt, can’t handle the snap. [WHISTLE] And it would be down at the second quarter. How’s that for a short field? A penalty — O.H.S. with negative 78 rushing yards according to the stats.

annie brown

And so the football team isn’t particularly uplifting for the students at Odessa High.

joanna lopez They’re running, but the football slips. I’m like, how can that happen? You literally have it in your hands. archived recording 1 — beating Odessa 49-0. archived recording 2 45 to 7. archived recording 3 62 to 17. archived recording 4 I was so close. archived recording 5 I was really pulling for them tonight. Man, Odessa High had a halftime lead. We have a few Odessa High Broncos in our newsroom. They were so pumped, but man, [INAUDIBLE]. joanna lopez And it just makes me mad, so I just don’t even watch it at all. archived recording 6 Tough loss for Odessa High right there. [MUSIC]

annie brown

When you’re there, does it feel like the band is kind of, like — how does the band compare to the football team?

joanna lopez Well, the football team kind of doesn’t like us, because we kind of steal their attention. I’ve seen a lot of tweets, or something like that, like, I just go for the band, or I just go for the drum line.

annie brown

What Odessa High does have is a killer marching band, a marching band that may or may not upstage the football team.

joanna lopez Because we get more wins than they do. We have a lot of trophies, more trophies than they do. [LAUGHS] I’m bashing my own school, but it’s OK. archived recording [MUSIC] When it comes to a successful band programs in the basin, there’s one name you can’t leave out, the Odessa High Broncos. And after last night’s UIL competition, they made sure you knew why.

annie brown

Every year the band spends the season preparing for the big regional competition.

archived recording The first band in conference [INAUDIBLE] is the Odessa High School band.

annie brown

And every year —

— for the last 81 years —

annie brown

— they’ve gotten the highest ranking possible.

archived recording Odessa High School, division I. [CHEERING]

annie brown

No other band in Texas has that legacy, not even the Permian Panthers. At the high school with the district’s lowest graduation rate, the highest dropout rate and the poorest performing football team, the marching band is something everyone can be proud of.

archived recording [MUSIC PLAYING]

annie brown

And this year, it’s the only reason that Joanna is showing up at Odessa High School. Remember, back in the spring of 2020, Joanna’s dad lost his job when the oil industry in Odessa got slammed by the economic fallout of the pandemic.

joanna lopez I was hearing that people are losing their jobs. And so I didn’t think it would happen to us, but it did.

annie brown

Joanna had started working at a local smoothie shop to help pay for her car bills and chose to do school remotely, meaning she was calling in to classes from work.

joanna lopez Yeah, sometimes I would forget that I would have school, so I would have to go to the bathroom and try to sign in and everything quick as possible, and then rush back outside to work.

annie brown

Now, six weeks into the school year, Joanna is feeling overwhelmed. She decided to quit her job. But like so many remote students at O.H.S., she’s still falling behind on assignments at school. And yet every morning, Joanna gets up early —

marching band [PLAYING MUSIC] speaker Please have your music out. I know you’re still learning.

annie brown

— and drives to Odessa High School in time for an 8:30 AM practice.

speaker One, two, three, four. Where are we going? [INAUDIBLE] And it’s Monday morning. Where are we going? marching band [INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC]

annie brown

She meets the band on a parking lot on the Southwest corner of campus —

speaker Listen and lock in, snares. Got to listen.

annie brown

— with football yard lines painted over the parking spots.

speaker Four, three, two, one.

annie brown

Because while Joanna chose to be remote for everything else —

joanna lopez Yeah, online school is very, very stressful. But I love band so much.

annie brown

— she couldn’t imagine not returning for band. It’s the only consistent time she sees her friends.

speaker You got to let that football team know you’re out here just like they are.

annie brown

And it’s the only time she interacts in a meaningful way with a teacher in person.

speaker Have them say to each other, God bless, I’ve missed our band. I don’t think they’re saying that right now. joanna lopez Well, Mr. Olague, he’s the coolest person you’ll ever meet. jimmy olague [INAUDIBLE] you’re not scared of anymore. Good for you, sweetheart. joanna lopez He’s really funny — archived recording Diggity-diggity, bop, boom, stop. joanna lopez He jokes around a lot. jimmy olague Thomas knows where it’s at. joanna lopez So he’s kind of made an impact on everybody, especially on me. jimmy olague One, two, three! annie brown Jimmy? jimmy olague Hi, how are you? annie brown Hey, good, we’re doing good. jimmy olague Awesome. Sorry about my hair, I need a haircut, ladies. annie brown You sort of have a faux hawk thing going on. jimmy olague [LAUGHS] Yeah, it looks better when it’s cut right. Yeah.

annie brown

Mr. Olague, or Jimmy, has been teaching on the band for the last 25 years. He runs the part of the team that’s sort of like the beating heart of any marching band —

jimmy olague Like, you got snares going — [SCATTING] And bass drums. [SCATTING] And tenor [SCATTING]

annie brown

— the drum line.

jimmy olague You know, these guys, boy, they put that drum on and they think they’re God’s gift to this earth.

annie brown

Unlike other teachers this year who are struggling to get to know their students over Google Hangouts with patchy connections, Jimmy has known his drum line for years.

thomas chavez Thomas Chavez. jimmy olague Thomas Chavez. thomas chavez And I’m known for doing stupid stuff. jimmy olague This kid is my clown.

annie brown

Often he’s been helping them get ready for the drum line since middle school.

zachary bode My name is Zachary. jimmy olague Zachary Bode is my senior. zachary bode I’m known for being the one that’s always messing around. jimmy olague When he speaks, he speaks so darn loud. speaker Yeah, I know, I heard him. jimmy olague So we’re always going, Zach, why are you yelling, man, why are you yelling. And, oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t know [INAUDIBLE]. Zach, any idea where Braulio’s (sp) at?

annie brown

He knows their families and their back stories —

jimmy olague John Alex is very soft spoken, very quiet young man. john alex I’m known as the shy guy in the band, basically.

annie brown

— their vulnerabilities, and what they need to get better.

jimmy olague When he plays, he looks down a lot. So I’m always on him to get his head up, to look out at the crowd, and so forth. We were all excited a couple of years ago when he finally got a girlfriend. We were like, oh my gosh, yay, good for you. You know, hopefully that’ll open you up, and get you talking more, and so forth. john alex I’m a man of few words.

annie brown

Jimmy sees band as a way to show kids what they’re capable of, even when the rest of life is hard.

jimmy olague I want them to learn how to work hard and continue striving and pushing themselves so that they could have a better life than what maybe they have now.

annie brown

And his students can feel it. This year, while half of the students at Odessa High School chose not to come back in person, and nearly a third of the band took the season off, every single member of the drum line decided to return to the band in person.

student 1 I just I really enjoy the family that we have made here. student 2 We spend a lot of time together, and mostly everyone’s your family. [chatter] jimmy olague It’s time to go home, And man. I’m tired of seeing these kids. Put your stuff up, please, and stand.

annie brown

These were the kinds of connections the district was hoping to maintain when it brought back extracurriculars.

jimmy olague We met with our school, and our administrators were like, look, can you figure out something to do so that the kids are still participating, and also have a little something to present at a football game?

annie brown

But the plan they came up with was a shell of a typical season. There would be no regional competition to look forward to, No division I trophy to claim. All that was left were the halftime performances at the football games. And as a Covid precaution, it was decided that the band would only play at the home games.

jimmy olague So that’s when we knew, OK, looking at our schedule, wow, we only have four home games. annie brown Why is that worth the risk? Like, with only four games to prepare for and to play at, why is it worth having the marching band at all? jimmy olague Well, we still have a job to do. There’s a lot of kids here who really love this. Some of them really need this. We knew we had to keep them involved, and we wanted to plan something to work towards. I mean, some of these kids, this is all they have. [MUSIC] joanna lopez So I have never had friends growing up. Girls were mean to me in elementary. Everybody had their own groups, and I was just kind of by myself.

annie brown

When Joanna was 13 or 14, she would ride along with her older brother on that same early morning drive she now takes to that same parking lot on the Southwest corner of campus with the yard lines painted over parking spots.

joanna lopez My brother was in band, and so I would go to the rehearsals in the mornings, because I didn’t have a ride because my parents would have to go to work. And so he would take me with him. And it would be 7:00 in the morning, and I was still half asleep sitting outside and just watching them, you know, goof around and just have a good time. And I guess just the whole environment was just — I just wanted to be in that type of environment where your friends are basically your family. And that’s what I kind of saw.

annie brown

So when she got to O.H.S. as a freshman, and she was determined to be on the drum line, it didn’t actually have that much to do with the music.

joanna lopez I’m not sure if I’m allowed to say this because I don’t know if Olague’s going to hear this, but I don’t really know how to read music. [LAUGHS] I kind of just look at the music and I have an idea. And then once I start playing it, I kind of just get a feeling on how it’s supposed to sound like.

annie brown

Which is maybe why her audition for the bass drum didn’t go as she hoped.

joanna lopez I remember hitting some notes, but most of the notes I kind of missed. And so that’s when I was like, I blew it, so I’m not going to make it. So that’s when I missed even more notes, and yeah. jimmy olague I remember, yeah, she didn’t make it. So she was very concerned and disappointed. She wanted to be on one of those drum positions.

annie brown

But there was one position on the drum line that year that didn’t require auditioning: the cymbals. And Jimmy encouraged Joanna to go for it.

joanna lopez Well I wanted to cry, because I was embarrassed. No, I thought it was a bad instrument. You know, it’s kind of embarrassing to be in cymbals.

annie brown

But he nudged her towards thinking about it differently. ^JIMMY OLAGUE^: I left my office open. I said, all right, here’s my computer. Scan all these YouTube videos, find different cymbal lines, see what you like, see what you see.

archived recording [CYMBAL LINES] jimmy olague I said, and let’s learn those visuals. You know, let’s borrow from these groups. joanna lopez I never thought you can flip them and do all these crazy tricks with them. archived recording [BAND PLAYING] jimmy olague And sure enough, they had a list of different videos that they saw that they enjoyed. And so they were showing me. I said, OK, so did you understand what they’re doing? What kind of — I believe that move is called this, let’s look this up. archived recording The start of this visual will have you initiate movement from your right shoulder and elbow just as if you were —

annie brown

And over time, Joanna totally embraced it.

joanna lopez It’s all in the wrists. And so you kind of usually hit yourself, so you pinch yourself, and so you get a lot of bruises. But it’s worth it. jimmy olague They became the flash and the color of the drum line. joanna lopez I just fell in love with cymbals.

annie brown

And she found her spot on the band.

joanna lopez My first year in drum line, when it was our first drum line get-together, I guess I had the group chat on mute because it would get pretty annoying. They’d start blowing up. And so I got a private message from Mario, and he was just texting me like, hey, are you coming to the party, we’re all going, and you’re not answering. So we are just all wondering if you’re going. So that kind of made me, you know — it felt great to finally feel like people actually want me there. jimmy olague So the next year, it was time for auditions, and I said, Joanna, what are you going to try out on. She says, I want to stick on cymbals, I want to stay on cymbals. I’m like, OK. So that, in turn, has become — you know, this is the third year now — it’s what they have been doing. So guess what, Joanna? You’ve just made something that’s going to become tradition for us. joanna lopez So it taught me a lot, not just about music and band, just about life. And Olague’s been really good about that. He’s given me a lot of life lessons and yeah. annie brown What do you think he taught you? joanna lopez He taught me about self — self-worth. Is that how you say it? annie brown Yeah. joanna lopez Yeah. [MUSIC]

annie brown

I’ve thought a lot about this version of Joanna that Jimmy described who, after not making her audition, re-imagined a role for herself and carved out a whole new space on the band. In the conversations I’ve been having with her this year, I didn’t really recognize that person.

band playing

annie brown

Band wasn’t just the only time Joanna went to school. It was one of the only things she left the house for, one of the only things she got dressed for, one of the only things she looked forward to.

band playing

annie brown

And it wasn’t clear that these four games would be able to carry all the weight of years past.

jimmy olague That first row, guys. Get your hands up. I need to hear the drum.

annie brown

It was the end of September, just a week before their first game of the season. And they had only been practicing for a couple of weeks.

band playing speaker Yeah, that baritone is still late for some of you.

annie brown

But this did not sound like an award-winning band.

jimmy olague I can’t believe that you can’t hear and play in time, buddy. I don’t understand.

annie brown

The freshmen had no idea what they were doing, the trumpets were dragging, the drum line was rushing.

drum line joanna lopez I’m very nervous, yeah. I think we’re all stressing. drum line

annie brown

Indeed, that whole week leading up to the first game Jimmy seems very stressed.

jimmy olague You know why you missed it? Because you were out of step. I told you. I don’t know how to tell you how — that you need to get this learned. I’m yelling at him because I know that they’re not giving me their all, that they’re not trying their best, that they’re just going through the motions. That’s what I’m focusing on. If they perform well, it’s going to make them feel better. And when we’re together, we only have a certain amount of time to get it there. And when they start not giving us their best, that’s when I get really irritable. band playing jimmy olague One note at the end.

annie brown

But the drum line still wasn’t ready. So a special practice was called just for the drum line the night before the first game.

joanna lopez

What’s this song called? The one we’re playing?

speaker Oh, “Lose My Breath?”

joanna lopez

“Lose My Breath.”

jimmy olague Who made this song popular? speaker You? jimmy olague No. This is from an actual song. Ever heard of a female singer named Beyonce? OK, she was in a group before she was Beyonce. What was the name of that group? students Destiny’s Child. jimmy olague Joanna, say it louder.

joanna lopez

Destiny’s Child. There you go, Destiny’s Child, OK?

annie brown

This is a practice inside the band hall. There are a little over 20 students in the room clustered into their sections, their backpacks lining the front wall behind Jimmy. The kids are instructed to wear their masks while playing, but some forget to. Some pull them off to drink water and forget to put them back on. Jimmy throws his off briefly at one point in a fit of frustration with it.

jimmy olague I hate these frickin’ masks.

annie brown

But as they start to practice, the kids fall into their rhythm together.

band playing

annie brown

They giggle, they flirt, they talk incessantly until the very moment they have to start playing.

band playing jimmy olague It’s like you have music in front of you, but you’re not reading it. Do you have it upside down, or what? Did you flip it inside out? You’re not that good.

annie brown

And as the night goes on —

annie brown

— they get better.

annie brown

Just yards away from where these students are practicing, the lights are off in the classroom of Naomi Fuentes, the college prep teacher we’ve been following, whose first few weeks of school have consisted of a small handful of students sitting quietly in front of her, with others signing in remotely from their bedrooms or their jobs. What’s happening here, this is what she’s been missing.

drum line jimmy olague Today went so much better. We were able to stop and actually clean now. OK, let’s work on this section because it’s not sounding very good yet. So we got to spend time to clean certain sections of versus. All right, go to the next move. Go to the next move. And it’s gotten a lot better. Thank you for your time. Pick everything up. Don’t leave anything here. Yes, sir. [INAUDIBLE] tomorrow morning.

Back at home that night after practice, Joanna is still buzzing.

annie brown How do you feel about the fact that tomorrow is the first game? joanna lopez I’m excited. I’m ready for it. I don’t want the night to end.

annie brown

As excited as she is for the game, she seems almost equally excited about this very particular thing that’s going to happen at the game.

joanna lopez There’s this one tradition that we have. We actually hide gummy worms, sour gummy worms, in our hats.

annie brown

It’s a tradition where the drum line hides sour gummy worms in their costumes. And then, right before their big halftime show, they each put a gummy worm in their mouths, only they’re not allowed to chew it the whole time they’re playing.

joanna lopez We had to go through the whole show without eating it. [LAUGHS] And so after the show, it’s all soggy and kind of just in these small pieces. annie brown You have to be there, I guess. joanna lopez And so I’m very excited for that part. [LAUGHS]

annie brown

These are the kind of details we heard from so many kids when they described what they had been missing about school this year. They had almost nothing to do with actual school. One girl got a new haircut and picked out an outfit for the first day of school only to realize that none of her girlfriends were there to see her. One senior told us that what she really had been looking forward to senior year was going off campus for lunch. And when that was canceled due to Covid, she decided just to stay home. The things that keep kids excited about school, and once they’re there learning, were so sorely absent this year. But because the band was still on, it still offered a little of that.

annie brown OK, good luck. joanna lopez Thank you. annie brown We can’t wait to hear it. joanna lopez Bye.

annie brown

The next day, Joanna got some news.

archived recording Ratliff Stadium in Odessa will be empty tonight. If you were headed out for Odessa High’s game, we have some bad news. The game against Lubbock Monterey is canceled, and that’s after a Bronchos football player tested positive for Covid-19.

annie brown

Game one of four canceled due to Covid.

joanna lopez No actually, people might call me dramatic. But I kind of did tear up, mainly because I thought about — we already don’t have much of a marching season, our competitions. I was just thinking of how much has been taken away from us. And then yet another thing. I was very excited, so — annie brown I’m so sorry about that, Joanna. joanna lopez Yeah, I was sad because we actually bought the gummy worms for later in the game. And so we had already bought everything, so —

annie brown

When Joanna heard the news that the first football game had been canceled, and with it, their first performance, she was driving home from an interview for a new job at Best Buy.

joanna lopez Well, at the smoothie shop, I would get paid $8.50. And so Best Buy, they start you off at $15 an hour. So if I get good hours, I would make pretty good paychecks.

annie brown

Her family’s financial situation had improved. But not by much.

joanna lopez My dad, he was trying to get his unemployment. But he had a lot of trouble with it.

annie brown

And when he did settle into a job, it paid a little more than half of what he’d been making in the oil fields. So Joanna was hoping that she’d be able to manage a job at Best Buy better with school than she had at the smoothie place. But it wasn’t that her grades had improved.

joanna lopez Well, my grades aren’t looking good right now. My mom got in the mail today. And I got in trouble. But — annie brown What do you mean she got in the mail today? What did she get? joanna lopez One of my teachers sent out my grades. So he kind of told on me. But that’s OK. [LAUGHS]

annie brown

Joanna told us that her plan had originally been to go to a four-year college and study psychology. The plan was always a bit of a dream. She wasn’t great at school. And money had been tight before. But those things had never been more true than they were this year. And now, she was finding it difficult to even imagine.

joanna lopez I feel like I haven’t learned anything in school. And I feel like it would be hard for me to go into something that I don’t really have an idea what’s going on. And so I kind of just want to have an easy path and study cosmetology. That’s always been my plan B. So I feel like that’s kind of turning into my plan A.

annie brown

Over the last few months, we’ve checked in with Joanna’s guidance counselor and the college counselor responsible for seniors. And they both agreed that social isolation, financial stress and a lack of motivation have left many seniors struggling to hang on and uncertain about their futures. The college counselor estimated that only about half as many students have applied to college this year as in previous years.

joanna lopez Well, I guess I kind of started looking at the reality of how hard it is to get into good colleges and how expensive it is. That’s another thing. I know I wouldn’t be able to pay for my college all by myself. And I would need help from my parents. And I don’t want to ask that from them because they’re already struggling enough. annie brown Last year, do you think that you would have thought maybe they could help me? joanna lopez Yes, I did think that. [LAUGHS]

annie brown

It was always asking a lot of marching band to make up for so many of the stresses of this year, especially a marching season whose ambitions had been shrunk down to just four games and now, three. And then, just four days after that first game was canceled, Jimmy gave us some more news. Something had just happened at an early morning practice.

annie brown Hey, we’re all here. jimmy olague Good morning, ladies. annie brown Tell us what happened. jimmy olague Well, we were adding some different choreography to the show just to spice it up and so forth. And we’re rehearsing right now. In fact, I’m sitting in the truck looking at them go through different sets with music and so forth. And so yeah, I mean we were in the middle of rehearsal. I don’t know if I can hear the band playing in front of me. annie brown No, we can’t hear. jimmy olague OK. annie brown Can you hold up your phone? jimmy olague Yeah, I will roll down the window a little bit.

annie brown

They had been in the middle of working on something when a school police car drove into their parking lot practice field.

jimmy olague So when I turn around, I see that it’s the ECISD police. And she quickly grabs my attention and waves me to her car. So I said, yes ma’am. And she says, the nurse is trying to get ahold of you guys. Y’all need to call the nurse. I’m like, OK, so quickly, mentally, you’re like, all right. I think I know what this is about. And then you’re like, damn it.

annie brown

And what he feared was correct.

jimmy olague We had a student who tested positive for Covid in the band and was in rehearsal last week.

annie brown

At this point, there had been a couple of dozen positive cases among the students and staff at the school. But as far as Jimmy knew, this was the first positive test on the band, a band of 160 kids.

jimmy olague And then she asked me questions. Do you think this person has been in close quarters or close in spacing? And I said, no. Our drill writer wrote six feet or more for each kid so every time we move, they’re keeping a safe distance. annie brown Do the kids know anything about what just happened? jimmy olague No, they don’t know anything. annie brown And so what happens next? jimmy olague Now, we release them. If they are going to school on campus today, then they go to the main building, to the band hall, put up their stuff, and get ready for their second period class. And if they’re going home, then they wait for their parents or whoever’s picking them up to take them home. Some of these kids drive on their own. Now, you’re just crossing your fingers hoping that it’s just this one person and not a group in the band. annie brown So you don’t know who exactly this band member who has tested positive has been in contact with, but — jimmy olague No. annie brown — still kids are going to class? I’m just wondering with that in mind, why not just tell the whole band, do remote school for the next two weeks? jimmy olague For the next two weeks? Yeah, well, I mean, that’s the thing. If they do remote school, then they wouldn’t be able to come to rehearsal as well. So I understand your question. annie brown Yeah. jimmy olague But the nurse has or will contact these kids being exposed. They’ll go ahead and them home or whatever and do what they need to be doing. annie brown Right. Thank you, Jimmy. Good luck. jimmy olague You’re very welcome. Thank you. All right, ladies. Y’all have a great day. annie brown All right. jimmy olague OK. annie brown Bye-bye. jimmy olague All right. annie brown Bye.

annie brown

We reached out to the nurses who said that they had followed their protocol, the protocol that they had been trained on. What we didn’t know when we talked to Jimmy was that that training consisted of a three-hour online course on contact tracing, and that there were just two nurses responsible for contact tracing for around 4,000 students and 300 staff at Odessa High School. But following that protocol, in this case, the nurses determined that no one else on the band had been exposed. Practices could continue. And the future games were still on.

speaker Welcome, Bronchos! [CHEERING]

annie brown

Which is how, finally, three weeks later, on a crisp October Friday, the Odessa High Bronchos marching band had their first game day.

speaker [INAUDIBLE] of the year. Let’s go! [CHEERING] Now, let’s hear from our Broncho band. Here we go. [CHEERING]

annie brown

In the morning, there was a pep rally where the band played the fight song to a mostly empty audience. The guests of honor, the football team, sat on the field in chairs spaced six feet apart —

speaker (SINGING) Oh say, can you see —

annie brown

— while someone sang the national anthem. The showgirls danced their routine, and the football coach gave some final notes of pleading encouragement.

speaker Good morning. We just ask that you show up tonight, you be loud, dress warm. Let’s go kick some bulldog butt. [CHEERING]

annie brown

And with that, the pep rally was over, and the students went about their normal Covid school day. As the afternoon rolled around, band members signed out of their Google Classrooms, put on their uniforms, and piled into buses to drive to Ratliff Stadium for the game. This was the same stadium Friday Night Lights was filmed in, where that night, the Odessa High Bronchos would play the Midland Bulldogs. The game had started by the time the band arrived. And they made their way into the stadium and took their spot in the stands at the 20-yard line. They set themselves up to play songs to cheer on the football team as they played. Everyone was excited when Odessa High made the first touchdown of the night —

announcer Bronchos 6, Bulldogs 0.

annie brown

A 20-yard run into the end zone by the quarterback.

announcer [INAUDIBLE] end zone for the Bulldogs touchdown.

annie brown

But the Bulldogs caught up quickly. And by the end of the first half —

speaker Well, we’re losing. [LAUGHS]

annie brown

It wasn’t looking good.

announcer Bulldogs, 14. Bronchos, six.

annie brown

And then it was time for what the band had been preparing for — their very first marching performance at halftime.

speaker Pass the gummy worms, bro.

annie brown

But first, as tradition called for —

speaker Don’t bite it. Don’t chew it. Just [INAUDIBLE]. Keep it in your mouth the entire game.

annie brown

They each got a gummy worm to hold in their mouth —

speaker There’s really no purpose, but I don’t know. It’s fun. [LAUGHS]

annie brown

— then took to the field.

announcer Ladies and gentlemen. the Ector County Independent School District and Odessa High School are proud to present the award-winning Odessa High School Broncho Marching Band.

annie brown

Jimmy is on the 45-yard line, facing the band, watching as they get into position.

jimmy olague They start moving their first movement. And we were like, OK, everybody remember to move. Nobody stood still, so thank God. So far so good. The drum line starts sounding good. OK, they’re together. And the band’s sounding really good. They’re playing nice and loud. And then the soloists start coming up and start playing. And they’re getting a good crowd response after each soloist. So I’m like, OK. They’re doing it. They’re doing what we’ve been working on. Seeing the drum line move to their formations and then line up in the middle of the field. And I’m like, OK, they’re about to move up forward, which means here comes the drum break. So that’s when I get excited because that’s my baby right there. So the snare drums do their little thing and play. And then the bass drums do their thing and play. And while that’s happening, the cymbals are back there doing twirls and visuals and so forth. When you’re down there in front of it, right there in the middle, and it’s just hitting your face, you’re like, oh this is — life is good right now on Friday night in Odessa, Texas. was a lot of good things, man. I’m proud of you. Good job. It’s great to play for people [INAUDIBLE]

annie brown

As they left the field and headed back to their seats, Jimmy was there to meet them.

jimmy olague And they did great, did great. For the first one, it’s really neat. They had a great response, man. That’s what we’ve been waiting for, for them. So they feel good.

annie brown

From there, the rest of the game went as they often do.

announcer And stop. They just scored. Keep an eye on the [INAUDIBLE]

annie brown

The other team scored again and again.

speaker It looks like we’re going to lose this one.

annie brown

The Bronchos lost.

speaker It’s the spirit that counts. That’s all that matters. announcer [INAUDIBLE] tonight’s game. On behalf the city of Odessa —

annie brown

And for one brief moment, life at Odessa High School felt normal. Next time on Odessa, behind that sense of normalcy, the school nurses who have been responsible for contact tracing are feeling very overwhelmed and find themselves facing the largest quarantine of the semester, which just happened to be on the band.

michael barbaro

Here’s what else you need know today.

archived recording (president joe biden) Good evening, my fellow Americans. Tonight, I’d like to talk to you about where we are as we mark one year since everything stopped because of this pandemic.

michael barbaro

During a televised address to the nation, President Joe Biden directed governors to make all adults eligible to receive the coronavirus vaccine by May 1.

archived recording (president joe biden) Let me be clear. That doesn’t mean everyone is going to have that shot immediately. But it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot.

michael barbaro

In the speech, delivered shortly after Biden signed the Stimulus Bill into law, the president said that life in the United States could return to a form of normalcy by the 4th of July.

archived recording (president joe biden) After this long, hard year, that will make this Independence Day something truly special, where we not only mark our independence as a nation but we begin to our independence from this virus.

150,"Opinion | Mars, a Robotic Arm, and the Most Important Question of Our Time","archived recording (SINGING) When you walk in the room, do you have sway?

kara swisher

I’m Kara Swisher, and you’re listening to “Sway.” Well, actually, at this very moment, you’re listening to the first audio recording of Mars. We have that thanks to NASA’s Perseverance rover, which is stationed on Mars, along with the helicopter called Ingenuity. In just a few days, the helicopter might become the first aircraft to take flight in the atmosphere of another planet. But the primary objective of the mission is much bigger than just capturing strange sounds or breaking intergalactic flight records. The ultimate goal is to answer the question, has there ever been life on the red planet? On the show today, I’m talking to one of the people who is bringing us closer to that answer: Diana Trujillo. She’s an aerospace engineer at NASA and a flight director of the Perseverance rover in charge of its robotic arm. And in February, when the Rover landed on Mars, Trujillo hosted NASA’s first ever Spanish-language broadcast of a planetary landing.

archived recording (diana trujillo) — estamos de recibir. Hemos llegado! Perseverance llegó. Hemos llegado con cuidado — archived recording Touchdown confirmed. Perseverance safely on the surface of Mars.

kara swisher

Welcome to “Sway,” Diana.

diana trujillo

Hi. Thank you so much for having me.

kara swisher

I should say Lady Diana. That’s your actual name, correct?

diana trujillo

That’s correct. Actually, it’s Lady Diana.

kara swisher

You have to explain the story. I think it’s wonderful.

diana trujillo

Well, the reason why my name is Lady Diana is because my grandmother, actually, and my mother had picked it. I was born around the time that Lady Diana actually got married. And my grandmother and my mom always expected for me something wonderful to happen. So I think that they named me after her, hoping that things will go better for me. And I feel like it was that girl thing where you’re like, oh, hopefully, she’s going to find the man of her dreams, which turned out to be different because I’m less of a Lady Diana and more of a Princess Warrior-type thing. I mean, I love my husband, but my entire — my mom, my grandma, my great-grandma’s life was all around serving the other person, particularly your partner. And it’s almost like, stay on the sidelines. And so, I felt like if that was what was in store for me, baby, that was not what I wanted. I wanted to do more.

kara swisher

So I want to talk about your personal story of how you got to NASA and why you wanted to become an aerospace engineer.

diana trujillo

O.K., so the way that I got to NASA, it’s an interesting story because I wasn’t supposed to be working at NASA. I came from Colombia when I was 17. I came to the U.S. I didn’t have, really, any money to survive. And I didn’t know any English.

kara swisher

Why did you come?

diana trujillo

There were several things. One of them is, at some point, my family was having an internal family reunion on the opposite direction. So they were divorcing. And at the same time, I am trying to figure out what am I going to do with my life. And my dad actually had an idea of you should try to learn another language if you want to go somewhere else. So I came to the U.S. And then very quickly, I just found myself trying to study English for two years, which I could not handle anymore at some point. I started to go to the math department, just hoping to see if anybody needs any help because I want to do something else that is not English. And I took a class when I was about to finish my English classes. That was astronomy. And this is in Miami Dade Community College. In that class, I remember the teacher very vividly saying, I have a friend who’s an astronaut. And I thought, I can’t believe that there’s somebody that I know that’s standing in front of me that knows an astronaut. And from then on, I decided, let me read about it. What do people actually do, and what their careers are, and then aerospace engineering was the thing. From the practical standpoint, that’s kind of how I found aerospace engineering. But from the personal standpoint, at some point, it was a crossroad in my mind, where — with my family, it was hard from the perspective of what was the expectation for a woman and what women should be doing. And so, it was more of a, I got to pick something that’s hard, something that speaks for itself and I don’t have to explain, “You do realize that women are smart, right?”

kara swisher

So did you have interest in space when you were growing up?

diana trujillo

For me, space had a very romantic idea. Space was the thing that I will go and lay down on the grass and look at the sky and be like, everything is chaotic around me right now, but space is awesome. The sky is awesome. The stars are awesome. No stars are crashing with each other. And I like to say, is like, nothing is happening on the night sky. But everything is happening. The planets are out there. The stars are out there. And everything just is this amazing harmony.

kara swisher

Mm-hmm. So you went to NASA Academy. I had never heard of it. Explain what NASA — how did you get into NASA Academy? What is it? It feels like a movie.

diana trujillo

I know.

kara swisher

Like space students or something. Talk about your experience there and how you got there.

diana trujillo

So the NASA Academy is and, at that time, was also a program where a lot of students apply. And they only pick 20 students that go to Goddard Space Center. And when I was about to graduate from University of Florida, one of my professors sent me this link, say, “Hey, apply here.” And so, I apply and I remember I opened the application. And the application was petrifying. It was so many questions. And every question was, “In no less than 300 words...” Which I was like, O.K., I’m used to going in the other direction, which is, “Don’t tell me too much.” And so for me, English as a second language, when the answer is no less than 300 words, I’m like, O.K., this is not happening. So I filled it out, and then I did not send it. And so I showed my computer to my friend. And he’s like, click. It’s like, what did you just do? He’s like, “Oh, no, I just sent your application.” And I’m like, “No!”

kara swisher

Oh, he submitted for you. Wow. Why did you think you didn’t belong? Why did you think you shouldn’t push that application?

diana trujillo

That’s a good question. I think that I felt like I didn’t belong because you normally have a conversation with somebody about like, “Hey, so what school do you come from?” It’s like, “I’m at M.I.T.” “I’m at Harvard.” “I’m at Purdue.” And they’re like, “What about you?” It’s like, oh, I went to community college to do English, and I’m doing aerospace engineer at University of Florida, which is a good school, but it was crazy going in from the perspective that it’s like — this is your biggest shot of your life. Like, the girl that didn’t know any English now is in an internship at NASA with the most brilliant college students.

kara swisher

So through that, you got a job at NASA.

diana trujillo

Yeah, through that, I got a job at the educational office at Goddard Space Flight Center. And then from there, I had the possibility of actually working for a company that at that instant was called Orbital Sciences Corporation. And then from there, I jumped at JPL, so Jet Propulsion Laboratory here in Pasadena.

kara swisher

Explain what the Jet Propulsion Laboratory does.

diana trujillo

Yeah, so NASA JPL is one of the many NASA centers that we have on the states. And really, JPL is known for a lot of things. But one of the things they are known for the most is our interplanetary exploration missions.

kara swisher

Now Perseverance isn’t your first mission to Mars, right? You worked on Curiosity.

diana trujillo

I did. I worked on Curiosity. As soon as I started to work at JPL, I worked for, soon, the Constellation Program, which was to take humans to the moon and Mars. And then I switched to Curiosity.

kara swisher

And why is that?

diana trujillo

So when I was at the NASA Academy, I remember reading about this mission called MSL — Mars Science Laboratory. And they also had this laser-beam eye instrument called ChemCam. And so I remember my group project in NASA Academy, I picked the ChemCam as the — this is the instrument we should take. And so now, fast-forward, I’m working at NASA JPL. And I’m like, wait, on the other side of where I’m sitting on my cubicle is the people that work on the thing that I — in college — was dying to know more about. So the way that I end up working is I remember I went to the Entry, Descent, and Landing Lead at that point, who was the supervisor literally behind my cubicle. And I’m like, “Listen, I know you don’t know me. But give me a job. I’ll do anything, anything you want. I’ll take the trash can out every day if you want.”

kara swisher

Why did that interest you? The idea of putting these machines essentially on Mars to do things?

diana trujillo

This mission, not only it sounds like a comic book, right? Like laser-beam eye, nuclear-power robot. Who does not want to work on that? And so I think that, to me, was more of a, why would you not want to be part of this? Why would you not want to be part of the thing that’s going to start answering the pieces, the building blocks, of, are we alone?

kara swisher

So why is the answer on Mars?

diana trujillo

We know that there was water on Mars. We know it has a very thin atmosphere. We know from Curiosity that actually had the chemical composition to sustain life. So all the answers are like, check, check, check. Now, we got to ask, was there life?

kara swisher

So tell me about how you prepared for Perseverance trip to Mars. And what exactly did you need to do to get that answer?

diana trujillo

So when I joined Perseverance, I was a deputy phase lead for the S.C.S. system, which is the Sample and Caching System. What that meant was I was the responsible system engineer for the robotic arm — the two instruments that go on the turret of the arm. So a way to picture is literally like your arm — shoulder, elbow, wrist. And then, in your hand, two instruments. So two fingers of your hand — just put it that way — PIXL, SHERLOC. SHERLOC is one finger. And then, PIXL is the other finger. And so my job — which I loved, like, I have not had so much fun in a job like that — was to get the robotic arm and those two instruments through the clean room into the rocket. So the clean room is where we assembled the rover. And we keep it — just like the name — clean right before we send it to the Cape. The robotic arm shows up into the clean room. The team that works in the clean room mechanically mounts the arm, and then electrically also connects it. And then, now, it’s like, all right, you guys — which is now the robotic arm science team — make sure that one, we know we mechanically did it right and electrically too. But your job is to make sure that you can actually command it and show that that is performing properly after we made that ginormous move.

kara swisher

So what are you looking for exactly for this arm to do?

diana trujillo

The way that this actually works is that you got the robotic arm with the two instruments. The job of those two instruments is to do a scan of the surface to actually understand the signature of what they’re looking at, and then get a better understanding of what’s the composition of the areas that they’re looking. With that information, the scientists will then go ahead and say, O.K., here’s where it’s looking more like we can find what we’re after. Once the scientists identify that zone, then the robotic arm on the actual hand — which is a turret — has a drill. The drill itself is the one that picks up the sample, puts it on the tube. We process those tubes. And that’s when we cache it.

kara swisher

So you are the one that goes and gets what the scientists need. And the samples can lead us to the answers you were talking about, of life on Mars or what had happened to life on Mars. So what was the feeling among you and your colleagues leading up to this going off?

diana trujillo

My team’s job is like full-on adrenaline. I feel like if I was a NASCAR driver, it would be like, I’m NASCAR-driving for two years straight. Like, I’m not getting out of the car. [LAUGHTER] And so when we — we were here. We did all the testing. Everything was packed. And the Rover goes to the Cape. This is in March. The pandemic has escalated. Everybody — we’re going into lockdown. People go to home. And I’m thinking, like, what do you mean? My team is on the airplane. So I’m recalling all my team. And on that Thursday, and Friday, Saturday, we are like, how are we going to do this? First time ever doing the remote activities with the robotic arm in the middle of the pandemic. Everybody’s on the phone call. We can’t see — but we did it. We did the final check-up. We were able to electrically integrate PIXL and then do the actual motions that we needed to do.

kara swisher

Wow. I can’t believe it went off. Did you ever worry that it might not work?

diana trujillo

You know, no. That never crosses my mind. But my biggest relief was on Saturday, March 21, 2020. I’m on the phone call with my Robotic Arm System Engineer, Doug Klein. He’s there. And he’s like, O.K., launch lock completed. Arm launch lock done. And we’re ready. Anything else can go wrong. But we’re done. We can just throw the mic and leave. And we just did the first unstow of the arm on the surface of Mars, almost —

kara swisher

A year later.

diana trujillo

Almost a year.

kara swisher

Yeah, it landed on February 18, 2021. So now that you successfully landed, and your arm is deployed — which is no big deal. I mean, it was probably harder to put this podcast together — you’re on Mars-time. Explain what Mars-time is. I can hardly understand the difference between — you’re in Los Angeles right now, but you’re actually live on Mars-time. What is that?

diana trujillo

Yeah. So what that means is that we try to time exactly the instances where the spacecraft looks a specific downlink times on Mars. So the long-story short here is it’s all based on when the data hits the ground — which is the instance where our day starts, where we say, O.K., talk to us. We hear you. We can now do all the analysis. And that’s when the day starts. So because we don’t have 24 hours on Mars — we have 24 hours and a little bit more- - we started tracking that decisional path as the day moves. And the decisional path also moves with the orbiter. So we’re just shifting our schedule. For example, last week, we started the schedule at midnight. So we were working from midnight until 10:00 A.M. And then, we do that until — like this week, we’re about to do it starting at 3:00 A.M. instead of at midnight. And so we started walking throughout the clock.

kara swisher

Talk me through what you’re doing every day.

diana trujillo

I have the blessing and the pleasure to be one of the flight directors for surface. And so what that means is when we’re doing downlink, I am the tactic responsible lead to make sure that all the folks that are doing the analysis of every single part of the spacecraft — one, that we’re looking at the right angles of that data. That anything that looks strange we’re digging in. That we’re making sure that everything that we analyze is telling us that the rover is O.K. or is not. If the rover weren’t O.K., and we happen to have an anomaly, then it will be my team in concordance now with project management and the anomaly response team to work out the problem and figure out how we’re going to recover the spacecraft. But we’ve been doing so well. We’re not there.

kara swisher

So right now, it’s in the — is it the Jezero Crater?

diana trujillo

Yeah. So right now, we landed on the Jezero Crater. It’s a delta. So if you look at the pictures — and it looks like a fan. And it’s really cool. Because if you were to put water on it, you could just picture like, oh, here goes the river, and then fans out. And on the fanning out, you can see all the little canals that are created as it’s actually fanning out. And so it forces you to imagine what it could have been.

kara swisher

So what have you found so far? It’s been moving yet? Or is it still where it landed?

diana trujillo

We’re on the move. We are driving — so I believe our last drive was approximately 26 meters. One of the many amazing things that this mission has is a helicopter. For the first time, we’re going to fly on another planet. And so we’re on the move right now to try to figure out — take pictures. And in the meantime, while you’re driving, can you also go ahead and check the drill? Check all the systems that we need to cache the sample. And then, also, do some extra science with the instruments that you have already checked out.

kara swisher

And then, have you picked up any samples? When does that start?

diana trujillo

We will be able to talk about that more — maybe in a few months is when we will get down to maybe even attempt to do something like that for sample. But the thing about the sample is that we first need to pick the perfect place. And that will be the scientist to tell us where to go. Right now, we’re doing checkouts.

kara swisher

Right. And then, when you get those samples, when you drill and you pull them up, can they be studied right there?

diana trujillo

Yeah. So once we actually collect the sample, and we put it in a caching tube, the next mission is the one that actually comes and gets it. We don’t come back. We’re just doing the science on-site. And so the next mission, which is a Mars Sample Return, once it lands, it has a fetch rover that goes down and look for the tubes that Perseverance cached, picks them up. And on the platform of the rocket on the same thing that it landed, takes off and brings them back to Earth. So the estimation is probably 2031 is when they think that the sample will be coming back. But right now, we’re just focused on the new baby of the family which is Perseverance.

kara swisher

So let’s say everything goes according to plan. And we can definitely say that there’s life. They bring back the samples. That’s a huge deal. But then what? I mean, how does that change my life or anyone’s life here on the planet to know if there was life on Mars? What do we do with that knowledge?

diana trujillo

What you’re getting at, in my opinion, is, why do we explore? And I think that we explore for many, many different reasons. There’s people like me who feel the drive and the personal need to understand how things work. That’s one aspect. The other aspect is understanding and exploring other planets, particularly Mars, can help us understand what happened to Mars. So we can take care of our own planet in a much better way. And then, understanding you were alone in the universe I think is the most basic fundamental question of our entire existence. Why would we not want to answer something like that? We can develop technology, help humanity, understand our place in the universe, all of that by doing space exploration and more.

kara swisher

So without proof yet, you do not think we are alone, correct?

diana trujillo

No. I don’t think we’re alone. [MUSIC PLAYING]

We’ll be back in a minute. If you like this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. You’ll be able to catch up on “Sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with the Head of Space Force, General John Raymond. And you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Diana Trujillo after the break. [MUSIC PLAYING] Space exploration has always been a race between countries. It’s always seen as that. Do you see that escalating or decreasing in the future, the idea that it’s a space race?

diana trujillo

It’s interesting that you say space exploration always looks like a race. I’ve never seen it like a race.

kara swisher

Right. But it had. There was a whole space race, like, we’re going to get to the moon first. We’re going to get to this first. Is that over, that idea that it’s a race?

diana trujillo

I see it as it’s over. It’s true that it started with the race. But that’s something that predates me. So the space exploration that I have been doing and the team that I work with, we don’t have the conversation of, who’s going to get there first? No. That’s not for us. I think that the way that we explore is we’re exploring to understand more and to understand the universe and our place. So I see it more as the idea of, we’re there to observe and learn and respect. And not go there and then dominate.

kara swisher

You know, I just interviewed Space Force General John Raymond recently. And he told me that part of their mission is protect American assets from foreign threats in space. He said, “Space underpins our national defense. It underpins our intelligence capabilities. It underpins scientific exploration.” And added, “There is a significant threat from adversaries.” Are the threats from so-called adversaries something you and NASA consider for your missions or not at all?

diana trujillo

No. I understand that concept. But I am lucky to not have to worry about those things and instead learn.

kara swisher

Right. So NASA, of course, is a federal agency which has been funded by the government and the American people. But you partner with private companies like Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin and Elon Musk’s SpaceX among others. Can you explain how those partnerships work?

diana trujillo

Yeah. So really the way that I see it is, space exploration — it’s already a very hard job. And if we’re trying to push for diversity in ideas — not only within the team, by having diverse teams to look at the same problem from different angles — the same needs to happen with the industry. We are different people, different industries in this specific case, where different companies are good at different areas. The way that we can really push this — if we really want to get humans to Mars and beyond — we got to call everybody up. And then say, bring the best of you, bring the best that you can do, and just join the party. Because one single entity is not going to get it done. One single company is not going to get it done.

kara swisher

And there’s also the financial consideration, because they’re bringing up people for a lot of money and giving you the money. One of the aims of these partnerships is to save agency money and still have resources, correct? They are doing different things that might cost enormous amounts of money.

diana trujillo

Yeah. We do different missions. And so I think that — yeah, the question that you’re asking me is, how does the distribution actually occurs? That will be a question for somebody else. But I can tell you that from my perspective is, if those companies can get the job done, why will we not partner with them?

kara swisher

Yeah. I just wrote a column saying, I do appreciate that they’re doing this. But the idea of two billionaires essentially having so much influence on the industry and on a public agency — I always think it’s the government’s mission to do big ideas like space exploration.

diana trujillo

Yeah. I think — yes, there’s two billionaires trying to actually do this that like rockets. And? Are we going to do more? Are we going to go to space more? Are we going to increase that? Can you then eventually tell me, “Hey, I’m going to take the 5 o’clock shuttle to Mars?” Why would you not want to do that? To me, it doesn’t really matter if there are two billionaires, if there’s five billionaires, if they’re zero billionaires. The question to me is not that. The question to me is how can we actually push this more and not get entangled into the other stuff that do not allow us to continue to progress.

kara swisher

Are you worried about — my worry is that two people have influence that all the people of the Earth should have. We all should make these decisions together, not because we happen to be wealthier than other people. That’s all. Just this idea that this is a thing greater than individuals. It’s about a civilization making a decision together. And I’d rather have you in charge than others. That’s all I have to say. [LAUGHTER] If you get my drift.

diana trujillo

No, no. I totally hear you. But I also know that we can’t do it alone.

kara swisher

Right. So SpaceX just announced the first all-civilian mission, which is slated for late 2021. How do you feel about the idea of civilians in space?

diana trujillo

I think that’s great.

kara swisher

Why is that? Tell me why you think that’s important.

diana trujillo

You know what? I love your question because of how you finished the last one. Which is — you talked about, we should be making these decisions collectively and not just specific people that have the privilege to bring the seat to the table. But how can we make the decisions collectively if we cannot take civilians? We’re also not making it collectively. So I think that opening it up and bringing civilians to space is almost like saying, come and be part of the decision-making by experiencing this yourself and knowing how it is.

kara swisher

So right now, it’s very expensive. The reported seat on the SpaceX Crew Dragon with an eight-night stay on the International Space Station is a whopping $55 million. When is it can become actually affordable versus a lot of rich people wandering around space essentially?

diana trujillo

So I don’t know about the timeline. The only thing that I can tell you is — my husband works for Virgin Orbit. He’s the V.P. of special projects. And we have this conversation of when is it going to be. And so I think that what gives me encouragement is the possibility was not on the radar. And now, it’s on the radar. And we’re continuing to work to make it less and less expensive once there is more market.

kara swisher

Are you worried about the effect of space tourism when it comes to issues like space debris and fighting or anything else humans can manage to do up there? You said you were lying on the ground looking up there, and it’s so simple there and so complex here on Earth.

diana trujillo

Yes. Am I concerned about humans doing that? Do we have the track record of taking care of Earth? Not really. But do I think that we deep in our hearts don’t care about what’s happening? Not really. So I think that it’s a balance. I can’t answer that question because I think that all of that is hanging on the answer of the question that Perseverance is trying to answer, which is, are we alone? I think that right now, there’s many, many reasons why we need more resources. And different people see resources differently, and achieve them differently, or get them without asking. But there is also the other aspect of it, which is — I believe that there will be a turning point when we find out that we’re not alone in the universe. And at that point, we can start seeing things more peacefully instead of, more, it’s there for the taking.

kara swisher

So do you think we should live on Mars or think about a multi-planetary experience? Or another planet that would be amenable to us? Or like Jeff Bezos’s thing in the sky that floats around? His spaceship in the sky with trees?

diana trujillo

I think there’s two questions there. Should we do it? And I would say, if we can, more to you. If you want to do that, that’s great. It’s not for me to say what you should do. But should we move on and go for a multi-planetary species? Because we can’t live on Earth because Earth is all damaged or whatever. I don’t believe that. We don’t just destroy and keep moving. We take care of it. And so I think that the reason why we should move on to Mars is just more for the exploration aspect and not because we’re done with Earth.

kara swisher

Will you be going to Mars one day? Do you want to travel in the cosmos?

diana trujillo

I would like to. Yes.

kara swisher

Would you like to live there?

diana trujillo

No.

kara swisher

No. You want to come back?

diana trujillo

I want to come back.

kara swisher

So how are you going to get there? You’ve sent an arm. You’ve sent fingers. You’ve sent mechanical everything. How are you going to — this blob of cells going to get there? I don’t mean to call you a blob. But we all are blobs of cells.

diana trujillo

No, yeah. My personal plan right now is I actually want to go the NASA route. And you know my relationship with applications. So you know why I haven’t applied yet — [LAUGHTER]

kara swisher

Yes, yes, yes, yes. I’ll push the button. Submit. Oh, sorry. Bye. See you later.

diana trujillo

Yes.

151,Amazon Workers Vote Down Union Drive at Alabama Warehouse,"“We just feel like we can do it without the union,” he said. “Why pay the union to do what we can do ourselves?”

Pro-union Amazon workers said they were dispirited by the outcome. “Of course we’re going to be disappointed and angry about the way this election turned out,’’ Emmet Ashford, a worker in the Bessemer warehouse, said at a news conference organized by the union.

He and other workers said they hoped the election result would be overturned because of Amazon’s anti-union tactics and added that they were proud of inspiring workers at other warehouses to consider unionizing.

“Our time will come around again,’’ Mr. Ashford said.

The vote could lead to a rethinking of strategy inside the labor movement.

For years, union organizers have tried to leverage growing concerns about low-wage workers to break into Amazon. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had organized around critical themes of supporting Black essential workers in the pandemic. The union estimated that 85 percent of the workers at the Bessemer warehouse were Black.

The inability to organize the warehouse also follows decades of unsuccessful and costly attempts to form unions at Walmart, the only American company that employs more people than Amazon. The repeated failures at two huge companies may push labor organizers to focus more on backing national policies, such as a higher federal minimum wage, than unionizing individual workplaces.

Democrats in Washington, who put their full weight behind the union effort, said the loss showed that they needed to push for changes to labor and antitrust laws. The House of Representatives passed an expansion of worker protections this year, but it is unlikely to be approved in the Senate.",0
152,Union Loss May Bring New Phase of Campaign Against Amazon,"The lopsided vote against a union at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., was a major disappointment to organized labor, which regards the fight with Amazon as central to labor’s survival. Yet the defeat doesn’t mark the end of the campaign against Amazon so much as a shift in strategy.

In interviews, labor leaders said they would step up their informal efforts to highlight and resist the company’s business and labor practices rather than seek elections at individual job sites, as in Bessemer. The approach includes everything from walkouts and protests to public relations campaigns that draw attention to Amazon’s leverage over its customers and competitors.

“We’re focused on building a new type of labor movement where we don’t rely on the election process to raise standards,” said Jesse Case, secretary-treasurer of a Teamsters local in Iowa that is seeking to rally the state’s Amazon drivers and warehouse workers to pressure the company.

The strategy reflects a paradox of the labor movement: While the Gallup Poll has found that roughly two-thirds of Americans approve of unions — up from half in 2009, a low point — it has rarely been more difficult to unionize a large company.",0

Lee Delaney, the BJ’s Wholesale Club chief executive, dies unexpectedly. Lee Delaney joined BJ’s in 2016 as executive vice president and chief growth officer, and he became chief executive last year. Credit... Gretchen Ertl/Associated Press Lee Delaney, the president and chief executive of BJ’s Wholesale Club, died unexpectedly on Thursday of “presumed natural causes,” according to a statement released Friday by the company. He was 49. “We are shocked and profoundly saddened by the passing of Lee Delaney,” said Christopher J. Baldwin, the company’s executive chairman, said in a statement. “Lee was a brilliant and humble leader who cared deeply for his colleagues, his family and his community.” Mr. Delaney joined BJ’s in 2016 as executive vice president and chief growth officer. He was promoted to president in 2019 and became chief executive last year. Before joining BJ’s, he was a partner in the Boston office of Bain & Company from 1996 to 2016. Mr. Delaney earned a master’s in business administration from Carnegie Mellon University, and attended the University of Massachusetts, where he pursued a double major in computer science and mathematics. Mr. Delaney led the company through the unexpected changes in consumer demand spurred by the pandemic, with many customers stockpiling wholesale goods as they hunkered down at home. “2020 was a remarkable, transformative and challenging year that structurally changed our business for the better,” Mr. Delaney said in the company’s last quarterly earnings report. The BJ’s board appointed Bob Eddy, the chief administrative and financial officer, to serve as the company’s interim chief executive. Mr. Eddy joined the company in 2007 and became the chief financial officer in 2011, adding the job of chief administrative officer in 2018. “Bob partnered closely with Lee and has played an integral role in transforming and growing BJ’s Wholesale Club,” Mr. Baldwin said. He said that the company would announce decisions about its permanent executive leadership in a “reasonably short timeframe.” BJ’s, based in Westborough, Mass., operates 221 clubs and 151 BJ’s Gas locations in 17 states.

A British banking start-up will allow workers to work abroad for up to 2 months a year. Revolut’s office in London in 2018. The banking start-up is offering its workers the opportunity to work abroad for up to two months a year. Credit... Tom Jamieson for The New York Times Before the pandemic, companies used to lure top talent with lavish perks like subsidized massages, Pilates classes and free gourmet meals. Now, the hottest enticement is permission to work not just from home, but from anywhere — even, say, from the French Alps or a Caribbean island. Revolut, a banking start-up based in London, said Thursday that it would allow its more than 2,000 employees to work abroad for up to two months a year in response to requests to visit overseas family for longer periods. “Our employees asked for flexibility, and that’s what we’re giving them as part of our ongoing focus on employee experience and choice,” said Jim MacDougall, Revolut’s vice president of human resources. Georgia Pacquette-Bramble, a communications manager for Revolut, said she was planning to trade the winter in London for Spain or somewhere in the Caribbean. Other colleagues have talked about spending time with family abroad. Revolut has been valued at $5.5 billion, making it one of Europe’s most valuable financial technology firms. It joins a number of companies that will allow more flexible working arrangements to continue after the pandemic ends. JPMorgan Chase, Salesforce, Ford Motor and Target have said they are giving up office space as they expect workers to spend less time in the office, and Spotify has told employees they can work from anywhere. Not all companies, however, are shifting away from the office. Tech companies, including Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple, have added office space in New York over the last year. Amazon told employees it would “return to an office-centric culture as our baseline.” Dr. Dan Wang, an associate professor at Columbia Business School, said he did not expect office-centric companies to lose top talent to companies that allow flexible working, in part because many employees prefer to work from the office. Furthermore, when employees are not in the same space, there are fewer spontaneous interactions, and spontaneity is critical for developing ideas and collaborating, Dr. Wang said. “There is a cost,” he said. “Yes, we can interact via email, via Slack, via Zoom — we’ve all gotten used to that. But part of it is that we’ve lowered our expectations for what social interaction actually entails.” Revolut said it studied tax laws and regulations before introducing its policy, and that each request to work from abroad was subject to an internal review and approval process. But for some companies looking to put a similar policy in place, a hefty tax bill, or at least a complicated tax return, could be a drawback.

The S.E.C. says ‘it may be time to revisit’ the rules on SPACs. After its initial public offering imploded, WeWork went public through a SPAC deal. Credit... Kate Munsch/Reuters After weeks of wading into the debate over how to regulate SPACS, the popular blank-check deals that provide companies a back door to public markets, the Securities and Exchange Commission is sending its first shot across the bow. John Coates, the acting director of the corporate finance division at the S.E.C., issued a lengthy statement on Thursday about how securities laws apply to blank-check firms, the DealBook newsletter reports. “With the unprecedented surge has come unprecedented scrutiny,” Mr. Coates wrote of the recent boom in blank-check deals. In particular, he is interested in a crucial (and controversial) difference between SPACs and traditional initial public offerings: blank-check firms are allowed to publish often-rosy financial forecasts when merging with an acquisition target, while companies going public in an I.P.O. are not. Regulators consider such forecasts too risky for firms as yet untested by the public markets. Investors raise money for SPACs via an I.P.O. of a shell company, and those funds are used within two years to merge with an unspecified company, which then also becomes a publicly traded company. Because the deal is technically a merger, it’s given the same “safe harbor” legal protections for its financial forecasts as a typical M.& A. deal. And that’s why there are flying-taxi companies with little revenue going public via a SPAC while promising billions in sales far in the future. The S.E.C. thinks allowing financial forecasts for these deals might be a problem. They can be “untested, speculative, misleading or even fraudulent,” Mr. Coates wrote. And he concludes his statement by suggesting a major rethink of how the “full panoply” of securities laws applies to SPACs, which could upend the blank-check business model. If the S.E.C. does not treat SPAC deals as the I.P.Os they effectively are, he writes, “potentially problematic forward-looking information may be disseminated without appropriate safeguards.” The letter serves as a warning, but perhaps not much else — yet. Unless the S.E.C. issues new rules (as it did for penny stocks) or Congress passes legislation, SPAC projections will continue. But this strongly worded statement could moderate or even mute them. “The S.E.C. has now put them on notice,” Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant of the agency, said.

Here is how the Amazon unionization vote broke down. Amazon Warehouse Unionization Votes Either side needed 1,521 votes to win. Yes 738 No 1,798 A total of 505 ballots were challenged; 76 were void. · Source: National Labor Relations Board Amazon beat back the unionization drive at its warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., the counting of ballots in the closely watched effort showed on Friday. A total of 738 workers voted “Yes” to unionize and 1,798 voted “No.” There were 76 ballots marked as void and 505 votes were challenged, according to the National Labor Relations Board. The union leading the drive to organize, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said most of the challenges were from Amazon. About 50 percent of the 5,805 eligible voters at the warehouse cast ballots in the election. Either side needed to receive more than 50 percent of all cast ballots to prevail. The ballots were counted in random order in the National Labor Relations Board’s office in Birmingham, Ala., and the process was broadcast via Zoom to more than 200 journalists, lawyers and other observers. The voting was conducted by mail from early February until the end of last month. A handful of workers from the labor board called out the results of each vote — “Yes” for a union or “No” — for nearly four hours on Thursday. Sophia June and Miles McKinley contributed to this report. Karen Weise and

Scammers are selling false and stolen vaccine cards. A screenshot of a “vax cards” page on Facebook. Online stores offering counterfeit or stolen vaccine cards have mushroomed in recent weeks, according to Saoud Khalifah, the founder of FakeSpot, which offers tools to detect fake listings and reviews online. The efforts are far from hidden, with Facebook pages named “vax-cards” and eBay listings with “blank vaccine cards” openly hawking the items, Sheera Frenkel reports for The New York Times. Last week, 45 state attorneys general banded together to call on Twitter, Shopify and eBay to stop the sale of false and stolen vaccine cards. Facebook, Twitter, eBay, Shopify and Etsy said that the sale of fake vaccine cards violated their rules and that they were removing posts that advertised the items. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention introduced the vaccination cards in December, describing them as the “simplest” way to keep track of Covid-19 shots. By January, sales of false vaccine cards started picking up, Mr. Khalifah said. Many people found the cards were easy to forge from samples available online. Authentic cards were also stolen by pharmacists from their workplaces and put up for sale, he said. Many people who bought the cards were opposed to the Covid-19 vaccines, Mr. Khalifah said. In some anti-vaccine groups on Facebook, people have publicly boasted about getting the cards. Other buyers want to use the cards to trick pharmacists into giving them a vaccine, Mr. Khalifah said. Because some of the vaccines are two-shot regimens, people can enter a false date for a first inoculation on the card, which makes it appear as if they need a second dose soon. Some pharmacies and state vaccination sites have prioritized people due for their second shots.

Building values and landlord stock prices are dropping as employers move toward remote work. An empty conference room in New York, which is among the cities with the lowest rate of workers returning to offices. Credit... George Etheredge for The New York Times In only a year, the market value of office towers in Manhattan has plummeted 25 percent, according to city projections released on Wednesday. Across the country, the vacancy rate for office buildings in city centers has steadily climbed over the past year to reach 16.4 percent, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the highest in about a decade. That number could climb further if companies keep giving up office space because of hybrid or fully remote work, Peter Eavis and Matthew Haag report for The New York Times. So far, landlords like Boston Properties and SL Green have not suffered huge financial losses, having survived the past year by collecting rent from tenants locked into long leases — the average contract for office space runs about seven years. But as leases come up for renewal, property owners could be left with scores of empty floors. At the same time, many new office buildings are under construction — 124 million square feet nationwide, or enough for roughly 700,000 workers. Those changes could drive down rents, which were touching new highs before the pandemic. And rents help determine assessments that are the basis for property tax bills. Many big employers have already given notice to the owners of some prestigious buildings that they are leaving when their leases end. JPMorgan Chase, Ford Motor, Salesforce, Target and more are giving up expensive office space and others are considering doing so. The stock prices of the big landlords, which are often structured as real estate investment trusts that pass almost all of their profit to investors, trade well below their previous highs. Shares of Boston Properties, one of the largest office landlords, are down 29 percent from the prepandemic high. SL Green, a major New York landlord, is 26 percent lower.

Biden proposes $1.52 trillion in spending as the White House releases fragments of his first budget. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during a White House appearance on Thursday. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President Biden proposed a vast expansion of federal spending on Friday, calling for a 16 percent increase in domestic programs as he tries to harness the government’s power to reverse what officials called a decade of underinvestment in the nation’s most pressing issues. The proposed $1.52 trillion in spending on discretionary programs would significantly bolster education, health research and fighting climate change. It comes on top of Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package and a separate plan to spend $2.3 trillion on the nation’s infrastructure. Mr. Biden’s first spending request to Congress showcases his belief that expanding, not shrinking, the federal government is crucial to economic growth and prosperity. It would direct billions of dollars toward reducing inequities in housing and education, as well as making sure every government agency puts climate change at the front of its agenda. It does not include tax proposals, economic projections or so-called mandatory programs like Social Security, which will all be included in a formal budget request the White House will release this spring. Among its major new spending initiatives, the plan would dedicate an additional $20 billion to help schools that serve low-income children and provide more money to students who have experienced racial or economic barriers to higher education. It would create a multi-billion-dollar program for researching diseases like cancer and add $14 billion to fight and adapt to the damages of climate change. It would also seek to lift the economies of Central American countries, where rampant poverty, corruption and devastating hurricanes have fueled migration toward the southwestern border and a variety of initiatives to address homelessness and housing affordability, including on tribal lands. And it asks for an increase of about 2 percent in spending on national defense. The request represents a sharp break with the policies of President Donald J. Trump, whose budget proposals prioritized military spending and border security, while seeking to cut funding in areas like environmental protection. All told, the proposal calls for a $118 billion increase in discretionary spending in the 2022 fiscal year, when compared with the base spending allocations this year. It seeks to capitalize on the expiration of a decade of caps on spending growth, which lawmakers agreed to in 2010 but frequently breached in subsequent years. Administration officials would not specify on Friday whether that increase would result in higher federal deficits in their coming budget proposal, but promised its full budget would “address the overlapping challenges we face in a fiscally and economically responsible way.” As part of that effort, the request seeks $1 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service to enforce tax laws, including “increased oversight of high-income and corporate tax returns.” That is clearly aimed at raising tax receipts by cracking down on tax avoidance by companies and the wealthy. Officials said the proposals did not reflect the spending called for in Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan, which he introduced last week, or for a second plan he has yet to roll out, which will focus on what officials call “human infrastructure” like education and child care. Congress, which is responsible for approving government spending, is under no requirement to adhere to White House requests. In recent years, lawmakers rejected many of the Trump administration’s efforts to gut domestic programs. But Mr. Biden’s plan, while incomplete as a budget, could provide a blueprint for Democrats who narrowly control the House and Senate and are anxious to reassert their spending priorities after four years of a Republican White House.

Here’s what happened in the markets today. Stocks on Wall Street climbed further into record territory on Friday: The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 percent, bringing its gain for the week to 2.7 percent.

Shares of Amazon rose 2.2 percent after the company prevailed against a unionization drive at a warehouse in Alabama.

The relatively steady gains in the stock market have sent the VIX index, a measure of volatility, to its lowest level since February 2020. The index was below 17 points on Friday. In mid-March, as the pandemic shut down parts of the global economy, the VIX had spiked above 80.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes jumped 4 basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.66 percent. The yield on 10-year government bonds rose across Europe, too.

On Thursday, Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, reiterated his intention to keep supporting the economic recovery The rollout of vaccinations meant the United States economy could probably reopen soon, but the recovery was still “uneven and incomplete,” Mr. Powell said at the International Monetary Fund annual conference.

European stock indexes were mixed on Friday, though the Stoxx Europe 600 notched its sixth straight week of gains. The DAX index in Germany rose 0.2 percent after data showed an unexpected drop in industrial production. The FTSE 100 in London fell 0.4 percent.

Oil prices fell slightly with futures of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. crude benchmark, 0.4 percent lower to $59.38 a barrel.

Michigan’s governor, confronting a surge in virus cases, calls on Biden for more vaccines. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:07 - 0:00 transcript Michigan’s Governor Urges Caution as Virus Cases Surge Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan called on residents of the state to exercise caution and practice upholding social distancing measures as coronavirus cases across the state spread. Anyone who looks at a Covid map knows Michigan is unquestionably a national hotspot, right now. My team and I have been in regular conversation with the national Covid response team, and we have asked for more vaccines. But as we take a hard look at the data and observe the spread of the variants, we all need to go above and beyond the rules we already have in place. We all have to step up our game for the next two weeks to bring down rising cases. And that’s why I’m calling on high schools to voluntarily go remote for two weeks past spring break. Calling on youth sports to voluntarily suspend games and practices for two weeks. And I’m strongly encouraging all Michiganders to avoid dining indoors and avoid gathering with friends indoors for two weeks. This is my ask to you, the people of Michigan. Please redouble your efforts on these fronts for the next couple of weeks. I know Michiganders are concerned about the latest rise in cases, and I am too. We’ve come so far, we’ve sacrificed so much. This has changed every aspect of our lives for over a year. We can’t let up now, not when we’re so close. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan called on residents of the state to exercise caution and practice upholding social distancing measures as coronavirus cases across the state spread. Credit Credit... Jake May/The Flint Journal, via Associated Press Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan said Friday that she had urged President Biden to surge Covid-19 vaccines into her state, where a worst-in-the-nation outbreak has filled hospitals and forced some schools to close. “I made the case for a surge strategy. At this point that’s not being deployed, but I am not giving up,” Ms. Whitmer said, describing a Thursday evening call with the president. “Today it’s Michigan and the Midwest. Tomorrow it could be another section of our country.” Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat whom the president considered as a potential running mate, took pains to praise aspects of Mr. Biden’s coronavirus response at a Friday news conference. But Ms. Whitmer said a rapid influx of shots, particularly the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, was essential to tamping down case numbers even as she resisted additional restrictions on gatherings and businesses. Johnson & Johnson will send 86 percent fewer doses across the United States next week than are currently being allocated, according to data provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, dealing a setback to a national vaccination campaign that has just found its footing. Michigan is slated to get another 17,500 Johnson & Johnson doses next week, an 88 percent drop compared to the nearly 148,000 doses it was allocated this week, according to C.D.C. data. “The Biden administration does have a strategy and by in large it is working,” Ms. Whitmer said. “As should be expected, though, in an undertaking of this magnitude, there are shortcomings and different points of view.” About 75 percent of vaccine doses sent to Michigan have been administered, according to federal data, near the middle of the pack nationally. Jeff Zients, the White House Covid coordinator, said at a news briefing on Friday that the administration does not plan to shift additional vaccine doses to hard-hit states like Michigan. “There are tens of millions of people across the country in each and every state and county who have not yet been vaccinated, and the fair and equitable way to distribute the vaccine is based on the adult population by state, tribe and territory,” he said. “That’s how it’s been done, and we will continue to do so. The virus is unpredictable. We don’t know where the next increase in cases could occur.” Ms. Whitmer elevated her national profile last year by taking a tough, unapologetic approach to restrictions despite pushback from the Republicans who control the state’s Legislature. But as cases have risen again this year, she has taken a dramatically different tack. On Friday, she asked for high schools to voluntarily move classes online for two weeks and asked youth sports organizers to pause games and practices during that period. Ms. Whitmer also suggested, but did not require, that residents avoid eating inside restaurants for two weeks. “It is less of a policy problem that we have and more of a compliance and variants issue that we are confronting,” Ms. Whitmer said. “Policy change alone won’t change the tide. We need everyone to step up and to take personal responsibility here.” Ms. Whitmer’s decision not to lock down again brought some measure of agreement on Friday from Republicans, who control the Legislature and have for months criticized her use of executive power and warned that residents were losing patience with restrictions. “I think what’s happening now is she is realizing that she has lost the goodwill of the people,” said State Representative Jack O’Malley, a Republican. Still, the outbreak in Michigan is bad and getting worse. Hospitalizations have more than tripled in the last month and cases continue to spike. About 7,200 new cases are being reported each day, a sevenfold increase since late February. And 16 of the 20 metro areas with the country’s highest recent case rates are in Michigan. Debra Furr-Holden, an epidemiologist at Michigan State University, said before the governor’s announcement on Friday that the state should reimpose restrictions that were loosened just before the most recent surge. “What it looks like happened is she tried to be fair and meet us in the middle,” said Dr. Furr-Holden, who was appointed last year by Ms. Whitmer to the state’s Coronavirus Task Force on Racial Disparities. “And what I think we’ve learned — and I hope other states will get the message — is that there really isn’t a lot of middle ground here. We just have to tighten up and hold tight.” But there is also a sense — articulated by Ms. Whitmer, politicians from both parties and even some public health officials — that pandemic fatigue and partisanship have limited the effectiveness that any new state mandates might have. “It’s been a long time,” said Mayor Pauline Repp of Port Huron, where case rates are among the highest in the country. “It’s a long time to be restrictive and you get to the point where you kind of think, ‘Will life ever go back to normal?’” Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.

France says those under 55 who got a first AstraZeneca shot should follow up with a different vaccine. Administering the AstraZeneca vaccine in Paris. Credit... Christophe Archambault/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Recipients of a first dose of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine who are under 55 should get a second shot with other vaccines, France’s top health regulator said on Friday. Several European countries briefly suspended use of the AstraZeneca vaccine last month because of the risk of rare blood clots. France resumed administering shots of the AstraZeneca vaccine after European health regulators vouched for it, though only to people 55 and older. That left over 500,000 younger people who had received a first dose wondering how they would get their second. (In Britain, the authorities recommended the opposite strategy on Thursday: Health Minister Matt Hancock said that the 1.5 million people age 18 to 29 who had received one AstraZeneca dose should get a second injection of the same vaccine. Others, he said, would be offered an alternative.) France’s top health agency said on Friday that a single shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine was “insufficient” for lasting and efficient protection from the virus. It recommended administering a shot of vaccines like those produced by Pfizer or Moderna 12 weeks after the initial AstraZeneca jab. The new guidelines in France come amid growing skepticism over the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine across Europe. In Spain, the authorities in the Madrid region said that nearly 20,000 people had turned down the vaccine on Thursday after the country’s central government changed the age threshold for its use to 60. A regional health official said that more than 60 percent of the people called up for vaccination in Madrid had not shown up, higher than the no-show rate of two percent before the authorities announced the change. The official, Antonio Zapatero, called on the central government and European officials to authorize the use of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine to speed up the country’s vaccination campaign. In France, Dominique Le Guludec, who heads the country’s top health agency, said at a news conference that the immune reaction to a second dose was sometimes stronger than the first, which could expose younger people to heightened risks of rare blood clotting if they got a second AstraZeneca shot. Prof. Élisabeth Bouvet, who leads the health authority’s vaccine committee, said at the news conference that clinical data on mixing and matching vaccines was still sparse. But she stressed that available data indicated that the strategy was safe. “There is no reason to fear any particular side effects,” Professor Bouvet said. The health authority said that the mixing of Covid-19 vaccines would be closely monitored to assess people’s immune response and to ensure adequate protection from the virus. The twists and turns over use of the AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe have put a dent in people’s trust in the vaccine over the past months, but Ms. Le Guludec emphasized that it was still efficient and broadly safe to use. “Those older than 55 represent over 95 percent of the 98,000 people who have died of the coronavirus in France,” she said. “This vaccine will therefore save lives, and if we want to win the battle against the virus, we must use all the weapons at our disposal.” Aurelien Breeden and

Europe’s drug regulator investigates some blood clots after Johnson & Johnson shots, but no link is clear. Preparing a dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in Hempstead, N.Y., last month. Credit... Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The risk-assessment committee of the European Medicines Agency is investigating whether a handful of blood-clotting events could be linked to Johnson & Johnson’s one-dose vaccine, the agency said on Friday, though it was unclear whether there was any causal link. The agency, which is the European Union drug regulator, said serious cases of “unusual blood clots with low blood platelets” have been reported in four people after they received the Johnson & Johnson shot. It’s unclear if any of them were caused by the vaccine. One of the cases emerged in a clinical trial, though it was not immediately clear where the trial was held. Three other cases were found in people in the United States after vaccinations. One of the four people died, though it was unclear where it happened. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 4.9 million people in the United States, as of Thursday, have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson shot, which was developed by the company’s drug development arm, Janssen Pharmaceuticals. The Food and Drug Administration did not have an immediate statement. The company noted that blood clotting events have been reported with other Covid-19 vaccines. “Our close tracking of side effects has revealed a small number of very rare events following vaccination,” the company said in a statement. “At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine.” The vaccine, which is easier to store than vaccines manufactured by other companies and has the benefit of being a one-and-done shot, is being widely used only in the United States. It has been approved for use by European Union states, but has not yet been rolled out, the agency said. Use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been limited in many countries because of blood-clotting issues. Earlier this week, the European Medicines Agency said that blood clots and low blood platelets should be listed as a very rare side effect of that vaccine. A blood clot is a thickened, gelatinous blob of blood that can block circulation. Clots form in response to injuries and can also be caused by many illnesses, including cancer and genetic disorders, certain drugs and prolonged sitting or bed rest. Clots that form in the legs sometimes break off and travel to the lungs or, rarely to the brain, where they can be deadly. Blood clots are common in the general population. From 300,000 to 600,000 people a year in the United States develop blood clots in their lungs or in veins in the legs or other parts of the body, according to the C.D.C.

Trump health advisers cheered attempts to alter scientific reports, emails show. Former Trump health adviser Paul Alexander sent messages to Michael Caputo, right, celebrating efforts to alter reports by career scientists. Credit... Sam Hodgson for The New York Times Political appointees in the Trump administration’s health and human services department celebrated their efforts last year to alter reports written by career scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to new emails released by the House’s select committee investigating the federal government’s pandemic response. Paul Alexander, a science adviser in the department’s communications office who regularly clashed with the C.D.C., wrote to the agency’s acting chief of staff, Nina Witkofsky, in August claiming that attempts to influence the agency’s closely-guarded guidance on disease outbreaks, known as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports, had been a success. “The last 2 MMWR reports have been more positive than usual and I find encouraging,” Dr. Alexander wrote. “So have you seen this shift? Maybe you are having a huge impact and this is tremendous. Well done!” The emails were the latest evidence of how a small group of Trump loyalists at the Department of Health and Human Services used their roles last year to question career scientists at the C.D.C. and label them antagonists bent on hurting the political fortunes of Mr. Trump. Their messages were released as part of the House investigation into the federal government’s pandemic response. The committee asked for interviews with Dr. Alexander and Dr. Scott Atlas, a White House pandemic adviser with no background in infectious disease responses. Dr. Alexander, who had been a part-time professor at McMaster University in Canada, and Michael Caputo, a longtime Trump loyalist with no health background, repeatedly attempted to edit and halt the agency’s latest research on the spread of the virus. In a separate email with the subject line “Examples of CDC adjusting writing based on my inquiry,” Dr. Alexander claimed success in altering a report on transmission of the virus at an overnight camp. The changes, Dr. Alexander wrote, were a “small victory but a victory nonetheless and yippee!!!” In one exchange last May between Dr. Alexander and Mr. Caputo, the two planned an effort they saw as a boost to Mr. Trump: organizing data on what they viewed as the social and economic costs of shutdown policies. That campaign would be similar to one the president waged as he fought against states with more restrictive responses to the virus. “I know the President wants us to enumerate the economic cost of not reopening. We need solid estimates to be able to say something like: 50,000 more cancer deaths! 40,000 more heart attacks!” wrote Mr. Caputo, who at one point accused C.D.C. scientists of sedition. “You need to take ownership of these numbers. This is singularly important to what you and I want to achieve.” Around the time Dr. Alexander celebrated his efforts to edit the C.D.C. reports, he worked to draft an op-ed column under the name of Dr. Atlas, pushing to keep schools open during the pandemic. It later appeared in the New York Post.

German lawmakers move to strengthen the government’s powers in the pandemic. In Berlin last month. Credit... Lena Mucha for The New York Times BERLIN — Germany’s government plans to ask lawmakers to grant it stronger powers in order to introduce a nationwide lockdown as the country is gripped by a third wave of the coronavirus. The country’s approach has so far been to have the governors of Germany’s 16 states agree to any nationwide pandemic policies. But as calls from public health officials have grown stronger for a new nationwide lockdown in recent weeks, Chancellor Angela Merkel has had trouble gaining all of the governors’ support. The lawmakers’ new plan seeks overcome regional differences in how to curb the latest surge in cases. It will be put before Ms. Merkel’s cabinet next week, Ulrike Demmer, a spokeswoman for the chancellor, told reporters on Friday. The law would spell out which restrictions would be imposed in areas with over 100 new cases per 100,000 residents over a period of seven days. “Germany is in the middle of a third wave, so the federal government and the states have agreed to add to the national legislation,” Ms. Demmer said. Last month, the chancellor sought to impose a strict lockdown over the Easter holiday weekend, only to retract that move in the face of criticism from opposition lawmakers and industry leaders. She also offered a public apology. Speaking on national television, she then raised the idea of seeking Parliament’s support in consolidating her government’s powers to ensure that all states abide by the same rules. Germany has been wary of consolidating power in the central government since World War II, but several lawmakers have backed the idea for this specific circumstance. “The aim here is to create uniform national rules,” Ms. Demmer said, adding that the law change would be put before cabinet on Tuesday. The German authorities registered 25,464 new infections on Thursday, 3,576 more than a week ago. On Thursday, nearly 300 people died of the virus. “There will be, once again, a couple of difficult weeks,” Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Friday, calling for a unified lockdown. “It is about not overburdening our health care system. It is about protecting human lives.” A planned meeting between the chancellor and state leaders that was planned for Monday was canceled as part of the decision, Ms. Demmer said. Christopher F. Schuetze contributed reporting.

As a virus variant sweeps Europe, a look at lessons for the rest of the world. Video The coronavirus variant first detected in Britain is now spreading in at least 114 countries, and nowhere are its devastating effects as visible as in Europe, where thousands are dying each day and already-battered economies are being hit by new restrictions on daily life. The variant, known as B.1.1.7, is not only more contagious than the virus’s initial form, but is also deadlier. With the mutation now propelling a surge in cases in Europe — the epicenter of the pandemic last spring — an interactive article by The New York Times’s graphics team outlines the toll that the B.1.1.7 variant is taking on the continent, and lessons that it might offer the world. Having surged in Britain starting in December, the variant also seeded outbreaks across the continent, but many went unnoticed behind an overall drop in cases. Those outbreaks have since ballooned, and B.1.1.7 has crowded out other versions of the virus, becoming dominant in more than a dozen European countries. Despite watching the B.1.1.7 variant wallop Britain, lawmakers in continental Europe were slow to react. In late January, President Emmanuel Macron of France defied calls from his scientific advisers for new restrictions. Now, daily cases have doubled, hospitals are swelling with patients and Mr. Macron has imposed a third national lockdown. “What’s surprising to me is how many countries didn’t anticipate what B.1.1.7 would bring,” said Devi Sridhar, a professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. “People underestimated it, instead of saying we should learn from what’s happening in the U.K.” Josh Holder, Allison McCann and

Covax falls short of goals to get Covid-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income nations. People in Nairobi, Kenya, waited in line on Thursday to receive doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine provided through the Covax initiative. Covax announced it has not reached its distribution goal due to short supply of doses. Credit... Brian Inganga/Associated Press Covax, a global initiative dedicated to distributing coronavirus vaccines to low- and middle-income countries, has delivered just 38 million doses so far, falling short of the 100 million doses it had expected to distribute by now, the World Health Organization said on Friday. “Most countries do not have anywhere near enough vaccines to cover all health workers, or all at-risk groups, never mind the rest of their populations,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O. “There remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines.” Tracking Coronavirus Vaccinations Around the World More than 733 million vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, equal to 9.6 doses for every 100 people. Although the pace of vaccinations has sped up considerably in the United States, where about a third of the total population has received at least one shot of the vaccine, enormous disparities exist between nations. In other high-income countries, nearly one in four adults have received a vaccine, Dr. Tedros said. In low-income countries, which have received just 0.2 percent of the world’s vaccine supply so far, that figure is one in 500. Covax, which is run by the W.H.O. and relies on donors, was $32 billion short of the funding it needed, Dr. Tedros said in February. China and Russia have been donating vaccine supplies globally, while the United States has focused on vaccinating its entire adult population as quickly as possible. The Biden administration had agreed to donate $4 billion to Covax earlier this year, and it has faced pressure to donate more of its supply after securing more than enough vaccine doses to guarantee American adults can be inoculated. The W.H.O. and other Covax partners are currently investigating ways to boost supply, including accelerating the release of new vaccines and asking for donations from countries that have extra doses, Dr. Tedros added.

Vaccine passports could bring back international travel, in some cases at the risk of discrimination. A woman showed her Green Pass before entering a show at an opera house in Tel Aviv. Israel is one of the countries that has already implemented the use of digital vaccine passports. Credit... Dan Balilty for The New York Times Vaccine rollouts in some countries have world travelers dreaming of trips abroad again, as travel destinations eagerly await the return of the tourism lifeline. But a ticket to travel that requires some kind of vaccine documentation has set off a fraught debate about the fairness of a two-tier system for haves and have-nots. Almost everywhere, the pressure to restart international travel is forcing the debate. With tens of millions of people vaccinated, and governments desperate to reopen their economies, businesses and individuals are pushing to regain more freedom of movement. Verifying whether someone is inoculated is the simplest way to do that. At its simplest, this verification is something like the physical card created by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, typically given to people in the United States after their first Covid-19 shot. Similarly, the World Health Organization has a “yellow card,” used for decades by travelers to show inoculation against diseases like yellow fever. But paper documents are vulnerable to forgery, which makes vaccine passports (as they are commonly called) appealing as an electronic record of vaccination — possibly in the form of a QR code easily accessible through a smartphone, or possibly stored on the device or printed out. Some versions are taking shape or already in use. Israel’s version, for example, allows people who are fully vaccinated to go to bars, restaurants, concerts and sporting events. (Israel has vaccinated more than half its population, and the vast majority of its older people.) At this point, allowing access only to vaccinated people deprives young people of access to many of the pleasures of their elders. In most cases, consideration of vaccine passports has heavily focused on international travel and not domestic everyday life. In some strictly quarantined countries like China and Singapore, it is not clear that a vaccine passport designed for travel would also be used for citizens at home, setting up another inconsistency between those who can afford to travel freely overseas and those who continue to live under onerous restrictions at home. Any requirement to prove vaccination status would discriminate against those who can’t get the shot or refuse to, and there is lingering uncertainty about how well inoculation prevents virus transmission. For those reasons, the W.H.O. said this week that it does not support requiring proof of vaccination for travel — for now. Mark Landler and

Hong Kong residents stranded in Britain meet frustration as they try to return. A man waiting for the results of a mandatory Covid-19 test given to all new arrivals at Hong Kong International Airport in October. Credit... Anthony Wallace/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The Hong Kong government said last month that it would allow hundreds of residents who have been stranded in Britain by virus-related travel restrictions to return on two special flights. But when those residents went to book seats on flights, the website for Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong’s flag carrier, crashed. The snafu on Thursday was the latest chapter in a bureaucratic saga that has left them feeling angry, confused and exasperated. The Hong Kong government suspended flights from Britain in December as a coronavirus variant spread through that country. It also barred anyone who had spent more than two hours there or in other “extremely high-risk” places in the previous 21 days from boarding a direct flight to the Chinese territory. Those measures, which remain in effect, also apply to inbound travelers who have recently been to Brazil, Ireland or South Africa. But last week Hong Kong said that it would arrange two special return flights from London on Cathay Pacific in late April. It cited Britain’s declining caseload and “satisfactory vaccination progress” as reasons for the policy shift. When the airline’s website crashed on Thursday, said Anthony Sheik Bux, a district councilor in Hong Kong who has been helping the stranded travelers, “people panicked” and started contacting him. In a statement on Friday, Cathay Pacific apologized for the glitch and said that roughly 600 seats on the two flights — scheduled for April 21 and April 28 — had sold out after the website problem was resolved. The South China Morning Post newspaper reported last week that the travel ban had stranded more than 600 Hong Kong residents in Britain. Mr. Bux said on Friday that some of them had been unable to book seats on the special flights. It was unclear whether additional flights would be offered, or why officials in Hong Kong, where the borders have been closed to nonresidents for more than a year, waited more than three months to schedule the two flights. A spokeswoman for the Immigration Department referred questions on Friday to the Food and Health Bureau, which declined to comment. Mr. Bux said he could sympathize with the stranded travelers because he, too, had been stranded by the December ban while visiting family in Liverpool. He said he was among the 200 to 300 Hong Kong residents who had managed to make it home from Britain after spending a 21-day “wash out” period in a third country like Thailand, Egypt or the United Arab Emirates. In Mr. Bux’s case, he flew to Bangkok on Feb. 7 and arrived home more than three weeks later — only to begin a mandatory three-week hotel quarantine, one of the world’s longest. Some scientists have questioned whether that policy is too strict because the coronavirus is widely considered to have a 14-day incubation period. “After my departure from the U.K., I needed 42 days to resume my normal life in Hong Kong,” he said. “It’s a really long period.”

The struggle against vaccine hesitancy comes to Mississippi. Volunteers assisting people who received the Moderna vaccine at a drive-through site on the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss., in March. Credit... Rory Doyle for The New York Times When it comes to getting a coronavirus vaccine, Mississippi residents have an abundance of options. On Thursday, there were more than 73,000 slots to be had on the state’s scheduling website, up from 68,000 on Tuesday. In some ways, that growing availability of appointments is something to celebrate: It reflects the mounting supplies that have prompted states across the country to open up eligibility to anyone over 16. But public health experts say it also exposes something more worrisome: the large number of people who are reluctant to be inoculated. “It’s time to do the heavy lifting needed to overcome the hesitancy we’re encountering,” said Dr. Obie McNair, an internal medicine practitioner in Jackson, the state capital. Although access remains a problem in rural Mississippi, experts say that the state — which three weeks ago became one of the first to open eligibility to all adults — may be a harbinger of what much of the country will confront in the coming weeks as increasing supplies enable most Americans who want the vaccine to easily make appointments. Demographics help explain Mississippi’s challenge. The state reliably votes Republican, a group that remains highly skeptical of coronavirus vaccines. And its population is 38 percent Black, a group that in one recent survey indicated a lower willingness to be vaccinated than Hispanic or white people. The hesitancy has national implications. Experts say that 70 to 90 percent of people in the United States must be vaccinated for the country to reach herd immunity, the point at which the virus can no longer spread through the population. In Mississippi, a quarter of all residents have received at least one vaccine dose, compared with the nationwide average of 33 percent, according to state data. Other Southern states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia and Tennessee, have similarly low rates of vaccination. Some other heavily Republican states are also finding themselves with surfeits of doses. Officials in Oklahoma, which has delivered at least one dose to 34 percent of its residents, said on Thursday that they would open up eligibility to out-of-state residents. In recent weeks, Republican governors in Ohio and Georgia voiced concern about lackluster vaccine demand among their residents. Tim Callaghan, an assistant professor at the Texas A&M University School of Public Health and an expert on vaccine skepticism, said that more research was needed to determine the reasons behind Mississippi’s slackening vaccine demand, but that states with large rural populations, Republican voters and African-Americans were likely to be the first to confront the problem. “If you’re looking to see vaccine hesitancy to emerge,” he said, “it’s going to be in red states like Mississippi.”

Yosemite National Park will limit the number of visitors this summer. Visiting Yosemite Valley National Park in California in November. Credit... Peter Dasilva/EPA, via Shutterstock Reservations will be required for day visitors to Yosemite National Park beginning next month, the park said on Thursday, a system that officials hope will reduce the risk of Covid-19 exposure as the demand for domestic travel increases around the United States. Yosemite, in central California, has seen more than four million annual visitors in recent years, with people drawn to its giant sequoia groves, wilderness and waterfalls. Last year, that number was cut nearly in half, according to the National Park Service. Day-use reservations will be required for all visitors this year, including annual and lifetime pass holders, the park said in a news release. Reservations will be valid for three days and will be required from May 21 through Sept. 30, or until local public health conditions improve. “The health and safety of park visitors, employees and partners continues to be our number one priority,” the park said. It added that it would continue to work with local public health officials to ensure that visitation would not overwhelm the region’s “limited rural health care system.” Yosemite National Park also instituted a reservation system last summer, and this summer similar programs have been announced by Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado and Glacier National Park in Montana. Travel across the United States has been on the rise in recent weeks, and travel experts expect domestic travel this summer to grow to within 5 percent of prepandemic levels. On March 12, more than 1.3 million people passed through U.S. airports, the highest number on any day since March 2020. Airlines have also added new flight routes and revived old ones, another sign that demand is picking up as national vaccination rates rise.

Some experts call for delaying second shots to speed vaccinations. A healthcare worker prepares doses of a Covid-19 vaccine at a clinic in Derbyshire, England, last month. Britain has been delaying second doses of the vaccine in an effort to vaccinate more people. Credit... Oli Scarff/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The prospect of a fourth wave of the coronavirus, with new cases climbing sharply in the Upper Midwest, has reignited a debate among vaccine experts over how long to wait between the first and second doses. Extending that period would swiftly increase the number of people with the partial protection of a single shot, but some experts fear it could also give rise to dangerous new variants. In the United States, two-dose vaccines are spaced three to four weeks apart, matching what was tested in clinical trials. But in Britain, health authorities have delayed doses by up to 12 weeks in order to reach more people more quickly. And in Canada, which has precious few vaccines to go around, a government advisory committee recommended on Wednesday that second doses be delayed even longer, up to four months. Some health experts think the United States should follow suit. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a co-director of the Healthcare Transformation Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, has proposed that for the next few weeks, all U.S. vaccines should go to people receiving their first dose. “That should be enough to quell the fourth surge, especially in places like Michigan, like Minnesota,” he said in an interview. Dr. Emanuel and his colleagues published the proposal in an op-ed on Thursday in USA Today. But opponents, including health advisers to the Biden administration, argue that delaying doses is a bad idea. They warn it will leave the country vulnerable to variants — those already circulating, as well as new ones that could evolve inside the bodies of partially vaccinated people who are not able to swiftly fight off an infection. “It’s a very dangerous proposal to leave the second dose to a later date,” said Dr. Luciana Borio, the former acting chief scientist of the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-diseases expert, agreed. “Let’s go with what we know is the optimal degree of protection,” he said. Britain has been able get first doses into an impressive number of arms. As of Thursday, 48 percent of the British population has received at least one dose. By contrast, the United States has delivered at least one dose to just 33 percent of Americans. In January, some researchers lobbied for the United States to follow Britain’s example. But the government stayed the course, arguing that it would be unwise to veer off into the unknown in the middle of a pandemic. Although the clinical trials did show some early protection from the first dose, no one knew how well that partial protection would last. In recent weeks, however, proponents of delaying doses have been able to point to mounting evidence suggesting that a first dose can provide potent protection that lasts for a number of weeks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that two weeks after a single dose of either the Moderna or the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a person’s risk of coronavirus infection dropped by 80 percent.

Global Roundup In England, vacations abroad may be allowed next month, and other news from across the world. Passengers at Heathrow Airport in London this year. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is expected to announce new travel recommendations on May 17. Credit... Matthew Childs/Reuters England’s residents will probably be allowed to travel abroad this summer, a government official said on Friday, as the authorities plan to announce new travel guidelines next month. “For the first time, people can start to think about visiting loved ones abroad, or perhaps a summer holiday, but we’re doing it very, very cautiously,” said Grant Shapps, the transportation minister. For months, the authorities in the country have asked residents not to book summer vacations abroad, and the cautious recommendation on Friday was the first official indication that travel could soon be allowed. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is expected to announce new travel recommendations on May 17 based on a tiered system that would outline whether travelers returning to England from various countries must isolate, and where. On Monday, England is scheduled to reopen outdoor spaces in pubs and restaurants, as well as nonessential shops, gyms and hair salons. In other news from other the world: Hong Kong’s health secretary, Sophia Chan, said on Friday that the Chinese territory would delay a shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines that had been scheduled to arrive in the second half of this year. She said the government had sufficient supplies of the Sinovac and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and did not want to waste any doses. Germany recorded its highest number of Covid-19 vaccinations on Thursday, with nearly 720,000 people receiving either a first or second dose. The authorities attributed the sharp rise to increased supplies and the addition of family doctors to the vaccine drive. People who are fully vaccinated will not have to present proof of a negative Covid test to travel or to enter shops, as is now the case in some regions, Health Minister Jens Spahn said on Friday. He said at a news conference, however, that Germany could soon require a new nationwide lockdown and a nighttime curfew as the country’s intensive-care units risk being overwhelmed.

In Japan, the authorities issued stricter measures in Tokyo, Kyoto and Okinawa set to begin on Monday. Restaurants and bars will have to close by 8 p.m., and large events will be capped at 5,000 people. The measures are expected to be in place until May 11 in Tokyo and May 5 in Kyoto and Okinawa.

In Norway, Prime Minister Erna Solberg was fined for organizing a party that violated social distancing rules. She celebrated her 60th birthday with 13 guests at a mountain resort in late February, even though her government had limited such gatherings to 10 people. Ms. Solberg, who has been leading Norway since 2013, was fined about $2,350. Christopher F. Schuetze , Mike Ives , Makiko Inoue and Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting.

Iraq warns of dire consequences as coronavirus infections reach a record high. Worshippers attending an Easter Mass at St. Elya Chaldean Church in Baghdad on Sunday. Credit... Khalid Al-Mousily/Reuters Iraq reported a record high number of coronavirus cases this week, a situation that the authorities blamed on “the negligence of most citizens, government institutions and the private sector” in disregarding social distancing guidelines, not wearing masks and continuing to hold large events. The health ministry warned that country’s health care system was becoming overwhelmed by a “very dangerous level” of infection. It also said it was alarmed by the low turnout for Covid-19 inoculations in Iraq, for which it blamed rumors that the vaccines are harmful. The country on Wednesday reported 8,331 new coronavirus cases — the highest figure since the pandemic began. A further 7,817 cases were added on Thursday. Iraq has reported over 14,500 Covid-19 deaths, and public health officials believe that the numbers of infections and deaths have been underreported. Many of those infected do not seek treatment in the country’s dysfunctional public health care system. Despite the pandemic, Iraqis have routinely held wedding celebrations and funeral gatherings. Many Iraqis are now rushing to hold weddings before the start next week of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when weddings traditionally do not take place. The semiautonomous Kurdistan region this week barred entry for people from other parts of Iraq. The police in the Kurdish capital, Erbil, have been deployed to enforce the wearing of masks in public. Slightly more than 126,000 Iraqis have been vaccinated, according to the health ministry — a tiny portion of the country’s 40 million inhabitants. A first batch of 336,000 doses from the Covax international vaccine sharing initiative arrived in Iraq in March, according to the aid group Doctors Without Borders. The aid group described Iraq as in the grip of a second wave of the pandemic, with Baghdad as its epicenter.

Prince Philip will lie in rest at Windsor Castle before a funeral in St. George’s Chapel. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:35 - 0:00 transcript Remembering Prince Philip, Husband of Queen Elizabeth II Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died on Friday at Windsor Castle in England. He was 99. Announcer: “It’s easy to see the radiant happiness of the princess as she and her very good-looking husband-to-be posed for the cameras in the palace. In the evening, Londoners, who had been waiting outside the palace for hours, made their feelings perfectly clear, when princess and her fiancé came out onto the balcony.” Announcer: “Now the most triumphant of all marches, the princess and prince. Once mere Lieutenant Mountbatten in His Majesty’s Navy, march as man and wife toward the West door.” Announcer: “And his work ashore here is as much a part of his regular service as it was when he was at sea in the destroyer H.M.S. Whelp, for example.” “Main lesson that we’ve learned is that tolerance is the one essential ingredient of any happy marriage. It may not be quite so important when things are going well, but it is absolutely vital when things get difficult.” Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died on Friday at Windsor Castle in England. He was 99. Credit Credit... Andrew Milligan/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images The death of Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, at 99 on Friday came at the end of a year marked by mourning, with 150,000 lives lost to Covid-19 in Britain. Buckingham Palace said that Prince Philip had died peacefully, and he was vaccinated against the coronavirus early this year, along with the queen. Yet his death is likely to take on a new meaning in the middle of a pandemic, and to raise many questions: What will the funeral look like at a time of social distancing measures? And with families across Britain unable to hold typical funerals for loved ones lost to Covid-19, how will the country’s most famous family mourn one of their own? The palace said that a full outline would likely be released on Saturday, but details began to emerge on Friday. The ceremony will not be a state funeral and will not be preceded by a lying-in-state, according to a statement from the College of Arms, which has created and maintained official registers of coats of arms and pedigrees since 1484. “His Royal Highness’s body will lie at rest in Windsor Castle ahead of the funeral in St. George’s Chapel,” the statement said. “The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added, “and it is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral.” Philip had been hospitalized in February for a heart problem and was discharged last month. Buckingham Palace said that his hospitalization was not related to the coronavirus. But the privileges of royalty did not grant the family immunity from the virus. Prince Charles — Prince Philip’s and Queen Elizabeth’s elder son and the heir to the throne — tested positive for the virus last year, as did Prince William, their grandson. The queen has encouraged people in the country to be vaccinated. “Once you’ve had the vaccine, you have a feeling of, you know, you’re protected,” she said in a public call with health officials. Britain is slowly emerging from a stringent national lockdown of recent months, with outdoor spaces in pubs and restaurants scheduled to reopen on Monday, as well as nonessential shops, gyms and hair salons. But many bereaved families of those lost to Covid-19 have said that as the country moves to brighter days, the staggering deaths of 150,000 people should not be forgotten.",0
158,"To Speed Vaccination, Some Call for Delaying Second Shots","The prospect of a fourth wave of the coronavirus, with new cases climbing sharply in the Upper Midwest, has reignited a debate among vaccine experts over how long to wait between the first and second doses. Extending that period would swiftly increase the number of people with the partial protection of a single shot, but some experts fear it could also give rise to dangerous new variants.

In the United States, two-dose vaccines are spaced three to four weeks apart, matching what was tested in clinical trials. But in Britain, health authorities have delayed doses by up to 12 weeks in order to reach more people more quickly. And in Canada, which has precious few vaccines to go around, a government advisory committee recommended on Wednesday that second doses be delayed even longer, up to four months.

Some health experts think the United States should follow suit. Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a co-director of the Healthcare Transformation Institute at the University of Pennsylvania, has proposed that for the next few weeks, all U.S. vaccines should go to people receiving their first dose.

“That should be enough to quell the fourth surge, especially in places like Michigan, like Minnesota,” he said in an interview. Dr. Emanuel and his colleagues published the proposal in an op-ed on Thursday in USA Today.",0
159,Complacency and Missteps Deepen a Covid-19 Crisis in India,"NEW DELHI — When the coronavirus first struck India last year, the country enforced one of the world’s strictest national lockdowns. The warning was clear: A fast spread in a population of 1.3 billion would be devastating.

Though damaging and ultimately flawed, the lockdown and other efforts appeared to work. Infections dropped and deaths remained low. Officials and the public dropped their guard. Experts warned fruitlessly that the government’s haphazard approach would bring a crisis when a new wave appeared.

Now the crisis is here.

India on Friday reported a daily record of 131,878 new infections as Covid-19 races out of control. Deaths, while still relatively low, are rising. Vaccinations, a mammoth task in such a large nation, are dangerously behind schedule. Hospital beds are running short.

Parts of the country are reinforcing lockdowns. Scientists are rushing to track new strains, including the more hazardous variants found in Britain and South Africa, that may be hastening the spread. But the authorities have declared contact tracing in some places to be simply impossible.",0

Biden proposes $1.52 trillion in spending as the White House releases fragments of his first budget. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during a White House appearance on Thursday. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times President Biden proposed a vast expansion of federal spending on Friday, calling for a 16 percent increase in domestic programs as he tries to harness the government’s power to reverse what officials called a decade of underinvestment in the nation’s most pressing issues. The proposed $1.52 trillion in spending on discretionary programs would significantly bolster education, health research and fighting climate change. It comes on top of Mr. Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package and a separate plan to spend $2.3 trillion on the nation’s infrastructure. Mr. Biden’s first spending request to Congress showcases his belief that expanding, not shrinking, the federal government is crucial to economic growth and prosperity. It would direct billions of dollars toward reducing inequities in housing and education, as well as making sure every government agency puts climate change at the front of its agenda. It does not include tax proposals, economic projections or so-called mandatory programs like Social Security, which will all be included in a formal budget request the White House will release this spring. Among its major new spending initiatives, the plan would dedicate an additional $20 billion to help schools that serve low-income children and provide more money to students who have experienced racial or economic barriers to higher education. It would create a multi-billion-dollar program for researching diseases like cancer and add $14 billion to fight and adapt to the damages of climate change. It would also seek to lift the economies of Central American countries, where rampant poverty, corruption and devastating hurricanes have fueled migration toward the southwestern border and a variety of initiatives to address homelessness and housing affordability, including on tribal lands. And it asks for an increase of about 2 percent in spending on national defense. The request represents a sharp break with the policies of President Donald J. Trump, whose budget proposals prioritized military spending and border security, while seeking to cut funding in areas like environmental protection. All told, the proposal calls for a $118 billion increase in discretionary spending in the 2022 fiscal year, when compared with the base spending allocations this year. It seeks to capitalize on the expiration of a decade of caps on spending growth, which lawmakers agreed to in 2010 but frequently breached in subsequent years. Administration officials would not specify on Friday whether that increase would result in higher federal deficits in their coming budget proposal, but promised its full budget would “address the overlapping challenges we face in a fiscally and economically responsible way.” As part of that effort, the request seeks $1 billion in new funding for the Internal Revenue Service to enforce tax laws, including “increased oversight of high-income and corporate tax returns.” That is clearly aimed at raising tax receipts by cracking down on tax avoidance by companies and the wealthy. Officials said the proposals did not reflect the spending called for in Mr. Biden’s infrastructure plan, which he introduced last week, or for a second plan he has yet to roll out, which will focus on what officials call “human infrastructure” like education and child care. Congress, which is responsible for approving government spending, is under no requirement to adhere to White House requests. In recent years, lawmakers rejected many of the Trump administration’s efforts to gut domestic programs. But Mr. Biden’s plan, while incomplete as a budget, could provide a blueprint for Democrats who narrowly control the House and Senate and are anxious to reassert their spending priorities after four years of a Republican White House.

The budget plan boosts funding to prevent future pandemics and stabilize Central American countries. Coronavirus vaccines were administered in New Jersey this month. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times President Biden’s spending plan for foreign programs increases support for two urgent challenges to the United States: curbing the pandemic and addressing a surge in mass migration from Central America. It calls for $10 billion for global health programs — including, notably, $1 billion for security efforts to detect, prevent and respond to future pandemics. Officials said that amounted to a more than $800 million increase for global health security than the United States contributed last year. It also would provide $861 million intended to combat corruption, prevent violence, reduce poverty and bolster economies in Central America in an attempt to curb the flow of thousands of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras who head to the U.S. border with Mexico each year. The money would be the first tranche of a four-year plan to ultimately spend $4 billion to help stabilize those countries and end the migrants’ need to flee. Thematically, the spending plans for the State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development and other foreign programs reflect what Mr. Biden has long promised: to shore up American alliances around the globe. The plans include full funding for United Nations health and human rights agencies, which was withheld under the Trump administration. The plans also cite efforts to counter authoritarian governments, specifically calling out China and Russia, while pledging to fully pay American commitments to longtime Middle East allies, including Israel and Jordan, where King Abdullah II said last week he faced a palace coup. The spending plans also make clear that the Biden administration wants to work with Palestinian leaders on a long-term peace plan with Israel — another departure from the Trump administration, which engaged almost entirely with Israel. Over all, the budget blueprint calls for $63.5 billion for the State Department and international programs — a nearly 12 percent increase from current spending levels of $56.7 billion. Officials said that would also include funds to increase the number of career diplomats and Civil Service employees.

Biden proposes a massive expansion of housing programs for the poor, signaling a big shift in poverty policy. The proposed budget would further the anti-discrimination agenda championed by Marcia L. Fudge, the housing secretary. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden is requesting a $9 billion increase in the budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which would represent the biggest year-to-year boost in the agency’s funding in over two decades. The proposed increase comes on top of the $27.4 billion in new assistance included in the pandemic relief bill passed earlier this year, and the $213 billion slated for housing in the White House infrastructure plan. Although the agency’s proposed funding increase, about 15 percent, is less dramatic than increases given to education and environmental agencies, few departments have seen such a reversal of fortunes under Mr. Biden. Taken as a whole, the White House proposals represent a focused effort to transform an agency relegated to backwater status under President Donald J. Trump into a key player in Mr. Biden’s efforts to target structural racial and economic inequality, administration officials said. The centerpiece of the plan unveiled on Friday is an expansion of federal housing assistance voucher programs, the main conduit for low-income housing funding. The administration is hoping to add an additional 200,000 families to the 2.3 million already receiving the aid. That alone would account for a $5.4 billion increase in H.U.D.’s annual budget. The proposed budget would also further the anti-discrimination agenda championed by Marcia L. Fudge, the housing secretary, by funding “mobility-related supportive services” to make it easier for families to move into more racially, ethnically and economically diverse neighborhoods. The plan also includes $500 million in additional funding for homelessness programs, which would target more than 100,000 additional households, including survivors of domestic violence and homeless youth. That funding is in addition to the $5 billion for emergency housing vouchers already provided in Mr. Biden’s pandemic relief bill. The request would also provide $800 million in new investments across H.U.D. programs for modernization and rehabilitation aimed at energy efficiency and resilience to climate change crises “like increasingly frequent and severe wildfires and floods.” Other increases include a $500 million expansion of the HOME program to construct and rehabilitate affordable rental housing; $180 million to support 2,000 units of new permanently affordable housing for the elderly and disabled; an increase of $295 million for community development block grants used to fund an array of anti-poverty initiatives; and a new $85 million allocation to support fair housing enforcement around the country. H.U.D.’s budget largely flatlined under President Barack Obama, who faced pressure from Republicans to trim social welfare spending. The department languished under Mr. Trump, seeing the mass departure of staff under the wavering leadership of Secretary Ben Carson, a former surgeon with little housing experience. But its budget actually rose during his administration, as congressional Democrats and moderate Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, added billions to the agency’s budget over the objections of Mr. Trump’s budget director, Mick Mulvaney.

The House ethics panel has opened an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Matt Gaetz. Representative Matt Gaetz has denied that he ever had sex with a minor or paid for sex. Credit... Daniel Brenner for The New York Times The House Ethics Committee announced on Friday that it had opened an investigation into a torrent of allegations against Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, including that he broke sex trafficking laws, misused campaign funds and shared graphic images of women with other lawmakers on the House floor. Though the committee shared few details about its work, the scope appeared to be exceedingly broad and overlap with an ongoing Justice Department inquiry into the third-term congressman. In a terse statement disclosing the inquiry, the top Democrat and Republican on the panel wrote that they would seek to determine whether Mr. Gaetz, 38, had violated House rules, the law or “other standards of conduct.” “The committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Matt Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift,” said the joint statement from Representatives Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, and Jackie Walorski, Republican of Indiana. The decision by the ethics panel could further complicate Mr. Gaetz’s attempts to fight the allegations and remain in his House seat. But the committee typically works slowly and poses far less legal or political risk than a Justice Department inquiry. The Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Gaetz broke sex trafficking laws by having sex with a 17-year-old girl in exchange for something of value, and whether he paid adult women for sex, including while under the influence of illicit drugs. Separately, several current and former congressional officials have described to The New York Times and other news outlets incidents in which Mr. Gaetz, a proponent of marijuana legalization, showed up on the House floor smelling of the drug, or shared videos and photos there of women with whom he claimed to be having sex. Mr. Gaetz has denied he ever had sex with a minor or paid for sex. “Once again, the office will reiterate, these allegations are blatantly false and have not been validated by a single human being willing to put their name behind them,” his office said in an unsigned statement on Friday. The ethics panel announced the investigation in one of its customary Friday afternoon news releases, just before issuing another that said it would look into potential sexual misconduct by Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York. In March, a former lobbyist publicly accused Mr. Reed of groping her during a weekend political trip in 2017. Mr. Reed initially denied the accusation, but subsequently apologized and announced he would not seek re-election in 2022. “We have already publicly addressed this situation and consistent with that are cooperating with the House Ethics Committee to bring this matter to conclusion,” Mr. Reed said in a statement on Friday.

Biden will create a commission to study adding seats to the Supreme Court, term limits or other changes. President Biden announced a study will be conducted into adjusting the Supreme Court. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Biden on Friday will order a 180-day study of adding seats to the Supreme Court, making good on a campaign-year promise to establish a bipartisan commission to examine the potentially explosive subjects of expanding the court or setting term limits for justices, White House officials said. The president acted under pressure from activists pushing for more seats to alter the ideological balance of the court after President Donald J. Trump appointed three justices, including one to a seat that Republicans had blocked his predecessor, Barack Obama, from filling for almost a year. The result is a court with a stronger conservative tilt, now 6 to 3, after the addition of Mr. Trump’s choices, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just days before last year’s presidential election. (An earlier version misspelled Justice Ginsburg’s last name.) But while Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has asserted that the system of judicial nominations is “getting out of whack,” he has declined to say whether he supports altering the size of the court or making other changes — like imposing term limits — to the current system of lifetime appointments. It is not clear that the commission established by Mr. Biden will by itself clarify his position. Under the White House order establishing it, the commission is not set to issue specific recommendations at the end of its study — an outcome that is likely to disappoint activists. In his executive order on Friday, the president will create a 36-member commission charged with examining the history of the court, past changes to the process of nominating justices, and the potential consequences to altering the size of the nation’s highest court. The panel will be led by Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel for Mr. Obama, and Cristina Rodriguez, a Yale Law School professor who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Obama. Progressives say that Republicans unfairly gained an advantage on the court by blocking Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland in 2016, and they see adding seats to the court, setting term limits or instituting other changes as a way to offset the power of any one president to influence its makeup. Conservatives have denounced the effort as “court-packing” similar to the failed effort by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s. The issue of whether to alter the size of the court, which has been set at nine members since just after the Civil War, is highly charged, particularly when Congress is almost evenly divided between the two parties. An attempt by Mr. Biden to increase the number of justices would require approval of Congress and would be met by fierce opposition. When asked about the current makeup of the court, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said Friday that Mr. Biden would not ask Justice Stephen G. Breyer, 82, the oldest justice and the senior member of its liberal wing, to step down to ensure a liberal successor. “He believes that’s a decision Justice Breyer will make when he decides it’s time to no longer serve on the Supreme Court,” Ms. Psaki said, adding that Justice Breyer has the “ability to make his own decision.” Michael D.

What does it mean to expand the Supreme Court? The justices of the Supreme Court in 2017, before the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times The idea of expanding the Supreme Court caught fire among some Democrats when the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year ignited a Washington power struggle. As soon as it became clear that the Republican-controlled Senate would almost certainly confirm Justice Amy Coney Barrett, creating a 6-to-3 conservative majority on the court, progressive Democrats — including prominent figures like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — argued that if Democrats won control of the presidency and the Senate in November, they should seriously consider increasing the number of justices. Joseph R. Biden Jr., then the party’s nominee, had long opposed that idea, known as court packing. But after Justice Ginsburg’s death, he said he would establish a bipartisan commission to consider changes to the courts — a broad potential overhaul that could include court packing but also a variety of other measures. “I will ask them to, over 180 days, come back to me with recommendations as to how to reform the court system, because it’s getting out of whack,” Mr. Biden said in an interview with CBS’s “60 Minutes.” Expanding the court is an idea commonly associated with President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who pushed legislation in 1937 that could have broadened the Supreme Court from nine to as many as 15 justices. The history is more complicated than the usual narrative suggests: Mr. Roosevelt, aiming to push older justices to step down, wanted to add a justice to the court for each sitting justice who declined to retire after 70. Today, Democrats characterize court expansion as a defensive move against Republican actions, not as a unilateral power grab. In 2016, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, refused to hold a vote on Merrick B. Garland, now the attorney general and then an appellate judge, who had been nominated to the court by President Barack Obama after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Mr. McConnell held the seat open until after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump, who nominated Justice Neil M. Gorsuch. Many Democrats now say that Justice Gorsuch occupies a seat stolen by Republicans, which has shifted the ideological core of the court. The outrage intensified last year after Justice Ginsburg’s death as Senate Republicans committed to doing what they said was inappropriate in 2016: confirming a justice in an election year. “Let me be clear: If leader McConnell and Senate Republicans move forward with this, then nothing is off the table for next year. Nothing is off the table,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, told his caucus on a phone call late last year. Pete Buttigieg, now the transportation secretary, made the idea a linchpin of his early presidential campaign in 2020. By the end of the race, candidates across the ideological spectrum, including Senators Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker, said court expansion should be explored. Although the Supreme Court has consisted of nine justices for well over a century, the Constitution does not require that number, and Congress changed the size of the court several times between its establishment and the Civil War. That has not stopped Republicans from seeking to weaponize the growing calls for court expansion, particularly as they try to frame Mr. Biden as a political Trojan horse for the Democrats’ left wing.

Pentagon funding is kept flat in Biden’s budget proposal, ruffling doves and hawks alike. The pandemic’s effects on the military are reflected in requests for funding to better monitor emerging infectious diseases. Credit... John Moore/Getty Images President Biden is requesting $715 billion for national defense in his first Pentagon budget, a decrease of about .4 percent when adjusted for inflation, at a time when the White House has signaled a more confrontational approach with Russia and China. The proposed budget for the Defense Department is 1.6 percent higher than the current allocation of $704 billion, in contrast to big funding increases for education, the environment and housing, reflecting Mr. Biden’s focus on domestic spending. Spending on federal agencies besides the Defense Department increased about 16 percent, on average, in the discretionary budget released by the administration on Friday. The defense budget prioritizes China as the Pentagon’s “top challenge” while also seeking to deter what it calls “destabilizing behavior” from Russia. It also places funding for America’s overseas combat operations into the Pentagon’s budget, ending the practice of requesting those funds separately. The request is only the start of what is sure to be a vigorous debate in Congress over how much to spend on defense, and how to allocate it. The plan quickly drew criticism from progressives who wanted to see deep cuts, including Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, who called it “disappointing.” Shortly after the budget was released, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, chairman of the budget committee, told reporters he had “serious concerns” that Mr. Biden had not chosen to scale back a “bloated Pentagon.” Some Republicans expressed the opposite view, accusing Mr. Biden of sacrificing national security to fund liberal programs. “President Biden can find trillions of dollars to pay for his liberal spending sprees but doesn’t prioritize the safety of America and our allies,” Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican who serves on the armed services committee, wrote in a tweet. Several large procurement programs begun by previous administrations have been left in place, such as the effort to modernize America’s nuclear arsenal and build new submarines, as well as the Pentagon’s efforts to create new long-range and hypersonic weapons. In a nod to the reality of climate change, the request notes the need to refurbish military bases in order to make them better able to withstand extreme weather, and to fund energy research that will enable bases to continue operating if their electricity supply is threatened. The pandemic’s consequences on military operations, which include sidelined warships and outbreaks on bases, are addressed in requests for funding to better monitor emerging infectious diseases in cooperation with allies and to develop medical countermeasures. The Pentagon is currently engaged in what it calls a “global posture review” that is assessing which weapons, vehicles, and bases are needed. The budget notes that some existing programs will be defunded, with that money redirected to address the national security challenges identified by the review. John Ismay and

The White House border coordinator will step down. Roberta S. Jacobson said her appointment as a special assistant to the president had always been intended to last for only about 100 days. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Roberta S. Jacobson, the former ambassador to Mexico whom President Biden chose as his “border czar” on the National Security Council, will step down at the end of the month, she said on Friday, even as the administration struggles to confront a surge of migrants at the nation’s southwestern border. Ms. Jacobson, who had been described as one of the Biden administration’s key players in dealing with the governments in the Northern Triangle area of Central America, praised Mr. Biden’s efforts to create a “humane, orderly and safe” immigration system after four years under President Donald J. Trump. “I leave optimistically,” she said. “The policy direction is so clearly right for our country.” Ms. Jacobson said that her appointment as a special assistant to the president and as the border coordinator in the White House had always been intended to last for only about 100 days — a period that will expire at the end of April, when she intends to leave government. The timing of her departure is nonetheless striking, coming in the middle of the administration’s efforts to reduce the flow of immigration from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Ms. Jacobson had been charged with leading that effort when her appointment was announced this year. Republican critics say that Mr. Biden’s decisions to quickly reverse many of the harshest Trump-era immigration policies in his first days in office have encouraged a new wave of migration from Central America, including families and children traveling to the border alone. Biden administration officials, including Ms. Jacobson, have argued that the increased flow of migration needs to be addressed at its source: primarily in Central American countries where violence, war, poverty, gangs and natural disasters are forcing people to flee their homes for refuge in the United States. But her role as one of the administration’s top border officials was eclipsed late last month when Mr. Biden announced that Vice President Kamala Harris would lead the government’s diplomatic efforts with that region. In an interview, Ms. Jacobson said the president’s move to put Ms. Harris in charge of the effort to stem migration from Central America was not a factor in her decision to leave or her timing.

The State Department relaxes limits on contacts with Taiwan. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province that should be reunited with the mainland, and has angrily warned the United States that its support for Taiwan is an interference in China’s internal affairs. Credit... Ritchie B Tongo/EPA, via Shutterstock The State Department announced new regulations on Friday that relax longtime restrictions on what contact U.S. officials may have with counterparts from Taiwan, the latest sign of growing support within the Biden administration for an island democracy facing Chinese intimidation. The shift comes as U.S. officials worry that Beijing may be contemplating an invasion of Taiwan in the coming years, an act that could trigger a conflict with America. Biden administration officials have signaled stronger support for Taiwan and its official representatives, in part to deter potential Chinese aggression. In a statement on Friday, the State Department said that the new guidelines “liberalize guidance on contacts with Taiwan, consistent with our unofficial relations,” and that the shift “reflects our deepening unofficial relationship” with Taiwan. State Department officials did not provide further details on the changes. Top U.S. officials already have substantial contact with Taiwan’s representatives in Washington. Kurt Campbell, the National Security Council’s coordinator for the Indo-Pacific region, and Laura Rosenberger, the N.S.C.’s senior director for China, have met regularly with Taiwan’s representative to the U.S., Bi-khim Hsiao. Ms. Hsiao also attended Mr. Biden’s inauguration, the first time Taiwan’s official representative formally represented the island at a presidential swearing-in since the 1970s. Under America’s “One China” policy, which dates to President Richard M. Nixon’s diplomatic opening with China, Washington supports Taiwan but does not recognize it as independent. Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway province that should be reunited with the mainland, and angrily warns the United States that its support for Taiwan — and any diplomatic contacts that lend credibility to the idea of its independence — is interference in China’s internal affairs. The guidelines were established after the U.S. broke ties with the government of Taiwan, which was formed by Chinese nationalists who retreated to the island after China’s 1949 communist revolution. They have gradually been relaxed since then, and the Trump administration took numerous steps to bolster Taiwan’s diplomatic status short of recognizing its independence. The shift comes as U.S. officials and foreign policy analysts are debating whether Washington should make a more explicit commitment to the defense of Taiwan against a possible Chinese attack. Under a current policy dictated by Congress in 1979, the U.S. considers that “any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means” would be of “grave concern,” but does not explicitly pledge to defend Taiwan militarily. Congress mandated a review of the State Department regulations with the Taiwan Assurance Act, which became law last December. In January, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lifted the guidelines entirely, leaving a void that the new guidelines will fill.

Talks in Vienna on reviving the Iran nuclear deal will continue next week. The Grand Hotel in Vienna this week, where diplomats from the European Union, China, Russia and Iran held talks on the Iran nuclear deal. Credit... Joe Klamar/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Talks in Vienna aimed at reinvigorating the Iran nuclear deal that the Trump administration left in 2018 and which Tehran began breaking a year later made some progress this week: They didn’t break down. Senior diplomats involved in the talks agreed on Friday that initial steps in two working groups designed to bring both the United States and Iran back into compliance with the accord were positive and would continue next week. Although there are no direct talks between Iran and the United States, the other signatories to the deal — Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia, under the chairmanship of the European Union — are engaging in a kind of shuttle diplomacy between them. One working group is focusing on how to lift the harsh economic sanctions that the United States imposed that are inconsistent with the terms of the nuclear deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or J.C.P.O.A. The other working group is focusing on how Iran can return to the limits on enriched uranium and the centrifuges to produce it under the terms of the deal. Mikhail Ulyanov, the Russian representative to the talks in Vienna, said in a Twitter message after Friday’s meeting that “participants took stock of the work done by experts over the last three days and noted with satisfaction the initial progress made.” The senior diplomats who meet in what is known as the Joint Commission — representing all signatories except the United States — will reconvene next week “in order to maintain the positive momentum,” Mr. Ulyanov said. U.S. officials have worked to play down expectations for any quick breakthrough and have urged patience. In what has been perceived as a gesture of good will, Iran on Friday released a South Korean oil tanker that had been held since January in a dispute over billions of dollars seized by Seoul after the United States enacted punishing sanctions.

161,Biden Creating Commission to Study Expanding the Supreme Court,"It is not clear that the commission established by Mr. Biden will by itself clarify his position. Under the White House order establishing it, the commission is not set to issue specific recommendations at the end of its study — an outcome that is likely to disappoint activists.

In his executive order on Friday, the president created a 36-member commission charged with examining the history of the court, past changes to the process of nominating justices, and the potential consequences to altering the size of the nation’s highest court.

The panel will be led by Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel for Mr. Obama, and Cristina Rodriguez, a Yale Law School professor who served as deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel under Mr. Obama.

Progressives say that Republicans unfairly gained an advantage on the court by blocking Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland in 2016, and they see adding seats to the court, setting term limits or instituting other changes as a way to offset the power of any one president to influence its makeup. Conservatives have denounced the effort as “court-packing” similar to the failed effort by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s.

The issue of whether to alter the size of the court, which has been set at nine members since just after the Civil War, is highly charged, particularly when Congress is almost evenly divided between the two parties. An attempt by Mr. Biden to increase the number of justices would require approval of Congress and would be met by fierce opposition.",0
162,White House Border Coordinator to Step Down,"WASHINGTON — Roberta S. Jacobson, the former ambassador to Mexico whom President Biden chose as his “border czar” on the National Security Council, will step down at the end of the month, she said on Friday, even as the administration struggles to confront a surge of migrants at the nation’s southwestern border.

Ms. Jacobson, who had been described as one of the Biden administration’s key players in dealing with the governments in the Northern Triangle area of Central America, praised what she called Mr. Biden’s efforts to repair and recast the nation’s immigration system after four years under President Donald J. Trump.

“They continue to drive toward the architecture that the president has laid out: an immigration system that is humane, orderly and safe,” she said in a brief interview. “I leave optimistically. The policy direction is so clearly right for our country.”

Ms. Jacobson said that her appointment as a special assistant to the president and as the border coordinator in the White House was always intended to last for only about 100 days — a period that will expire at the end of April, when she intends to leave government.",0
163,"Derek Chauvin Trial Live Updates: Drugs and Heart Disease Were ‘Not Direct Causes’ of Floyd’s Death, Medical Examiner Says","Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, testified on Friday in Derek Chauvin’s murder trial that George Floyd died from low oxygen caused by law enforcement’s subdual restraint and compression to the neck.

“Well, I was asked to review a lot of the materials and come to an independent conclusion about what I thought the cause, and manner of death were and the mechanism for that cause. I’ve never had a case like this that had such thorough documentation of the terminal events?” “And by way of the thorough documentation, what makes it so thorough, in your opinion?” “Well, the use of videos is unique in this case. Certainly as medical examiners we use videos, but there’s never been a case that I’ve been involved with that had videos over such a long time frame, and from so many different perspectives.” “Do you agree with Dr. Baker’s determination on the cause of death?” “Yes, I do.” “And is that by the word ‘immediate’ on here?” “Yes, cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement’s subdual restraint and neck compression.” “Have you, Dr. Thomas, formed an opinion about the mechanism of death?” “Yes.” “Would you tell us what that is?” “In this case, I believe the primary mechanism of death is asphyxia or low oxygen. So, this is not a sudden cardiac death, a sudden cardiac arrhythmia. This is a death where both the heart and lungs stopped working. And the point is that it’s due to law enforcement’s subdual restraint and compression. It basically is Mr. Floyd was in a position because of the subdual restraint and compression, where he was unable to get enough oxygen in to maintain his body functions.”

A forensic pathologist testified on Friday that George Floyd had primarily died of low oxygen, also called asphyxia, which she said had been caused by Derek Chauvin and the other police officers who pressed him to the ground.

The testimony from Dr. Lindsey C. Thomas further supported prosecutors’ arguments that Mr. Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who is on trial for murder, killed Mr. Floyd by kneeling on him for more than nine minutes.

Exactly what caused Mr. Floyd’s death last May has become a central issue in the second week of the trial; Mr. Chauvin’s lawyer has suggested that Mr. Floyd could have died from a heart condition or the fentanyl and methamphetamine that were found in his system.

Dr. Thomas has worked in several medical examiner’s offices over 36 years and said she had performed at least 5,000 autopsies. She also helped to train Dr. Andrew Baker, the current Hennepin County medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Mr. Floyd and who was also scheduled to testify on Friday.

She said she agreed with Dr. Baker’s finding that Mr. Floyd’s death was a homicide and that the cause was “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement’s subdual restraint and neck compression.”

That phrase had caused some confusion in the months after it was issued, and Mr. Chauvin’s lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, asked Dr. Thomas on Friday if “complicating” could mean different things to different experts; she agreed. But Dr. Thomas said that in this case, she found it to mean that Mr. Floyd’s heart had stopped because of the police officers’ actions.

“Mr. Floyd was in a position, because of the subdual, restraint and compression, where he was unable to get enough oxygen in to maintain his body functions,” Dr. Thomas testified.

She said that physiological stress could be considered a secondary mechanism of Mr. Floyd’s death, after the primary mechanism of asphyxia, but that both were caused by the police officers who pinned Mr. Floyd to the ground.

Dr. Thomas’s testimony came the day after a lung doctor also said that Mr. Floyd had died of a lack of oxygen caused by Mr. Chauvin’s pressure on his neck and back. Mr. Nelson is expected to call his own experts later in the trial after prosecutors rest their case. Dr. Thomas, like other experts called by prosecutors, rebutted the defense’s argument that drugs could have caused Mr. Floyd’s death.

“There’s no evidence to suggest he would have died that night, except for the interactions with law enforcement,” Dr. Thomas said.

During her testimony, a prosecutor provided autopsy photographs of Mr. Floyd’s body, hands, shoulders and face to jurors, but they were not shown publicly. Dr. Thomas used the photographs to show and describe scrapes on Mr. Floyd’s hands that she said had come from the handcuffs.

In his cross-examination, Mr. Nelson asked her several questions about Mr. Floyd’s heart, which was larger than average, and also asked her about hypothetical situations.

“You find a person at home, no struggle with the police, the person doesn’t have a heart problem,” Mr. Nelson said, laying out a hypothetical situation. “If you find fentanyl and methamphetamine in this person’s system at the levels that they are at, would you certify this as an overdose?”

Dr. Thomas responded: “Again, in the absence of these other realities, yes, I could consider that to be an overdose.”

But Dr. Thomas said the autopsy had ruled out various other causes of death, including a heart attack, and that Dr. Baker’s labeling of the death as a homicide had ruled out an overdose on drugs, which would almost always be described as an accident. Nothing in an autopsy alone would prove that Mr. Floyd had died of low oxygen, she said; for that reason, she said, the videos of Mr. Floyd’s death were vital to her analysis.

In another exchange, Mr. Nelson asked Dr. Thomas about a study in Canada that analyzed about 3,000 situations in which a suspect was placed in a prone position by police. Mr. Nelson asked Dr. Thomas if she was aware that no one in that study had died.

“Isn’t that amazing?” Dr. Thomas responded. “When you consider that virtually every forensic pathologist in the United States has probably had an officer-involved death like this, how did they — it utterly baffles me — which is why I kept saying ‘Canada,’ because I don’t know what’s different, but —”

At that point, Mr. Nelson objected and Dr. Thomas was cut off.",0
165,Key Moments on Day 10 of the Derek Chauvin Trial,"The trial of the former officer Derek Chauvin will end its second week on Friday after testimony from several witnesses about George Floyd’s precise cause of death. Mr. Floyd was pinned to the ground for more than nine minutes by Mr. Chauvin’s knee; prosecutors are arguing that he died from asphyxia, while the defense says that drugs in his system may be the cause.

Here are some key takeaways from recent testimony.

Police officers, not drugs, caused George Floyd’s death, a pathologist testified.

166,"Prince Philip, Husband of Queen Elizabeth II, Is Dead at 99","Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, father of Prince Charles and patriarch of a turbulent royal family that he sought to ensure would not be Britain’s last, died on Friday at Windsor Castle in England. He was 99.

His death was announced by Buckingham Palace, which said he passed away peacefully.

Philip had been hospitalized several times in recent years for various ailments, most recently in February, the palace said.

He died just as Buckingham Palace was again in turmoil, this time over Oprah Winfrey’s explosive televised interview last month with Philip’s grandson Prince Harry and Harry’s wife, Meghan. The couple, in self-imposed exile in California, lodged accusations of racism and cruelty against members of the royal family.

As “the first gentleman in the land,” Philip tried to shepherd into the 20th century a monarchy encrusted with the trappings of the 19th. But as pageantry was upstaged by scandal, as regal weddings were followed by sensational divorces, his mission, as he saw it, changed. Now it was to help preserve the crown itself.",0
167,Prince Philip’s Life in Pictures,"Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II and the longest-serving consort in British history, was born into Greek royalty in the 1920s, served on a battleship in World War II, toured the world on royal missions for decades and sought for most of his life to defend the interests of Britain’s monarchy.

His life spanned almost a century of upheaval and change for Britain: As a child, he lived with a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and he died nearly 100 years old, survived by great grandchildren who will grow up in an era of smartphones and the internet.

Philip came to England after his father, Prince Andrew of Greece, was banished by a revolutionary Greek junta. He was educated at the Cheam School, an institution bent on toughening privileged children, and then went to Gordonstoun School in Scotland, which promoted a regimen of grueling work, cold showers and hard beds.

He met Princess Elizabeth when she was about 13 or 14. She was instantly smitten, telling her father, King George VI, that she could love no other man but him. They married on Nov. 20, 1947, when he was 26 and she was 21.",0
168,"DMX, a Profound Vessel for Pain","From the release of his debut Def Jam single, “Get at Me Dog,” in 1998, DMX was an immediate titanic presence in hip-hop. Just as the genre was moving toward polished sheen, he preferred iron and concrete — rapping with a muscular throatiness that conveyed an excitable kind of mayhem. The staccato bursts on “Ruff Ryders’ Anthem” — an early Swizz Beatz masterpiece — matched DMX’s jabs of melancholy: “All I know is pain/All I feel is rain.”

His voice was unrelentingly coarse, and in his peak era, between 1998 and 2003, he used it for one chest-puffed anthem after another: “Party Up (Up in Here),” “What’s My Name?,” “Who We Be,” “X Gon’ Give It to Ya,” “Where the Hood At?” Often, he rapped as if he were trying to win an argument, with repetitive emphasis and terse phrasing designed for maximum impact. Even when he dipped into flirtation, like on “What These Bitches Want,” he didn’t change his approach.

But when he took on his own troubled past on “Slippin’,” he tempered himself just a bit, as if showing himself some grace:

They put me in a situation forcing me to be a man

When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand, damn

Was it my fault, something I did

To make a father leave his first kid? At 7 doing my first bid

Even though DMX’s time at the top of the genre was relatively brief, just a few ferocious years, he was never erased from its collective memory. That’s partly because the tumult of his personal life constantly landed him in the spotlight — he was arrested dozens of times, for charges including drug possession, aggravated assault, driving without a license and tax evasion. He rescued stray dogs, and tattooed a tribute to one of his dogs, Boomer, across the whole of his back, but also pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges.

But he remained a subject of sympathy: DMX was a wild man, and a broken one, too. Physically abused by his mother as a child, he spent significant stretches of time in group homes. He took to crime young, specializing in robbery. Many of the stories contained in his 2002 book, “E.A.R.L.: The Autobiography of DMX,” are matter of fact and harrowing.",0
169,"DMX, Top-Selling but Troubled Rapper, Dies at 50","Earl Simmons, the snarling yet soulful rapper known as DMX, who had a string of No. 1 albums in the late 1990s and early 2000s but whose personal struggles eventually rivaled his lyrical prowess, died on Friday in White Plains, N.Y. He was 50.

His family announced the death in a statement. He had been on life support at White Plains Hospital after suffering what his family called “a catastrophic cardiac arrest” a week earlier.

“Earl was a warrior who fought till the very end,” the Simmons family said. “He loved his family with all of his heart, and we cherish the times we spent with him.”

On April 2, Mr. Simmons had a heart attack at his home in White Plains. In the days that followed, his representatives said he was on life support “in a vegetative state.” Outside of the hospital, family and friends gathered with hundreds of fans, playing DMX’s music aloud and praying, holding up their arms in the shape of an X.",0
170,DMX: Hear 10 Essential Songs,"Earl Simmons, the gruff, evocative rapper from Yonkers, N.Y., better known as DMX, died on Friday at 50. He spent his final days on life support at White Plains Hospital in Westchester County after suffering a heart attack on April 2.

DMX was one of the most recognizable M.C.s in the late 1990s and early 2000s, years when hardcore New York rap could still stake a claim as hip-hop’s central concern.

Signed to Def Jam Recordings, his first five albums all debuted at No. 1, a feat no rapper has matched before or since. DMX cut a unique figure for a superstar rapper: He’d battle his inner demons using the horror-centric imagery beloved by heavy metal bands, but his albums reliably offered heartfelt, often a cappella, prayers to God. He made giant pop crossover hits, but they bubbled with wildly vivid threats better suited for a grindhouse theater. His shout-rap energy made him a favorite in the outwardly angsty era of Woodstock ’99 and the nü-metal band Korn’s Family Values Tour, but he was also a shirtless sex symbol moonlighting as an actor.",0
171,Can This Amusement Park Be Saved?,"“This was brought to my attention by a ride supplier of ours who was like, ‘Maybe you should take a look,’” he said. Reading the park’s history online and taking a spin through some local Facebook groups were enough to get him on a plane. “The minute I saw it in person, I knew we needed to do it. I’ve never been there before, but it reminded me of where I grew up.”

Mr. Staples wasn’t in the market for a second amusement park, and certainly not one 750 miles from the first, but on the drive into town, as the water slides rose into view, he was already sold.

“It goes back to Kiddieland,” he said. “It was a tragedy that it was lost, and to see that happen again, to somebody else’s park, is an American tragedy. People tend to tell me about their home amusement parks. Maybe they’re not perfect, but to you, they’re magic. You think it’s just you, but it’s not.”

He and the teenagers climbed onto the carousel. They pulled the worn canvas cover up where it dragged on the ground and clipped it back into place, like giving the ride back its dignity.

“Amusement park rides to me are like kinetic sculptures,” Mr. Staples said. “Especially the vintage rides. They’re beautiful pieces of history — machines you have to keep up, keep painted, put love into. The mentality in America is, ‘This looks rundown, let’s replace it.’ But you learn over time that keeping what you have is what keeps people coming back.”

On inspection day, hearing that I’d grown up in this town, a woman examining a deep fryer asked if I was sad to see the park like this. It was hard to answer, because of course I saw the stillness and decay; but I could also see it just as it was, lit up and full of life.",0
172,Tina Brown: Prince Philip Walked Two Paces Behind the Queen - The New York Times,"In return, she provided Philip with an emotional safe place his childhood lacked. Though his eye was rumored to rove, his devotion to the queen cannot be questioned. He completed more than 22,000 royal engagements on his own and accompanied the queen on all of her overseas tours. (“Don’t jostle the queen!” he would sometimes bark if the press got too close.)

He made comments that ranged from impolitic (“Your country is one of the most notorious centers of trading in endangered species,” he told his affronted hosts when accepting a conservation award in Thailand in 1991) to offensive (“Do you still throw spears at each other?” he asked Aboriginal elders on a trip with the queen to Australia in 2002). But the queen’s poker face in public was no guide to how she might have dryly chided him in private.

The marriage succeeded on strategy as much as love. The queen’s marital challenge was how to harness her husband’s prodigious energies in the service of the crown. The key to that was to avoid making him feel unmanned. There was a difficult passage in the early years, when he learned that his children would take the dynastic Windsor name, not his own. And there were few models then for how to build a marriage in which the balance of power was so entirely weighted toward a wife, unless you count Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

With her customary quiet savviness, the queen found sly ways to manage her husband while she got on with weighty matters of state. She put him in charge of all the royal estates and houses, which he oversaw — as the queen mother put it sourly — like a “German junker,” and she deputed to him the big family decisions.

Elizabeth encouraged activities that made Philip feel autonomous: flying, polo, carriage driving. He drove a four-horse carriage around Windsor Great Park at the age of 97. He had a passion for technology. In more recent years, I am told, he extolled the joys of his Kindle until, disgusted by all the direct marketing of books he didn’t want to read, he threw it in the bath.",0
173,Trump’s Corporate Tax Cut Was a Flop - The New York Times,"A tax on profits isn’t a tax on capital

I’ve been spending some time talking to tax policy experts inside and outside the Biden administration, and one point they make is that what might seem obvious — taxing profits deters corporations from investments they might otherwise make — isn’t obvious at all.

Imagine a company considering whether to borrow money to invest in some new project. If there were no profits tax, it would proceed if and only if it expected the rate of return on the project to exceed the interest rate on the loan. Now suppose that there is, say, a 35 percent tax on profits. How does this change the company’s decision? It doesn’t.

Why? Because interest on the loan is tax-deductible. If investment is financed with debt, profit taxes only fall on returns over and above the interest rate, which means that they shouldn’t affect investment choices.

OK, not all investment is debt-financed, although that itself poses a puzzle: There’s a clear tax advantage to issuing debt rather than selling stock, and the question of why companies don’t use more leverage is subtle and hard. The immediate point, however, is that the corporate profits tax isn’t a tax on capital, it’s a tax on a particular aspect of corporate financial structure. Analyses — mine included! — that treat it simply as raising the cost of capital are being far too generous to tax cutters.

Business investment isn’t that sensitive to the cost of capital, anyway

Suppose we ignore the deductibility of interest for a moment, and consider a company that for some reason finances all its investment with equity. Imagine also that investors know they can earn a rate of return r in the global marketplace. In that case they’ll require that the company earn r/ (1-t) on its investments, where t is the rate of profit taxes. This is how advocates of the Trump tax cut looked at the world in 2017.

Under these conditions, cutting t, by reducing the required rate of return — in effect, by cutting the cost of capital — should induce corporations to increase the U.S. capital stock. For example, the Tax Foundation predicted that the capital stock would rise by 9.9 percent, or more than $6 trillion.

But these predictions missed a key point: most business assets are fairly short-lived. Equipment and software aren’t like houses, which have a useful life measured in decades if not generations. They’re more like cars, which generally get replaced after a few years — in fact, most business investment is even less durable than cars, generally wearing out or becoming obsolete quite fast.",0
174,Opinion | Republicans’ Fake War Against ‘Woke Capital’,"Similarly, Republicans and conservatives could work to end “at will” employment, in which workers can be fired for any reason. If American corporations have been captured by activists eager to “cancel” dissenters, then workers need robust protections in the event they run afoul of an overzealous human resources department or some “woke” Walmart commissar.

A higher federal minimum wage and a more robust social safety net would also work to strengthen employees vis-à-vis their employers. The less an individual worker needs to rely on market income to survive, the more he or she can pick and choose between jobs. The more corporations have to spend on recruiting and retaining workers, the less they can spend on influencing politics.

If “woke capital” is a real problem, then it’s a labor issue as much as it is a cultural one. And there are many other policies — antitrust regulations against tech companies, “co-determination” to give workers a seat at the corporate table and strict limits on corporate political spending, to name just a few — that would curb the power of corporations to impose their values on both their employees and the broader public.

We know, of course, that Republicans aren’t interested in any of this. McConnell might denounce actual corporate speech, but he is a major recipient of corporate dollars and a staunch defender of corporate spending in elections. (He has already backed off on his comments. “I didn’t say that very artfully,” he explained the next day.) Neither Rubio nor Hawley has ever met a corporate tax cut he couldn’t support, and the entire Republican Party is united in support of an anti-labor politics that puts ordinary workers at the mercy of capital.

Recall Senator Mitt Romney’s critique of the White House’s relief package from February: “The Biden stimulus calls for checks of $400 a week in addition to state checks through September. At that level, the majority of the unemployed would make more by not working. Employers already complain that they can’t find employees.”

Republican “woke capital” critics are not actually interested in curbing corporate influence and putting power in the hands of workers. They don’t have a problem with corporate speech as a matter of principle. They have a problem with corporate speech as a matter of politics. If the situation were reversed, and corporations were vocal supporters of “election integrity,” it’s hard to imagine that McConnell or his allies would have a problem.

“Woke” capital also does not actually exist. A Black Lives Matter advertisement does not make up for the McDonald’s exploitative relationship to labor and the environment. Amazon might take a few items deemed offensive off its shelves, but it still relies on overworked and underpaid workers in its warehouses and delivery vehicles.

Capital is capital, and, culture war agitation notwithstanding, the Republican Party is more than willing to back its interests when it matters most.

175,Opinion | The Best Explanation of Biden’s Thinking I’ve Heard,"[MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

I’m Ezra Klein, and this is “The Ezra Klein Show.” I have covered Joe Biden for decades now. I covered him as a senator. I covered him as a vice president. I covered him as a participant in the Democratic Party, searching traumatized post-Trump debates about which direction to go. And I covered him twice as a presidential candidate. And I thought I had a pretty good handle on him. But I would not have predicted this presidency. I would not have predicted these bills. The American Rescue Plan was a $1.9 trillion bill that erred really heavily on the side of doing more. That is not, I would say, a hallmark of Joe Biden’s career up until now. But maybe you could say, well, it’s a coronavirus emergency. That changed everything. Well, coronavirus doesn’t explain the $2 trillion American Jobs Plan that just came out. This is not a coronavirus bill. It is not fixing problems caused by a pandemic. This is a searing critique of the pre-pandemic economy. Its provisions amount to an argument that the economy we had before the pandemic. It was a calamity for people and for the planet. The status quo ante was a disaster. And by implication, Democrats very much, including Joe Biden, who had a hand in building it, had been too slow to recognize its problems and much too timid in facing them. I like to say that every president is an emergent property. When you take that office, you become more than just yourself. You become a complex system. That includes your staff, your party, the opposition party, the moment the public chants geopolitical realities and so much more. But out of all that, the president and his staff, they have to fashion a philosophy, a coherent account of what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. And frankly, I have wanted a better account than the one we’ve gotten, one that goes beyond coronavirus and beyond Joe Biden’s much more moderate primary positioning to account for the ambition we’ve seen. Brian Deese is director of Joe Biden’s National Economic Council. He was a young economic policy prodigy in the Obama administration. He helped run the auto bailout. Then he turned to focus on climate, both in the Obama White House and then at BlackRock. And when Biden brought him back to run the National Economic Council, which is really powerful — it’s the nerve center of economic policymaking in the executive branch — that was a message. It was a message, if for one thing, in the Biden administration, all economics was going to be climate economics. So I asked Brian to come on the show to walk me through the American Jobs Plan and the way his thinking and the way Biden’s thinking have changed since 2009. And why? Now, look, I always worry when I have a public official I’m not going to say anything. They’ll just dodge the questions and give me a lot of pablum. That didn’t happen here. Brian was a lot more forthcoming than I feared. So I left, and I think you will, too, with a much better understanding of why the combination of forces we refer to as Joe Biden is taking the shape we now see. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Here is Brian Deese. [MUSIC PLAYING] So in 2009 — I want to go all the way back there — the stimulus, it got sold as timely, temporary, and targeted. And there was some long-term investment in there. But there was this idea that what we were trying to do is accelerate recovery back to the pre-crisis economic trends. And what’s happening now in the Biden administration seems to be more fundamentally an argument that the pre-crisis economy was sort of a disaster for both people and the planet. Is that right?

brian deese

I think that that is a pretty fair reflection. I think that implicit in the slogan that the president coined on the campaign of Build Back Better was this notion that even as we were in the middle of a totally unique crisis, that we had to be thinking forward to fundamental challenges in the economy and how we were going to overcome them. And I think that you put your finger on two of them, one of which is this sort of growing economic inequality that the rate of growth persisted over the course of a couple of decades but really sort of exacerbated and was laid bare during the pandemic. And the other is climate change that we’ve also seen the impact accelerating. And I think that in the president’s view and in our view, having an economic strategy that is unresponsive or agnostic to those issues is no longer a viable option.

So these bills — the rescue plan, the jobs plan, the coming family plan — they’re always built on both a mix of political and economic theory. So I want to go through this part. What have you changed your mind on politically since 2009?

brian deese

Well, certainly one of the important things politically is making sure that the ultimate recipients, the ultimate beneficiaries of the things you are trying to accomplish, no one understands and appreciate what you’re trying to accomplish for them. Some of that gets distilled down into complexity versus simplicity, but I think another of it is the willingness to see what we’re trying to accomplish in terms of making sure people understand what is going on. And certainly, one of the things in 2009 that when I was involved I thought was sort of virtue was this sense in which we were really focused on the task at hand and the idea of selling or explaining or being out on the road interacting with the ultimate end beneficiaries, whether it be a small business or whether it be a community organization or a family. That was the politics of it. And now, I think that that’s more inextricably the policy of it. Because your ability to sustain good policy is connected to your ability to sustain political support for that good policy.

ezra klein

And let me drill on that for a minute because I think this helps illuminate a debate that happened, particularly with the rescue plan and the checks, which is that there were economists, and some of them including the former guy who held your position, Larry Summers, who argued they were not well targeted. They were going to people who weren’t suffering. And there’s another group who said even if they’re not perfectly targeted, there’s a trade off here where they’re popular. People are going to know they’re getting them. They’re going to get a sense that they’re being helped by the administration, and that’s going to generate political momentum. Should I understand that as a trade off that is a new one this administration is making?

brian deese

I think there’s a couple of things there to unpack. One of them is that the policy rationale and the policy goal is different, or at least we understand it to be different, that the goal of providing relief is more akin to post-natural disaster, how do you bridge people to when life is going to return to some semblance of normal if you look at what the rescue plan was designed to do with respect to the checks or, frankly, with respect to support to small businesses. In the current crisis, we are providing loans that turnover to become grants, basically grant funding to bridge a small business — analytically very different than the kind of approach that was taken in 2009. And that reflects a view that this is more about bridging relief, avoiding suffering. The second thing that you’re getting at, though, is kind of the direct salience of understanding that this is a benefit that people are getting and that they can rally around. And I think there was a salience to that, and there continues to be a salience to that that this definition of what it means to be hurting is broader and more universal than the idea of viewing people as pass-throughs or increments of fiscal stimulus. The question of the multiplier and how much of that unit is going to get spent out over a month is less the answer to the question than even if you’re a two-earner family and you’ve retained your job during this crisis, life is very hard right now. It’s more costly in ways that are important to the way people are experiencing their life, even if it doesn’t fit into an output-gap multiplier analysis. So that’s a piece of it, too.

ezra klein

Yeah, and I will say, viewing people as pass-throughs for units of incremental stimulus is one of the truly great sentences of economics I have ever heard, and I honor you for it. How about economically? What have you changed your mind on economically about the state of the economy or what kinds of economic policies make sense since 2009?

brian deese

A couple of things. One is since 2009, both the evidence and my understanding of the impact of climate change have affected my view of the importance of understanding how to reflect resilience to the inevitable and now irreversible changes that increasing global average temperatures are having on our society, but also the importance of building into everything we’re doing mitigating those impacts. That’s number one. Number two is that our economy is becoming more unequal. And so the distributional consequences of fiscal policy, in particular, have become more resonant to me. If you look at the averages in this crisis, you almost look through almost all of the pronounced economic damage that’s happening. And so in that context, this crisis, but even the run into this crisis, has made me more attuned to and more attentive to the ways in which economic policy that is sort of agnostic to distributional impacts and agnostic to the growth impacts of economic inequality likely fails to actually address the moment. And I guess the last piece, maybe we’ll get there. This is sort of going off in a different direction to some degree. But the global economic situation has changed. China is in a very different place than it was a decade ago. We are in a different place, vis-a-vis our international competitors. And my openness to and appetite to and emphasis that I would place on more targeted efforts to try to build domestic industrial strength, the things that people in prior eras would demean or mock as industrial policy, has increased because I think we are not operating on a level playing field. There’s not a market-based solution to try to address some of the big weaknesses that we’re seeing open up in our economy when we’re dealing with competitors like China that are not operating on market-based terms. That’s, for me at least, a change in perspective from where I was a decade ago.

ezra klein

You’re right that that is lower in where I wanted to go in this conversation, but let’s do it now. Because I expected the focus on climate in this plan, and I did not expect the focus on China in the framing and even policy design of this plan. So tell me more about why your thinking, the administration’s thinking has changed on this since ‘09. China was not market based in many ways in 2009. There is a different ideological current in the Democratic coalition around China right now and a different sense of what policy makes sense. So why? What has structurally changed here?

brian deese

Well, I want to start there by saying a lot of this comes directly from how the president is thinking about the current moment and the direction that he’s providing to us. When we think about infrastructure, and he’s thinking about the infrastructure investments necessary, a lot of it is in contra position to what he is seeing China doing, in terms of strategic investments. So China has gotten high-speed rail right, where the United States has not. China is increasing its strategic R&D as a share of its economy, as a share of whatever metric you want to use in a way that we have let deteriorate. And so the thing that has changed is that we’ve lived through a decade where China has been meticulously thinking about making those investments, marshaling those investments — not all successful, but all with a deliberate focus on trying to build its own industrial base and its own intellectual and innovation base. And we have, for the better part of a decade, ignored or derogated and undermined those levers. So whatever argument there was for making those investments a decade ago are more pertinent now. But I think the second element of it is that on the wake of the last four years that we lived through, the thing that has surprised, I think, many of us is coming in and understanding that among our allies and among our global counterparts, there is a big question about, can the United States deliver for its own citizens? Can the United States competently govern and invest in things that are obviously beneficial to its own welfare, its economic strength, its economic resilience? Because the world has watched now for a couple of years where the United States operated in a way that was very difficult for our international counterparts to fathom. And they didn’t expect the United States to do things that it did over the last couple of years. And that is really now a dominant question. I think now, more than any time in modern history, the world is watching U.S domestic policy and U.S domestic economic policy. This question of whether or not the rescue plan would pass was sort of a top question at the G7. And I think that that reflects the fact that the world is asking this question, if the US is going to lead again internationally on an issue like climate change or an issue like global health and pandemic response to this pandemic and future pandemics, first and foremost, the question is, can the US get its house in order? And that question is inevitably framed vis-a-vis China.

ezra klein

Why frame questions in terms of China and what they’re doing? We don’t think too much about how much the UK or Germany or Malaysia or Brazil are spending on R&D. We don’t think that much about the strategic investments they are making. Why frame things in context of China? Why are they the relevant comparator?

brian deese

They are the ascendant economic and military power in the world. And so for geopolitical and economic reasons, their economic strength and their national security strength will loom larger than others. I think that that’s number one. Number two is because of the investments that they have made, they’ve positioned themselves in a number of critical areas to our global economy and to supply chains as a critical actor and one in which, as we think about the competitive dynamics with China, we need to ask ourselves a more serious set of questions about our own vulnerability. I would also say, to your question, it’s not just China, and this isn’t just a great power dynamic between the US and China. It’s also that this pandemic has exposed for us, in the US, the vulnerability of our economy and our supply chains to an unrestrained globalized economy as well, where the supply chain vulnerabilities often are connected to China but are connected in very complicated ways, you know? The semiconductor shortage we have in the United States today is a complicated story that involves lots of countries and lots of elements of the supply chain and where your second-tier supplier sits in Europe, even if the ultimate place where the wafer is being manufactured is in Asia. That’s a reality of the global economy, but those realities are creating vulnerabilities for the US economy that I think have been more difficult to see, or at least people haven’t focused as much on them until something like this pandemic happens and exposes us so viscerally.

ezra klein

I want to touch back to something else you were talking about a minute ago, which is political risk, that this wouldn’t pass the concern that can American government still deliver for its own people. One thing that seems to me to have changed in the past 10, 15 years in particularly Democratic economic politics, is a sense of the risks of economic policy are not just economic. They are political. One of your colleagues said something to me that has rung in my head. It’s like an iconic quote to me, which is that, now he’s speaking of your administration, if people don’t see we’re helping the shit out of them, this country could be back to Donald Trump or something like him very soon. Is there a different sense of the interaction here between economics, the sense people have of the government working, and what the range of political outcomes for America are?

brian deese

I think that there’s definitely a sense of the stakes, that we just lived through four years of Donald Trump, which certainly raises the stakes for making sure that we can effectively deliver and never go back to that again. But we’re also living through this pandemic, which has exacerbated a lot of weaknesses in the economy, but also upended so much of what we took for granted a stable elements of our economy and our life. And we are at a critical moment internationally as well for the reasons we just discussed. So for all those reasons, I think that there is a heightened sense of the stakes and also, I would say, on the positive side, a sense of the opportunity. We do see, historically, that these moments of crises are moments where the potential spectrum of possibilities expands and that in a moment like this, there’s a unique opportunity. But to connect it back to the point you were raising, our view is that making sure that we maintain this thread that President Biden has been pretty consistent on since before the election, that he is focused on the things that matter most to working people in the country. And when he says he’s laser-focused on COVID and the economy, that is a political message. He is a political actor. But it is deeply rooted in his understanding and our understanding of what matters most in people’s lives right now and making sure that they understand that when we’re taking actions, it’s connected. We may fail. We may make mistakes. We will try to be very upfront about that when it happens. But it’s in service of trying to actually address those issues that matter most in their lives. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

How has negotiating with the congressional Democratic caucus changed since 2009 to ‘10?

brian deese

Well, I think the politics of the country and the politics of the Democratic Party have changed, and there is a different aspiration and expectation for what we were elected to do. And I think that the president had a lot to do with that, in terms of the campaign that he ran and the vision that he outlined for the country. But I also think that even with the slim majorities that we have, the Democratic caucus as a whole is focused on delivering on that agenda, which is big and ambitious. And as a result, the pressure on us to stay consistent with delivering on a big and ambitious agenda is there. I also think that, at least so far, there’s been a remarkable amount of agreement — not on all the policy details and not on all of the elements of what we’re trying to do, and this is complicated and everyone’s got different views — but on the fact that we need to move. We need to move with speed. We need to move with focus to try to get at those issues. We’re not having a fundamental debate that says we should be spending our time focused on something categorically different than the agenda the president’s trying to put forward. There’s a shared sense of where we need to get to and the stakes of what we need to get done. But within that, we’ve got a broad coalition and a caucus that’s got a lot of different views. And certainly, they make those views known.

ezra klein

One of my senses of the way the negotiating space here has changed is that in 2009, 2010, but also every administration prior to President Obama’s that I covered and that I knew of, everything was designed — every policy, every message from the beginning — with the expectation that there was going to be a negotiation with the congressional party of the other side, too. And to go back to the stimulus, there were tax cuts for that reason. The Affordable Care Act is built on the framework of Romney-care. And it seems to me that for both the administration and for congressional Democrats, everybody would love Republican engagement and votes and would be willing to make changes to get them, but things are not getting pre-negotiated down in the expectation of it and that that has really changed policy design in a pretty fundamental way. Is that reasonable?

brian deese

I would say two things about that. One is the president has been clear, and I hope and expect it’s clear in both the rescue plan and the jobs plan, that he believes we need to go big. It is a moment to be bold. It is a moment to outline what it is that the country actually needs, which puts you in the category of doing things that are big, bolder, things that haven’t been done in quite some time. And that’s the president’s firmly-held belief that the right thing for the country is to outline that kind of vision and then try to galvanize the country around why that’s necessary. That definitely defines the way that he is approaching this, and I think that is different. The second thing, though, to get at a point you’re making is that, particularly with respect to this jobs plan, part of what I think the president is showing is that you can actually outline a bold vision that’s not about trying to pre-negotiate or trim your own sails from what you think it’s right to do, while also proposing things that are broadly within the bounds of what both parties have agreed are necessary. I think it’s a difference between trimming your own sails, saying, I think what the country needs is X but I’m only going to call for 0.3 X, and saying, it turns out that that X that the country needs is something that is actually broadly supported across the country. It’s not particularly a partisan political priority. It’s just that it hasn’t been done. We haven’t figured out a way to get it done. That certainly gets us into this conversation on infrastructure. But the president’s view is that there isn’t a disconnect between being bold and proposing things that putatively, on their face, there’s no reason why Democrats and Republicans couldn’t work together. Now, we’re going to work to figure out whether that’s possible, but there’s no reason, on its face, why that shouldn’t be true.

ezra klein

Well, it seems to me that to the extent there’s a disconnect that is being exploited, it’s a disconnect between congressional Republicans and their base, that the administration is trying to propose things that do have Republican support, but that’s support from Republicans across the country. It is not being defined in the way it used to be to find, as support among sort of elite Republican think tanks and legislators in Washington.

brian deese

The thing about this jobs package that’s interesting in that respect is that there is so much, maybe in part because we have failed to actually do meaningful infrastructure investment for a decade and meaningful public investment for decades before that. There is so much that, actually, people out there in the country, particularly in areas of the country that have not benefited from prior investments, which often overlap with red parts of the country, rural America, areas where there’s been chronic under-investment in things like water systems and electricity systems and the like. There is broad overlap with things that we desperately need to do as a country and that have a broad common sense appeal. And so we certainly are trying to tap into that but in a good faith effort to try to say, if there’s any possible way that we can bring people together and do something in a bipartisan way in Congress, we’re going to do that. But to your point earlier, we’re not going to preemptively say the president’s only going to be out there arguing that we need to do half of what we need to do, simply because we think that that’s sort of a necessary precondition to have that conversation in Congress.

ezra klein

You and I have known each other for a while now. You were the young guy in the Obama administration. Now you’re the grizzled old guy running the National Economic Council. How are the young economists in the administration different ideologically or temperamentally than in your generation?

brian deese

I have a hard time thinking of myself as the old guy.

ezra klein

Sorry, man.

brian deese

No, but I get it. I get it. Well, so I think that there has been a lot more work done to try to understand what the roots of economic inequality are over the course of the last decade and openness to thinking about power and power dynamics in the economy, worker power. There’s significantly more intellectual work that has gone into, what has the decline of the unionization movement in the United States meant? Why and how can we realistically build that back? Whether it’s in, again, worker power issues, competition and antitrust, other areas where the space of thought was more constrained. Now it’s more wide open. And so that’s one example. Another example is get back to when we were talking about things that would be traditionally written off as industrial policy, where now, we’re asking ourselves questions about how do you actually think about building industrial strength in key sectors of the economy where we clearly have vulnerabilities and do it in a way that doesn’t get us into a place where we’re doing really dumb things, we’re picking winners, we’re wasting money, that kind of thing. The space of thought there has really broadened and having people who are really disciplined about making sure we’re thinking smartly about this but open to a much broader range of potential outcomes. The last thing I will say, and this was true during the Obama administration and now, it is also incredibly beneficial to have a combination of fresh thinking and experience, having somebody like Secretary Yellen on the economic team, who has actually served in the Clinton White House, been the Fed chair, been through economic crises. That perspective, too, also helps in making sure that we’re thinking carefully about the markets and about issues as well. So it’s an energizing team, but I think we have a broader diversity of perspectives willing to challenge some things that have been at least working conventions of economic thinking prior to the middle of last decade.

ezra klein

I’m going to lay some of my reporting cards on the table here and then use it as a bridge, which is that one thing that I have been struck by reporting on the administration and on this sort of new generation of Democratic staffers is that the generation of Democrats whose formative experiences were the financial crisis and the climate crisis just see the world and seem to me to see the role of government in that world very different than those whose formative experiences were maybe stagflation and the Clinton economic policies and then subsequent boom. And that strikes me, when I asked you even earlier how your thinking has changed, the first thing you said was climate. The first economic point you mentioned was climate. So I do want to talk about the climate context of this bill. Explain to me the theory of how the American Jobs Plan approaches climate and approaches dealing with the climate problem.

brian deese

So we have two big issues, when it comes to climate and our infrastructure. The first is that the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, be it flooding in the Midwest, fires in the West, storms in the Atlantic basin, if you have a climate-agnostic view to building infrastructure, you’re going to miss important elements of how you build resilient, smart, sustainable infrastructure. So that has to affect all of the things that you would think about in traditional roads and bridges. Even the most basic elements of infrastructure has to affect that because we have to build forward to the reality of the ways in which the physical environment and the environment that we all operate in have changed. So piece one is across every element of what we’re thinking about, we have to ask ourselves the question, are we building back to a more resilient place to address the inevitable impacts that we’re going to live through, independent of how effective we are at mitigating future CO2 emissions in the country, or greenhouse gas emissions in the country. So that’s piece one of it. And then piece two is if you think across the big systems in our country, the transportation system being one but the power and energy system being another, in order to actually solve climate change, we’re going to have to transform those systems. And actually, investing in infrastructure the right way could be one of the most effective ways to do that in a way that creates lots of jobs, creates lots of new opportunity, and is economically sensible as well. So the second way that we think about it from the structure of the American Jobs Plan is across those systems — transportation, power, the built environment, the homes we live in, the businesses we operate in, and then industry. And so if you look across each of those, the objective is, where can we make the investments necessary to build toward the future infrastructure system that we’re going to want and need? So obviously, on the transportation side, the thing that captures the most imagination is building out electric charging stations across the country. On the power sector side, it’s building the actual infrastructure of how we move electrons around the country in a way that is very job intensive, brings jobs to lots of different parts of the country, but is absolutely necessary, if that’s the sort of future structure. The built environment and industry get less attention but are extraordinary opportunities. And this plan has a very significant investment in upgrading buildings, making them more energy efficient. The jobs doing that happen all around the country. They’re construction jobs, building trades. A lot of it is actually high-value investment, where providing an incentive could actually unlock a bunch of private capital to invest, particularly in the commercial building space. On the industry side, both investing in R&D and in the deployment of new technologies that will help US industry lead in creating low-carbon or zero-carbon industrial applications to the future, whether that’s low carbon materials, steel, cement, or in zero-carbon areas like CCS and hydrogen. Those are places where you need public investment to actually help unlock new breakthroughs. And we have a big stake in having that innovation happen in the United States and then having the manufacturing happen co-located with the innovation. That’s one of the things I think we’ve learned about doing innovation policy well. So across all of those areas, we’re trying to think about where you can invest in a way that will help lay the groundwork for the future economy, the zero-carbon economy that we’re going to want.

ezra klein

So let me pose a friendly-fire critique I’ve heard of the theory and the plan, which is this.

brian deese

I can’t wait.

ezra klein

I’m sure you’re very excited. So some of the things you’re talking about are things, in theory, the private sector should know how to do. We built out gas stations in this country without it being the federal government that did it. Weatherizing homes, weatherizing buildings, upgrading energy efficiency — that stuff, the private sector knows how to do. So the correct economics approach to this, from this critic, is that through a carbon tax, you should raise the price of carbon and then let the magic of the private market go to work. Why does the government have to take such a central role here?

brian deese

So there’s a couple of things there. One is that we need to move as quickly as possible to decarbonizing our economy, and we need to do it in a way that creates as many jobs and as much economic opportunity as we can for Americans in this country. That is our objective. So if that is your objective, then looking sector by sector at what are going to be the foundational elements that are going to help unlock that private capital is a sensible way to do it. So in the transportation sector, inevitably and eventually, the private sector might solve the chicken and egg problem of are there enough charging stations to solve range anxiety sufficient so that people feel comfortable buying electric vehicles. But by the time that we have done that, we will have lost time on the climate side, and we will have lost opportunity, in terms of the underlying investments in the core innovations and elements that are going to become the basis of that industry for the future. So we see this in semiconductors. We’re already seeing this in batteries, but we’re intent on trying to stem the tide, which is we actually have a policy goal of not just having American consumers able to buy electric vehicles, but to have those vehicles assembled in the United States and have as much of the innovation ecosystem as possible happen in the United States because we believe this is going to be a growing global market and it’s one of the great export opportunities to build in the United States and make us a leader. To do that requires strategic upfront investment. It requires laying the foundation in a way that will unlock that private capital. And economy-wide pricing would have very different impacts in different sectors. So you see the stylized models of economy-wide pricing that drives emissions down in the power sector much more quickly. In the transportation sector, it doesn’t because of the barriers. So if your goal was to try to drive down emissions in the transportation sector, you would need a very different pricing structure. That’s all, in part, an answer to the thoughtful critique. I think the other more practical answer is that it’s been true for multiple years that energy efficiency upgrades in commercial buildings are close to in the money. And so in the private sector, they should just happen and they’re not. And so the other thing that we’re trying to do is to look across and say, what are the practical barriers where, strategically, public investment or the public sector can play a catalytic role? A lot of these are market failures or barriers that are not just solvable by a price and unlocking the private sector. The reason why we don’t have transmission buildout sufficient to support the increased buildout for renewable energy is a complicated mix of politics and economics and jurisdictional issues that, actually, the federal government intervening with a combination of incentives and requirements could really help unlock. And so our view, certainly, is more nuanced than let’s just set a course and the private sector will sort it out. I think that that’s borne out both by the urgency of needing to act and also the practicality of, in a number of these places, the barrier is not just a pricing barrier. The barrier is trying to overcome something else.

ezra klein

And so I want to plug a political idea in there, which is that it seems to me the theory — and this is a change in theory over the past, let’s say, 15 years in climate politics — is you can’t just walk up to people and ask them for sacrifice. You can’t say, we’re going to do this by making energy more expensive and certain things are not going to be available anymore. You want to do this in a way that feels positive some to people. Better technologies, new jobs— you’re getting something out of it and being taken along in it, not that this is just a call for you get less in order for the future to get more.

brian deese

I want to double down on that and say it’s not just a messaging and narrative imperative, that actually, it has to be that Americans see and experience that, that the investments in building out a more resilient power grid actually improve their lives and create job opportunities for them or their neighbors or otherwise, and that an investment agenda along the lines of what the president has put forward actually is among the best opportunities we have to create a next generation of good-paying jobs all across America. That actually has to become true in practice. And in a sense, we’re better positioned now than we ever have because in so many of these areas, the market is moving toward cleaner and lower-carbon sources of energy. The global market is moving toward that. And so these investments actually can unlock more private investment, but doing that in a way where people feel as if the government policy is actually enabling that in a way that will make it better for their lives. So to your point, electric vehicles are coming. That’s an inevitability. The question is, can we do that in a way that’s going to be really good for our economy and for American workers and American consumers? And so part of what we’re trying to answer is the policy levers that will make sure that that’s the case and that we get there as quickly as we can, consistent with it being really good for American consumers and American jobs. So what the president has tried to do is he says, when I think about climate change, I think about jobs. That’s his narrative. But I think it is a good way of trying to encapsulate what it is we’re trying to accomplish. [MUSIC PLAYING]

ezra klein

So a lot of what’s going on in the climate space here is infrastructure. A lot of what’s going on in the rest of the bill is a very, very, very big infrastructure spend. There have also been a bunch of misses on big infrastructure projects in recent years. I’m in California, and I don’t get to ride the high-speed rail. So what has been learned on building infrastructure, practically at this scale? Or what needs to change in building infrastructure at this scale, such that we get the promised bang for the buck here?

brian deese

So I think we’ve learned a number of things, some of which coming from the Recovery Act, which I will say, I think overall, was a useful and successful investment in public infrastructure. But we also learned a lot of lessons. A couple of them — number one, this bill is not just focused on shovel ready. It’s also focused on shovel worthy. And in 2009, because the paradigm was fiscal stimulus, operate as quickly as possible, get shovels in ground as quickly as possible, that defined a lot of what was possible. There was a lot of focus on deferred maintenance. There was a lot of focus on obligating that money immediately, which meant that the state and municipal entities that were receiving the money, a lot of what they were doing was recycling that capital. If you look at the American Jobs Plan, there is a real focus on a multiyear public investment plan designed to get at those shovel-worthy projects, those projects that are not going to take forever but really do require some planning and technical capability. A second thing that I think is learned is that technical and technocratic capability matters, and it matters at the state and local level. And you have to invest in that capability. One of the things that is an idea that’s in the American Jobs Plan is this idea of an infrastructure America authority. It builds off of what other countries have done in the UK and Canada to try to actually build a independent authority that helps do broad, comprehensive reviews of where across the infrastructure complex are the highest-value investments to make but then also works with states and localities to build the technical capability so that the entity that is tasked with figuring out how to build the tunnel or lay the transmission line or build the bridge has the capability to think ahead to what are the things that could get in the way. The third is more on the political economy side, which is the more that we can use federal investments in a way that provides competitive funding to identify those areas where there is capability and appetite the better. So formula funding is important for some uses. If you look at the Recovery Act, almost all of it went through formula funding, in part because of that speed element. For example, in the jobs plan, there’s this focus on the 10 most economically significant bridges, which will all be very large, complicated projects because these are the bridges that the most people and stuff go over on a daily basis. But the goal there is to say, we want to run a thoughtful, national competition, perhaps using this infrastructure America authority, to say not only where do they exist, but where does the local buy-in and technical know-how exist? We can diligence it. You can encourage it by holding out the investment and then invest in those places where you have high confidence to do that. So I think in all of those areas, we’ve learned a lot. We’ve tried to build those lessons into the design of this plan. The last thing I would say is a lesson is there are more opportunities now. Because the market is driving decarbonized sources of transportation and electrification, there’s more opportunities at the seam between the transportation electric system where public capital can unlock greater private capital. So this idea of a clean energy accelerator, a clean energy bank is an idea in this plan that largely builds off of the thinking that members of Congress from both parties have done over the last couple of years. And we think there’s more opportunity to learn from what’s been done in other countries on that front that wouldn’t have been true several years ago.

I’m interested in this idea of using money to either reward or even to change local capacity and even laws on the ground sometimes by running the competitions. In the housing section of the bill, you want to build a ton of new housing, but it’s also connected, at least in some cases, to getting cities to change their zoning laws such that it is easier to build that housing. That’s a pretty interesting policy. I know it’s been kicking around for a bit. Tell me about how that might work in practice.

brian deese

Yeah, look, and just to be clear, there’s been some lack of clarity. This is not federal preemption of local zoning laws or anything. And in fact, these are ideas that build off of ideas that, again, Republicans and Democrats have at least put forward congressionally over the course of the last couple of years. But the idea is, basically, we need to build more housing in the US in the right places. And if we can do that, it has an important economic multiplier because it allows people to move to opportunity and move to jobs that are potentially ladders into higher-paying careers in areas where those jobs exist. And part of the opportunity in doing that is to have more enlightened zoning policies at the local level. But using investment can help sometimes get over the chicken-or-the-egg problem of changing zoning policies to allow for development is harder to do if you don’t have some investment or some match to help fund the construction of that housing. So the idea is relatively basic, which is to hold out that carrot but then put those resources in the areas where there’s going to be the biggest bang. And in some cases, that’s going to be because you’ve gotten a change in zoning that would unlock more opportunity to build housing in the right places.

I want to make sure we talk about the care side of this bill for a couple of minutes here. The American Jobs Plan reads, even before COVID-19, our country was in the midst of a caregiving crisis. Talk me through the pre-coronavirus crisis.

brian deese

This is a place where I think policy has to be personal. I think there are so many people out there who are either caring for an elderly parent, millions of people who actually care for adult children who have some form of disabilities that require significant care, and then, of course, parents of children, particularly younger children. And pre-pandemic, if you look at the infrastructure to support the care of those people, which is ultimately an economic prerequisite for those parents, for those caregivers to actually participate in the economy fully, that infrastructure has been failing for some time. So something you know well, the backlog for home and community-based care in Medicaid is hundreds of thousands of people. So if you need that care, you’re in no way guaranteed that you could access that care. The lack of affordable and quality childcare in the country prior to the pandemic was a significant constraint on the ability for families to find the right balance of having one or both partners in a parenting relationship actually work. And so pre-pandemic, we’re in a place where that infrastructure was holding back our economy, holding back our potential. And then, all of a sudden, we have this pandemic, which is this perfect exacerbator of that failed infrastructure of care, certainly with respect to the elderly population and the disproportionate death we’ve seen because the care infrastructure for nursing homes and for how we care for the elderly has failed us in this context of this pandemic. And then for parents, one of the biggest legacies that we will have to focus on coming out of this crisis is parents, and disproportionately women, leaving the labor force because they don’t have an alternative care option in the pandemic. So as we think about building back the infrastructure of a better economy on the back of this pandemic, we are focused on what the right public investments are to build a stronger care infrastructure going forward.

ezra klein

It has seemed to me that one of the things a pandemic did to change the politics of this is that basically every family that had older parents or young kids or just anybody in the family in a difficult situation suddenly got exposed to the kind of absent care infrastructure or disrupted care infrastructure that a lot of families, that was simply their normal before the pandemic. Part of it’s simply been an exposure to a preexisting reality, but now it hit everybody simultaneously, which changes the politics of it pretty profoundly. But so what does all this investment amount to once it is all spent out? What care options or what reliability that isn’t currently there in care options would be available to a family compared to right now?

brian deese

Well, I want to pick up on one thing you just said, which I think that you’re right that it exposed, sort of simultaneously, for the families who were reliant on that care. It also exposed the workforce. The people who care for the elderly and disabled in the country and the people who principally provide childcare are overwhelmingly women and overwhelmingly paid at poverty wages. And so the people who were in those nursing homes providing that elder care, part of the essential workforce exposed during this pandemic, are also the substructure of this infrastructure of care that is failing. And part of what is failing is the society failing to dignify the work that they do, which is some of the hardest work. This is some of the putting a face on modern infrastructure. People who put on a gown and go change bedpans and care for truly sick elderly people or provide care in those people’s homes are doing hard work that creates an infrastructure that allows so many of us to actually operate in the economy. So what’s different? One, access to that care, so for those families who otherwise couldn’t access it, building childcare facilities, investing in the supply side of childcare so there are more available options, and then also investing in mechanisms to ensure that the workers who provide that care are better paid, have more opportunity to organize. As we look at that as one of the expanding areas of employment in our economy, we’re going to need more care. And so we want to have that sector create not only more power for those workers, more dignity for those workers, but also career ladders so that there’s organization behind working in a home and community-based care workforce and that translates. There’s more formality. It’s less informal. There’s more opportunities to succeed and advance. So I think on the other side of this, in addition to addressing the immediate crisis situation of how do we get more parents and women back into the workforce and kids not losing years of their education, we should have a system where that care is easier to find, that quality care is easier to find, and that we’re compensating it, that we’re providing the right incentive that it’s compensated the way it deserves to be.

ezra klein

And that seems to be an idea laced throughout the bill. It’s here in the care section. It’s also in the PRO Act, which is about labor organizing. A lot of pieces of the bill deal with very profound market failures, the market’s failure to not just stop climate change, but actually, it accelerates it, market failures around inequality. But this is one where the idea seems to be that worker power has become a failure in the economy. And as workers in key industries have lost power or have been exploited, like in the care industry, that not only have been bad for those workers, but it’s actually been bad for everybody.

brian deese

The president’s view is, particularly as we make these public investments, we should make them tied to better wages, more collective bargaining and opportunity for workers to join a union, and to dignified jobs and dignified employment. And that takes different forms in different parts of the investment, but you are right that it is a core part of the whole agenda, including even things like investments in R&D. The public investments in R&D, particularly as we extend that to deployment, part of the theory here is that we need to invest in ways that we haven’t since the 1960s but also think about, how do we make sure that when we invest, we’re generating more quality job opportunities in the United States? And we hear a lot about this from different sides, but the president is unapologetic. The other element of using these dollars is that when we invest, we should be prioritizing American-made products and American prevailing waged labor. And there’s a climate element of that, too, which is that the power of federal procurement can be used to actually pull forward technology and pull forward new markets and do so in a way that builds more domestic opportunity. So saying that we’re not only going to buy building materials to build a bunch of new housing, but we’re going to make bulk purchases of lower-carbon building materials and we’re going to preference American-made products actually creates stable demand for US-based manufacturers. The same is true for electric vehicles. So saying that the US government is going to be a big purchaser of electric vehicles and make those commitments on the front end helps to buy down the cost of that, helps to buy down the cost of the battery technology that’s embedded in there. And I think that this plan and the president’s vision represents a much more forward-leaning willingness to use the tools of federal procurement to actually try to pull forward that technology connected to better-paying jobs.

ezra klein

We’ve talked a lot about what could go right here, if the bill passes. But assuming the bill passes and we know the American Rescue Plan has passed, what are you worried that can go wrong? We’ve heard Larry Summers talk about inflation, Republicans talk about budget deficits. What risks are you watching out for?

brian deese

If we’re talking about the Jobs Plan, the goal is, actually, to have a multi-year investment program. We haven’t got into the corporate tax reform and offsetting it. That’s a whole conversation of itself. I have less concern about overheat or about long-term fiscal issues because this is a plan that’s intended to invest largely one time, but multiyear and can straightforwardly be offset over a longer period of time. The principle areas where I have concern is about execution and implementation. It goes to some of the questions about lessons learned. We’re trying to accomplish a set of big things. And so when you’re trying to provide, for example, high-speed internet to all Americans, if you do that wrong, you can end up in a situation in which what you’re doing is you are subsidizing incumbents, you’re paying a lot for relatively little public benefit, and it costs a lot more than it should, right? When you are investing in large infrastructure projects, if you don’t prioritize some of the competitive aspects we talked about, the technocratic capability, you can end up with things taking too long or not happening. So to me, the biggest concern is demonstrating that multiyear public investment is actually in the interest of the American people and American workers will be a high-stakes effort to try to demonstrate that these types of government interventions can deliver. A lot of that will come down to execution. A lot of that comes down to the professionalism of the civil service at the federal level and the state and local level, a lot of which has been hollowed out. And so we have to be very humble about how hard that is and how much work and effort and focus and implementation that will take across time. But that’s where a lot of, I think, our focus needs to be on getting it right.

176,Racism Makes Me Question Everything. I Got the Covid Vaccine Anyway. - The New York Times,"The same way, a story about Dorothy Dandridge and a pool just fits: As the urban legend goes, the movie star was visiting a hotel in Las Vegas in the 1950s, and she dipped a single toe into the all-white swimming pool. This so disgusted the hotel’s management that they drained the entire thing. This story, which was also depicted in the HBO biopic about her life, has never actually been confirmed. But to anyone familiar with the history of America’s relationship with its Black citizens, the anecdote is believable. Maybe it ain’t true, but it also ain’t exactly a lie.

To question whether this bottomless skepticism is justified is like asking whether a cow has cause to be wary of butchers. From redlining and gerrymandering to the Tuskegee experiment and Cointelpro, the proven conspiracies against Black Americans are so devious, so deep and so absurd that they blast open pathways for true-sounding non-truths to enter, too.

The terrible spoken word poems I wrote in college (“We’ll never get justice, because justice for just-us just-aint-for-us”) habitually referenced the so-called Willie Lynch letter — an instruction manual for controlling Black slaves that I, along with many others, believed was written by a slave owner in 1712 and contained deep insights into modern race relations. The truth: Willie Lynch never existed and the document was forged. I believed that the government conspired to track my thoughts and movements — as if my flaccid stanzas and banded collar Wilsons Leather biker jackets were a threat to the state. I even once allowed myself to entertain an argument that the natural color of milk is not white, but brown. (Don’t ask.)

The term “hotep” has become a catchall among Black people to describe other Black people who still believe some of these easily debunked stories — but the reality is that most of us have some hotep in us. And not because we don’t know how America really works, but because we know too much. The lack of trust in our nation’s systems and structures is a force field; a bulwark shielding us from the lie of the American dream. And nowhere is this skepticism more justified than with the institution of medicine.

I don’t trust doctors, nurses, physician assistants, hospitals, emergency rooms, waiting rooms, surgeries, prescriptions, X-rays, MRIs, medical bills, insurance companies or even the food from hospital cafeterias. My awareness of the pronounced racial disparities in our health care system strips me of any confidence I would have otherwise had in it. As critics of a recent Saturday Night Live skit suggesting that Black people are illogically set against getting vaccinated pointed out, the vaccine hesitancy isn’t due to some uniquely Black pathology. It’s a direct response to centuries of anecdote, experience and data. (Also, the demographic among the least likely to get a vaccine? White evangelicals.)",0
177,Why You Can't Watch 'Circus of Life' in Pakistan - The New York Times,"The people of Lahore throw a loud birthday bash for their Prophet, and Sarmad captured his hometown in rapture.

Three censor boards cleared the film for release in theaters in different regions.

The scriptwriter, Nirmal Bano, told me in September, “I felt indescribable joy in writing a male character who did all the household chores without painting him into some kind of hero.” It’s this householder, a caring man and struggling property dealer and, according to Sarmad, a good-enough Muslim, who faces the wrath of his community after a short video of him dancing goes viral. This, even though videos of old bearded men dancing at weddings are practically a subgenre on Pakistani YouTube.

Enter Khadim Hussain Rizvi, a real-life cleric and self-appointed guardian of the Prophet’s honor.

If a character like Mr. Rizvi were shown in a feature film, he would probably be considered over the top. Mr. Rizvi, who died in November, would appear at rallies in a wheelchair wearing spotless, starched white robes and a black turban. He was fiery and funny, mixing in his sermons poetry and curses with quotes from the holy texts.

Mr. Rizvi also thought he spotted blasphemy everywhere, including in Sarmad’s film.

A blasphemy charge in Pakistan is a tricky thing to deal with: One person accusing another of blasphemy can’t say what the insult was because just repeating it would be blasphemy, too. It’s also a dangerous thing.

In 2010, Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province, spoke up for Asia Bibi, a Christian woman accused of insulting the Prophet. He visited her in prison, even had a picture taken with her, and called on the blasphemy laws to be amended. Mr. Taseer’s bodyguard, the constable Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri, shot him in January 2011. Twenty-seven times.

Mr. Qadri was sentenced to death under the law of the land, and a cult was born: An ordinary policeman had killed a powerful governor, not because of any personal enmity, but because he couldn’t stand an insult against the Prophet. Mr. Rizvi founded the religious party Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan (T.L.P.) partly around the cause of getting Mr. Qadri released.

Mr. Qadri was hanged in 2016, but T.L.P. kept hunting for blasphemers. Mr. Rizvi latched on to a brief argument between two bearded characters in the trailer for “Zindagi Tamasha,” during which one threatens to accuse the other of blasphemy. He claimed this was an insult to Islamic scholars, and hence an insult to Islam. He said the film would be released “over my dead body.”",0
178,Opinion | This Is What Judicial Activism Looks Like on the Supreme Court,"The case the court denied this week was nearly identical. Jason Small, a Jehovah’s Witness, was required by his religion to attend services on Wednesday nights and Sundays. He worked for a utility company in a position that required occasional mandatory overtime, and he used his vacation time to avoid conflicts. When the company denied his request to take a vacation day for Good Friday, he took the day off anyway, and was disciplined by losing two days’ pay. He sued on several grounds, including Title VII, and lost in Federal District Court in Memphis.

Affirming that decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit observed that Mr. Small had not directly challenged the company’s claim that his requested accommodation would have imposed an undue hardship. Two judges on the panel, Amul Thapar and Raymond Kethledge, who are among the circuit’s most conservative members, wrote a separate concurring opinion — in effect, concurring with themselves, with an explanation. “In the end, this case doesn’t involve a challenge to the ‘de minimis’ test,” they wrote. “But litigants should consider such challenges going forward.”

In Mr. Small’s appeal to the Supreme Court, his lawyers insisted that “even if he somehow failed to raise the issue as fully as the court below might have wished,” his case was still worthy of Supreme Court review and was a good vehicle for overturning the de minimis standard of the Hardison case. “If the undue hardship issue were somehow deemed forfeited, the court should proceed anyway, as there is no prejudice to any party or court,” the petition said.

Except that’s not how the Supreme Court works. There are rare exceptions, but generally the court refuses to take up questions that have not received a full airing in the lower court. In fact, Justices Alito, Thomas and Gorsuch conceded as much in February of last year, when they issued a statement “concurring in the denial” of a similar case because “this case does not present a good vehicle for revisiting Hardison.” Writing for all three, Justice Alito added, “But I reiterate that review of the Hardison issue should be undertaken when a petition in an appropriate case comes before us.”

One of those three, Justice Thomas, did not join this week’s dissent. Neither did the court’s other conservatives, Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Perhaps the obvious impatience of Justices Alito and Gorsuch, their eagerness to depart from the court’s usual practice in order to get their hands on a precedent they don’t like, was a step too far even for colleagues who most likely agree with them on the merits of the issue. (Without comment, the court this week also denied a second case on the same issue, an appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, Dalberiste v. GLE Associates. The Hardison issue wasn’t cleanly raised in that case, either.)

The two justices’ bring-me-a-case plea qualifies as judicial activism in my book, but it’s just one piece of the picture. The Hardison decision was a case of statutory interpretation, meaning that if Congress believed that the Supreme Court got Title VII wrong in 1977, it has had 44 years to amend the statute.

That is not a far-fetched scenario. Congress added the religious accommodation provision to Title VII in 1972 in response to an appeals court decision that upheld a company’s refusal to permit an employee to take Sundays off. Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which President George H.W. Bush signed into law, to overturn several conservative Supreme Court decisions that imposed obstacles to Title VII litigation.",0
179,Opinion | The Heart and Soul of the Biden Project,"If, as expected, Biden’s American Family Plan includes universal pre-K education and free community college, that would mean four more years of free schooling for millions of young Americans. As Rahm Emanuel said to me, when was the last time we achieved something as big as that?

It’s also a unifying agenda. For the past several decades the economy has funneled money to highly educated people who live in large metro areas. That has created a ruinous class rift that divides the country and fuels polarization. The Biden measures would funnel money to the roughly two-thirds of Americans without a bachelor’s degree — who work on road crews, in manufacturing plants, who care for the elderly and are disproportionately unemployed.

It’s kind of interesting to me that the Democrats, the party of the metro educated class, are promoting policies that would send hundreds of billions of dollars to, well, Trump voters.

Because the Biden plan owes more to Hamilton than to socialism, it’s not only progressives who love it, but moderates, too. Jim Kessler, an executive vice president at the moderate Democratic group Third Way, sent me an email this week with the subject line, “Why Mods Love Biden Jobs Plan.”

Is it a risk? Yes, a big one. If your historical memory goes back only to 2009, then you think there’s no risk to going big on spending and debt. But history is filled with the carcasses of nations and empires that declined in part because they took on too much debt: imperial Spain, France in the 18th century, China in the 19th.

The Biden plan would have us pouring money into some of our least efficient sectors. As Fareed Zakaria noted recently, American infrastructure projects often cost several times more than European projects. Adding just two miles of new track and three stations to the New York subway system ended up costing $4.5 billion.

You can pour a lot of money into American infrastructure and get relatively little back.

But we’ve had 20 years of anemic growth and a long period of slow productivity growth. The current trendlines cannot continue. These are necessary and plausible risks to take if America is not to drift gentle into that good night. Look at the cities, like Fresno, Calif., and Greenville, S.C., that have surged back to life in recent years. What did they do? They invested in infrastructure and community colleges. The Biden plan is what has already worked locally, just on a mammoth scale.",0
180,"Opinion | Biden, Yellen and the War on Leprechauns","By the way, this isn’t just an American problem. The International Monetary Fund estimates that about 40 percent of the world’s foreign direct investment — basically corporate cross-border investment, as opposed to “portfolio” purchases of stocks and bonds — is “phantom” investment, accounting fictions set up to avoid taxes. That’s why on paper Luxembourg, with just 600,000 people, hosts more foreign investment than the United States does.

So the real problem with U.S. corporate tax policy isn’t loss of jobs, it’s loss of revenue — and the Trump tax cut made that problem worse.

For the most part the Biden administration’s Made in America Tax Plan is an effort to reclaim the revenue lost both as a result of profit-shifting and as a result of the Trump tax cut, in order to help pay for large-scale public investment.

As the plan’s name suggests, the administration’s experts — at this point it’s hard to find a tax expert who hasn’t joined the Biden team — do believe that there are aspects of the U.S. tax code that have created an incentive to move jobs abroad. But they see the problem as the consequence of details of the tax code rather than the overall burden of taxation.

And while they believe that tax reform can improve incentives to invest in America, the main focus of the plan — even of things like the proposal for a 21 percent minimum tax rate on overseas profits, emphasized by Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary — isn’t on these incentives so much as on increasing revenue from the corporate profits tax, which falls mainly on the wealthy and on foreigners, and is at a historical low as a percentage of G.D.P.

What about warnings from corporate groups that raising taxes on corporations would have dire economic consequences? Well, they would say that, wouldn’t they? And if raising taxes would have such a negative effect, why did cutting taxes fail to produce any visible positive results?

The corporate tax plan, then, looks like a really good idea. In part that’s because President Biden, unlike his predecessor, has hired people who know what they’re talking about. And it also marks a welcome break with the ideology that says that the only way we can help American workers is indirect action: cutting taxes on corporations and the wealthy in the hope that they’ll somehow deliver a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.",0
181,"These Rocks Made a 1,000-Mile Trek. Did Dinosaurs Carry Them?","In the summer of 2017, Joshua Malone, then an undergraduate at Augustana College in Illinois, visited a field research camp in Wyoming and picked up some rocks. Rounded at the edges and the size of small fists, they were out of place amid the fine-grained mudrock that had surrounded them, and Mr. Malone asked his father, David Malone, a geologist at Illinois State University who led the dig at the site, if he knew where the rocks had come from.

Four years later, the two have developed a surprising answer.

In a study published earlier this year in the journal Terra Nova, the Malones with colleagues say the stones came from a rock formation in southern Wisconsin about 1,000 miles to the east of where they were found. What’s even more surprising is their hypothesis for how the rocks made that journey: The researchers say they were carried in the guts of long-neck dinosaurs.

These animals, known as sauropods, reached lengths of over 100 feet and weights of 40 tons, and regularly swallowed stones known as gastroliths, perhaps to help them digest plants, just as some birds and reptiles do today. The hypothesis would explain how the rocks acquired their smooth and rounded textures. But questions remain about whether they really made the whole journey in the bellies of these great beasts.

The gastroliths were found in Jurassic-aged mudstones in a rock formation called the Morrison. A rainbow of pinks and reds, the Morrison formation brims with dinosaur fossils, including those of sauropods, such as Barosaurus and Diplodocus, as well as meat-eaters like Allosaurus.",0
182,Reverse Migration: Moving to Cities While Others Flee,"“We never used to lock our doors in Chandler, and now we’ve invested in security equipment,” Mr. Martinez said. “We weren’t expecting that.”

Despite the current noise level, however, they are eager for Covid-19 restrictions to be lifted so they can get a feel for the city at full volume, including the breweries and art galleries just outside their door that still have limited hours and capacity.

“We’re so curious about what it’s going to be like,” Ms. Martinez said.

And for some homeowners, no longer being bound by the constraints of a commute or even a physical office means they can flirt with a new location or lifestyle — provided they sell their home and shift to a short-term or month-to-month lease.

“The one thing Covid has done for everybody is, it’s said, you don’t have to wait until a certain time to make a move or explore options,” said F. Ron Smith, a broker with Smith & Berg Partners in Los Angeles.

“I’ve got clients right now who are selling their homes and saying, ‘You know what? Instead of buying right now, I’m going to rent in a neighborhood I’ve always been curious about, to try it out,” he said, adding that he himself sold his home recently and is choosing to rent while the market remains so erratic.

“If you look at the long-term projection on interest rates, they’ll tick up a bit in the next 18-24 months but nothing radical. So you’re not jeopardizing your position by not buying now. And you’re giving yourself an opportunity to explore a new area,” he said.

Much of the motivation for the rush to the suburbs, said Thad Wong, co-founder of the Chicago brokerage @properties, wasn’t as much about fleeing the city as it was about fleeing multifamily units. Many of Chicago’s urban neighborhoods are packed with single-family homes, and “we’ve actually had some of the greatest sales ever in the city in the last six months,” he said.",0
183,"In ‘Empire of Pain,’ the American Dynasty Behind OxyContin","Keefe nimbly guides us through the thicket of family intrigues and betrayals — how Arthur purchased the patent medicine company Purdue Frederick for his brothers, Mortimer and Raymond, in 1952, before he grew apart from them; and how Arthur’s heirs sold their shares to the surviving brothers after he died in 1987. Arthur’s descendants have tried to distance themselves from their cousins, protesting that they weren’t involved in the creation of OxyContin, but Keefe suggests they can’t get away from Purdue’s origin story. Arthur had created a fortune and a template.

It was Raymond’s son Richard who would push Purdue into the field of pain management. Keefe portrays Richard as ambitious, arrogant and almost comically impatient. One of Purdue’s reliable if unglamorous best sellers was a laxative; a restless Richard leaned on his staff to “get it to work more quickly.”

But OxyContin was different. Its innovation resided in its time-release coating, intended to slow down delivery of its chief ingredient, oxycodone — an opioid twice as potent as morphine, even if physicians back then were mostly unfamiliar with the name and assumed it was weaker. Purdue decided it wouldn’t correct this misapprehension; instead, the company instructed its salespeople to target family physicians, whom the company called “opioid naïve.”

The Sacklers themselves were shrewd — insisting all along that they had no idea that an alarming number of Americans were getting addicted to their product, even if their own sales data reflected what was happening. They also continued to obscure their family name behind the banner of Purdue Pharma. After pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge for misleading regulators in 2007, the company perversely doubled down on opioids by developing a painkiller patch. But the Sacklers otherwise slashed spending on research and development, choosing instead to start siphoning off more and more money for themselves.

This strategy came in handy in 2019, when Massachusetts became the first state to sue Sackler family members by name, and their response was to declare Purdue Pharma bankrupt, which allowed them to obtain an injunction on any lawsuits; by then “the family had looted its own company,” Keefe writes, and “Purdue Pharma’s coffers were nearly empty.” Last month, the Sacklers offered to pay $4.275 billion from their personal fortune in an attempt to end thousands of lawsuits that have been filed against the company. Whether their bid is accepted remains to be seen.

Needless to say, Keefe, who wrote about the Sacklers for The New Yorker in 2017, didn’t get the family to cooperate with this book, but in a note he recalls receiving a thumb drive that was mailed to him anonymously and included thousands of pages of documents. He sifted through 40 boxes of files from congressional investigations into the pharmaceuticals industry in the late ’50s and early ’60s. He interviewed dozens of former Purdue employees. He got in touch with Richard’s college roommate, who remembered Richard’s determination to spend a summer “solving the scientific riddle of the orgasm.” Even when detailing the most sordid episodes, Keefe’s narrative voice is calm and admirably restrained, allowing his prodigious reporting to speak for itself. His portrait of the family is all the more damning for its stark lucidity.

Amid all the venality and hypocrisy, one of the terrible ironies that emerges from “Empire of Pain” is how the Sacklers would privately rage about the poor impulse control of “abusers” while remaining blind to their own. Keefe describes a moment during congressional hearings last year, when Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi questioned Richard’s son, David, who tried to distance himself from a $22 million mansion his family had acquired by saying it was merely an “investment property” — as if that was exculpatory. But Krishnamoorthi was having none of it: “I would submit, sir, that you and your family are addicted to money.”",0
184,What President Biden Proposed in His Fiscal 2022 Spending Plan,"But most health spending by the federal government is not discretionary, meaning the proposal released on Friday does not show what the Biden administration hopes to do in Medicaid, Medicare and the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. — Margot Sanger-Katz and Noah Weiland

Dealing with border security and immigration.

The spending request reflected an increasing sense of urgency within the Biden administration to deter migration to the southwestern border, including $1.2 billion toward investing in border security technology, like sensors to detect illegal crossings and tools to improve entry ports.

The request does not seek any new funding for the border wall construction begun under Mr. Trump.

Mr. Biden also proposed $4.3 billion to speed up the release of minors to sponsors in the United States, to assist minors in immigration court proceedings and to provide mental health services to children separated from their parents under the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy, which led to the separation of thousands of immigrant families.

The funds would also be spent on processing more refugees displaced overseas. Mr. Biden has pledged to raise the cap on refugee admissions from the historically low annual cap of 15,000, although he has yet to sign the emergency determination.

The administration is scrambling to find shelter space for children and teenagers crossing the border without their parents. Nearly 5,000 are backed up into border detention facilities because of the lack of capacity in the shelters managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

Mr. Biden, who campaigned on increasing oversight over Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is requesting an additional $84 million for those agencies over the 2021 enacted funds. The money would be used to improve investigations of work force complaints, “including those related to white supremacy or ideological and nonideological beliefs.” — Zolan Kanno-Youngs

Fans, lined up for New York’s first professional baseball game with live spectators since Covid shut down the city, called out, “There’s the next mayor of New York!” and “Good luck!” People milled around to have their photos taken with him. Yang bumped elbows and gave high fives; it was the most casual human contact I’d seen in a year.

When I asked Yang supporters why they want him to be mayor, I heard, over and over, variations on the words “change” and “energy.” “He’s young, he’s energetic, he’s a new face,” said Laivi Freundlich, a businessman and synagogue cantor from Brooklyn. “I’m tired of the old guard.” Some associated Yang, in an undefined way, with technological dynamism. “It’s a feeling,” said Thomas Dixon, a 61-year-old from the Bronx, about how Yang would “bring about necessary changes. Because like the country, New York City needs to move into the 21st century.”

With about 10 weeks until New York’s mayoral primaries, both public and private polling show Yang ahead in a crowded field, though up to half of voters remain undecided. In a survey released by Fontas Advisors and Core Decision Analytics in March, Yang was the top choice of 16 percent of respondents, followed by 10 percent for Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams. (Everyone else was in the single digits.) The Yang campaign’s private polling shows him with 25 percent of the vote and Adams with 15 percent.

The essence of Yang’s campaign is this: He wants to make New York fun again. He has a hip-hop theme track by MC Jin and a platform plank calling for to-go cocktails — a pandemic accommodation for struggling bars and restaurants — to become a regular fixture of city life. He’s constantly out and about, cheerleading each facet of New York’s post-Covid rebirth. He was there the first day movie theaters reopened, taking his wife, Evelyn, to see Eddie Huang’s coming-of-age basketball drama, “Boogie.” But for a kidney stone that landed him in the hospital, he and Evelyn would have gone to an off-Broadway concert on April 2, the day indoor shows restarted.",0

187,干旱危机中的台湾：保芯片厂供水，停农田灌溉,"台湾新竹——庄正灯那片不大不小的水稻田距台湾计算机芯片产业的神经中枢只有几步之遥。该产业供应了全球大部分iPhone和其他小电子产品的芯片需求。

今年，庄正灯为他的高科技邻居的经济重要性付出了代价。台湾遭受干旱困扰，想方设法将用水留给家庭和工厂，已经关闭了数万英亩农田的灌溉。

政府正在补偿种植者的收入损失。但是现年55岁的庄正灯担心，收成下降会促使客户寻找其他供应商，这可能意味着未来多年收入低迷。

他望着他干涸的褐色农田说：“政府是利用这种金钱把农民的嘴巴封掉。”

官员们称，这是半个多世纪以来台湾最严重的一次干旱。同时，它也暴露了承载该岛半导体产业所面临的巨大挑战。该产业是智能手机、汽车和其他组成现代生活的主要基石的全球供应链中越来越不可或缺的节点。

根据本着“一个中国”立场制定的一项沿用多年——且出了名的婉转迂回的——政策，美国是在不承认台湾独立的情况下支持台湾。美国为台湾提供政治和军事上的支持，但不明确承诺要捍卫台湾免受中国的攻击。

但是，随着中国力量和野心的日益增强，加之北京判断华盛顿将被削弱和分散注意力，有关美国是否应该对该岛的防御做出更清晰的承诺的辩论正在进行中，部分是为了降低因中国误判而导致不必要的战争的风险。",0
190,纽约亚裔成立民间巡逻队保护社区,"最近一个周六的下午，14名志愿者聚集在法拉盛缅街大邮局前的台阶上，向过往的人流分发紫色的医用口罩——与连接皇后区法拉盛与曼哈顿的7号线地铁列车颜色一样。特蕾莎·丁(Teresa Ting)是志愿者之一，她手机上的一个电子表格详细记录了他们当天在该社区的巡逻路线。一个小组负责缅街(Main Street)，另一个小组负责王子街(Prince Street)和37大道(37th Avenue)。

那起袭击事件激励丁女士成立了志愿者保安组织“缅街巡逻队”(Main Street Patrol)，对法拉盛中心区的情况进行巡视。除了使用安全干预对策和手机上的一个对讲机应用外，他们基本上不用其他装备。

以演员为职的丁女士是土生土长的皇后区人，她和来自城市其他地方的各行各业的志愿者们轮班巡逻，他们受到亚裔美国人无故遭袭而旁观者却无动于衷的愤怒所驱使。

“社区在过去的一年遭受了损失，”丁女士说。“需要有人来做点什么。”凑巧的是，那个周六是丁女士的30岁生日，这是她在新冠病毒病毒大流行期间度过的第二个生日，也是她担当起保护社区新角色后的第一个。

每个事件发生后，亚裔美国人都表示震惊和痛苦，但他们也指出了由来已久的偏见，这种偏见在大流行病期间被放大了。倡导人士还将目前的环境气氛归咎于前总统唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)和他使用的“中国病毒”等诅咒性但不准确的语言。

191,留住富人：香港推出减税等优惠政策,"不过，尽管香港最高领导人对这个拥有700多万人口的城市采取了更强硬的态度，他们正在争取一个至关重要的选民群体：富人。中国高层官员正准备出台新的税收减免和其他优惠措施，把香港描绘成亚洲最能赚钱的地方，尽管中共正在对这里施加越来越专制的统治。

到目前为止，这种宣传是奏效的。价值300亿美元的投资基金康桥汇世(Cambridge Associates)今年3月表示，计划在香港开设一家办事处。最近几个月，投资经理们已经成立了100多家新公司。高盛(Goldman Sachs)、花旗集团(Citigroup)、美国银行(Bank of America)和摩根士丹利(Morgan Stanley)等华尔街银行都在增加香港员工。

“香港是仅次于纽约的全球亿万富翁之城，”香港财政司司长陈茂波今年在一个金融业高管在线会议上表示。

吓走香港银行家和金融家的后果对中共来说非同小可。这个前英国殖民地仍然是进入国际金融体系的主要门户。中国公司需要通过它从全球投资者那里筹集资金；这些公司和中国富人也依靠它才能更容易地将资金转移到海外。

中国正在采取多种威迫利诱的策略，以实现规模宏大的新冠疫苗接种目标：让接种人数在6月底达到5.6亿人，即总人口的40%。

中国已证明了自己能有效地动员人们抗击新冠病毒疾病。有些国家已实现了广泛的疫苗接种，尽管它们的人口要少得多。



但中国面临着一系列的挑战。它已几乎完全控制了新冠病毒的传播，这让许多居民缺乏接种疫苗的紧迫感。中国过去的疫苗丑闻让一些人持谨慎态度，而它的新冠病毒疫苗缺乏透明度无助于缓解这种担心。再就是需要接种疫苗的人口数量。",0

中国正在经历一场消费品牌革命。中国的年轻一代更加民族主义，积极寻找与自信的中国人身份相符的品牌。创业者们争先恐后地打造能够引起共鸣的品牌和产品。在科技和媒体投资回报率不断下降之际，投资者正将目光转向这些初创企业。

当爱国主义成为卖点之时，西方品牌就会在竞争中处于劣势，尤其是在一个越来越要求跨国公司必须与中国公司遵守同样政治路线的国家。

这样的军事集结突显出菲律宾对争议海域的控制权进一步受到侵蚀，这可能会成为该国总统罗德里戈·杜特地(Rodrigo Duterte)的一个麻烦。

菲律宾国防部派出了两架飞机和一艘船前往牛轭礁记录集结情况，但没有进行其他干预。目前还不清楚越南军队是否做出了回应。

这些知情人士说，新规定已在全球银行高管和依赖这些银行贷款的在华外资公司中引起了震动。他们担心，新规可能会让外资企业在获得增长所需的资金上更多地依赖中国国有银行系统，以及其他方面的一些担忧。这种依赖可能会在中国就贸易、人权、地缘政治和其他棘手问题与华盛顿和其他国家对抗时，给北京提供另一个潜在施压点。",0

华纳兄弟向凭借《迷失》(Lost)和《盲点》(Blindspot)成名的电视编剧和制片人克里斯蒂娜·M·金(Christina M. Kim)提出，由她负责《功夫》重拍版，她同意了。接下来她创作了一部与原版天差地别的剧集，首先主角就大不相同。

“我非常、非常想有一个威风、彪悍的女性亚裔主角，”她在上月接受视频采访时说。

现代重拍版讲述的是妮基·沈（Nicky Shen，梁安平饰演）的故事，她是一位年轻的华裔美国女性，从大学辍学后前往中国的一间寺院，在那里接受了高强度的武术训练。回国后，她发现旧金山充斥着犯罪与腐败，她的父母金（Jin，马泰饰演）和梅莉（Mei-Li，陈琼华饰演）饱受一个源自中国的强大有组织犯罪集团的摆布，妮基用自己的武艺来保护她的家园——同时又和她已经疏远的家人恢复关系，寻找杀死她的少林师傅（瓦妮莎·凯[Vanessa Kai]饰演）的无情凶手。

创作始于2019年的《功夫》，在针对亚裔的种族主义甚嚣尘上、令人震惊之时与世人见面，这就让剧集对亚裔美国人所受伤害以及反抗的侧重有了一层额外的意义，尽管这是无心插柳，也并非创作者所愿。“我们的剧无疑不是解决问题的办法，但我希望我们能成为办法的一部分，”金在一次媒体活动中说，就在之前一天，亚特兰大有八人被枪杀，其中六人是亚裔女性。“在电视上能有我们这样的一部剧，让我们成了叙事的一部分。”

2019年底开始写试播集的剧本时，金想要强调存在于多代同堂的华裔美国人家庭中的独特互动。她知道她需要两个关键要素：一个迷人的运动型女演员以胜任主角的情感表达和动作需要，以及一个受人尊敬的亚裔美国人男演员扮演男性长辈，以提高可信度和严肃性。

她试镜了150多个年轻女演员，最终找到梁安平，她最知名的角色是《吸血鬼日记》(Vampire Diaries)衍生剧集《吸血鬼后裔》(Legacies)中的艾莉莎·张(Alyssa Chang)。而对于父亲这一角色，克里斯蒂娜·金从一开始就想到一个名字：马泰。

200,可卡因、酒精和乌克兰：亨特·拜登回忆录直面争议,"在亨特·拜登的描述中，娜奥米“在放在副驾驶座位上的婴儿摇篮里睡得正香”——这个细节以今天的标准来看让人摇头。“突然，我看到妈妈的头转向右边，”他写道。“我不记得她侧面的样子：她的眼神，她嘴上的表情。她的头只是在摆来摆去。”在一个十字路口，他们的车被一辆拉玉米棒子的载重拖车从侧面撞上。

亨特记得的下一件事情是，他在医院的病床上醒了过来，博躺在旁边的病床上：“他不出声地一遍又一遍对我说这三个字：‘我爱你。我爱你。我爱你。’这就是我们的起源故事。”

他与博的遗孀的恋情，源于“想抓住我两人都已失去了的爱”。

亨特·拜登这本书的书名受了博·拜登在接受癌症治疗期间的一句口头禅的启发。“他坚称，等他康复后，我们要用我们的一生来欣赏和培育世界上的无止境之美。”亨特写道。“‘美好事物’成了含括关系、地方和时刻的所有东西的总称。” Gallery Books, via Associated Press

他与哈莉·拜登(Hallie Biden)“因共同经历的痛苦建立起一种独特关系”，随着亨特·拜登自己婚姻的破裂，这种关系发展成一种全面性的同居安排。他努力在侄女、侄子和嫂子身边起一个稳定作用，但他承认，一切都未能如愿。

“我们的关系是以双方拼命想抓住我两人都已失去了的爱开始的，而关系的破裂只是加深了这个悲剧，”他写道。“这让显然的事情变得清晰：失去的东西永远不再来。破镜难圆。”",0

202,离家出走自驾游，56岁的她成为中国女权主义偶像,"她的主要吸引力并不是她拍到的风景——虽然拍了很多——而是站在风景中的她袒露自己充满屈辱的婚姻、对家庭生活的不满和新发现的自由。高中文化程度的苏敏曾是一名工人，直率而柔弱的外表使得她意外成为了某种在中国鲜见的女权主义偶像。

年长的女性发来信息告诉她，她的故事是多么令人悲伤地熟悉，并在她的每个目的地用水果和家常菜向她表示问候。对于年轻女性，她给出婚姻和育儿的忠告。她的一个视频下的评论写道：“我希望我妈妈也像苏阿姨一样，为自己而活，不是被生活锁住、困住。”

她出人意料的走红说明了中国社会两大力量的碰撞：互联网的迅速普及，以及在一个传统性别角色仍然根深蒂固的国家（老一辈当中尤甚），性别平等的意识日益增强。

苏敏在米色帐篷里接受采访时说：“以前我不清楚这个状况。我好像感觉世界上就我的生活过得不太好。”她即将离开中国最南端的热带岛屿海南，并前往800公里以外、以郁郁葱葱的延绵丘陵著称的桂林市。

她说，直到在网上分享视频后，“我才知道有这么多人像我一样。”

在去年秋天之前，苏敏很少去旅行。但是她很早就迷上了自驾的念头。她说，她在西藏长大，有时错过了回家的校车，不得不步行约20公里的山路。每次一有卡车经过，她都会想像自己坐在方向盘前，既安全又舒适。但是汽车很稀有，拥有一辆似乎是不可能的。

苏敏每晚独自一人睡在宽约1.4米、长约2.4米、用梯子支撑平衡的车顶帐篷中。

18岁时，她搬到了河南，在一家化肥厂工作。五年后，她嫁给了丈夫。他们婚前只见过几次面——这在当时并不罕见——但是她以为结婚可能是摆脱她在家里承担的无尽家务的一种方式。

然而正相反，她说，她发现自己要负担更多的家务劳动，还有打骂。她的丈夫会消失很久，如果她问他去了哪里就会被打。有一次，他用扫帚殴打她。",0
203,食道癌患者迎来治疗新方案，可使无病生存时间翻倍,"这些病人都接受了化疗和放疗，然后进行癌症切除手术。正如通常发生的情况一样，病理报告显示，手术并没有移除所有的癌细胞，它们仍然潜伏在淋巴结和其他地方，为这些患者的癌症出现无法治愈的转移复发创造了条件。

纳武单抗已被批准用于其他癌症的一些患者，如霍奇金淋巴瘤、黑色素瘤和结肠直肠癌。有了这项新研究，专家们预计该药物将很容易获批用于治疗早期食道癌。

贝勒大学医学中心查尔斯·A·萨蒙斯癌症中心(Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor University Medical Center)负责人、新研究的主要作者罗南·凯利(Ronan Kelly)博士说，他和其他研究人员迫切地想帮助75%的患者，他们经历了异常困难的放疗、化疗和破坏消化系统的手术，但却得知癌症仍然存在或很可能复发。

如果没有其他形式的治疗，“我们知道很多人会很快复发，”凯利说。额外的化疗不仅令患者难以忍受，而且似乎也没有帮助。纳武单抗的副作用很少，似乎值得一试。

食道癌在美国很少见，占所有癌症的1%；每年大约有15000名患者死亡。但它是全球第七大最常见癌症，而且经常出现在东亚地区，尽管目前还不清楚原因，伊尔森说。

吸烟是一个危险因素，但研究人员认为，举例来说，中国的高吸烟率不能解释发病率高的原因。“我们不认为这是环境因素，”伊尔森说。",0

现在我们又来到了这样的时刻：在新希望的愿景召唤中放手一搏。拜登政府初期的这段日子就是一次大胆的飞跃。

我请拜登总统的高级顾问之一安妮塔·邓恩(Anita Dunn)思考三项宏伟的提议：疫情救助、基础设施建设和即将出台的“家庭”计划。是什么样的愿景将它们联系在一起？所谓的“拜登经济学”(Bidenomics)指的是什么？有趣的是，她提到了中国。

这个世纪可能属于中国人——伴随着他们的活力和我们的衰退。原始资本主义、威权主义和国家经济方向出乎意料的结合，可能使中国成为全球的主导模式。邓恩说，拜登总统相信，民主制度需要提醒世界它也能解决重大问题。民主需要站起来，表明未来仍然属于我们。",0

我的经理就像我渴望拥有的父亲。他相信我的潜力，关心我的感受。我想要的就是继续升职，这样一来，他手下的明星冉冉升起，我们就能继续合作了。这让每一项工作任务都有了使命感，无论多么劳累或乏味。

只要提到他的行为，就意味着质疑我们告诉自己的谷歌有多么特别的故事。这家公司预见到我们的每个需求——小憩舱、按摩椅、洗手间的棉签、弥补旧金山公共交通瘫痪的通勤系统——直到外部世界看起来充满敌意。谷歌就是伊甸园；而我生活在被驱逐出园的恐惧中。",0

208,苏伊士运河堵塞事件与全球化的未来,"但是从1980年代后期开始，更便宜的集装箱运输、消失的通信成本和改进的计算技术的结合颠覆了故事的走向。制造商和零售商采用了新的策略——例如，安排在A国购买化学品，在B国将其转变为塑料，在C国将其模制成塑料部件并将其运送到D国的组装厂。

集装箱船使零部件能够以较低成本从一个国家运输到另一个国家，而在互联网加速下的科技使管理人员能够从遥远的总部监督其供应链。

有两个因素推动了行业的重新分配。一个是工资：中国或墨西哥的工厂工人的工资与西欧、日本或北美的工厂工人的工资差距是如此之大，以至于即使低薪工人在一小时内能完成的工作量少得多，在上海制造也比在圣路易斯制造更有财务上的优势。另一个是规模经济。供应全世界的工厂可能会专门化，大批量生产较少种类的产品，并降低单位成本。

外国投资曾经与进出口密切相关。但是，有了外包，就没有必要让处于顶端的公司——通常是最终成品上的品牌名称——在需要零件或制成品的国家进行大量投资。企业可以廉价地建立供应链，与其他公司签约进行制造工作，而不是将股东的资本使用在工厂和设备上。

大约在1830年左右的工业资本主义兴起之时，全球化已现端倪，但从来没有像现在这样。将生产转移到国外所节省下来的费用令跨国公司高管欣喜。由于公司追求更低的成本，欧洲、日本、加拿大和美国的工厂关门大吉。从1980年代下半年开始，到之后的二十年，制成品贸易的增长速度是全球经济的两倍。

几乎没有人关注在制造和运输任何货物的过程中涉及公司数量所带来的风险。因供应链未能按时交付货物所导致的潜在收入损失完全被忽略了。",0

215,著名汉学家施舟人逝世，享年86岁,"一家人在战争中幸存下来，但父亲的健康受到影响，于1949年去世，享年42岁。（由于他们为受迫害的犹太人所做的努力，这对夫妇后来被以色列犹太大屠杀纪念馆[Yad Vashem]宣布为“国际义人”。）

战时经历对施舟人产生了深远的影响。

“这深深地塑造了他的世界观，包括对民族主义的仇恨，以及一种深沉的人文主义倾向，偏好地方性的民主而非宏大的民族叙事，”在巴黎高等研究应用学院(École Pratique des Hautes Études)教授宗教学的高万桑说。“这就是他对道教的理解。”

施舟人达到这一领悟的过程是漫长的。他移居巴黎，师从汉学家康德谟(Max Kaltenmark)，他是一系列重视道教研究的法国学者之一。但是，大多数学者侧重于较为传统的文献学，以求破译常常晦涩难懂的道家著作。

1962年，施舟人前往台湾的中央研究院学习。根据他常给学生讲的一段经历，在那里，他被告知道教不是一种宗教。

然而，在城镇和村庄中，他见到了道观，里面的道士在法事上使用道教典籍中的经文。他们没有受过多少正统教育，而是从他们的师父——通常是他们的父亲——那里学习的古文；他们属于道教中一支父系传承的派别。一些道士的族谱可以追溯到1000年前，这证明了古代宗教与现在的宗教的关联。

施舟人意识到，他必须亲身参与其中，于是开始在台湾南部城市台南市师从道家大师陈荣盛。他受箓成为了正一派的一名道士。

1980年代，施舟人在巴黎。在台湾学习后，他加入了法国国籍，并开始研究道教经典。 Family of Kristofer Schipper

八年后，他带着他的老师给他的一系列法事手册回到巴黎。他热爱巴黎，获得了法国国籍，并在巴黎高等研究应用学院就职，在那里他开始系统地研究道教经典。

施舟人最大的影响力也许是通过他的学生。他大约有15名学生成为宗教研究教授，还有更多的人慕名前去巴黎。他将他们带入自己的世界，邀请他们居住在自己的家中，允许他们充分使用他的图书馆，其中一个学生第一次工作面试时，他还把自己的西装借给他，并在他们的孩子出生或在他们结婚时做道教法事。",0

这名官员的意图很明确——阻止罗孜做任何可能损害中国在日本声誉的事情。警告产生了相反的效果。罗孜邀请日本公共广播电视机构NHK秘密录下了第二次视频通话，后来向数百万的观众播放。

那段视频提供了一个罕见的机会，让人们看到北京拉拢和恐吓海外中国少数民族的举措，而且也有助于让日本更好地了解中国对新疆维吾尔人的镇压。",0

218,香港新选举制度将带来哪些影响？,"香港——中国对香港选举制度的全面改革将赋予国家安全机构巨大权力，决定谁能竞选政府职位，这可能在未来好多年里将亲民主反对派排挤到权力中心之外。

长期以来，香港的亲民主人士都在赢得直接选举的职位上享有更大的优势，但对他们不利的制度确保亲北京阵营控制立法会。周二，中国共产党控制的全国人民代表大会常务委员会在北京批准了香港的选举制度改革，这将保证建制派在立法会有更强大的多数席位。

这些变化赋予了北京及其精心挑选的香港地方领导人巨大的权力，来阻止中国认为不忠诚的反对派候选人，目的是消除引发2019年抗议活动的强烈反政府情绪。



以下是这些变化对香港的影响：

219,使用生长激素帮孩子长高？你应该更慎重,"我认识的一个八岁男孩个子比同龄人矮，比他的朋友们矮，甚至还不如他五岁的妹妹高。出于对生长激素使用增加的现状及其可能风险的担忧，我询问了他的母亲，是否考虑过给他使用这种治疗办法。她回复道，“没怎么想过。他身材就跟他父亲一样，小时候又矮又瘦，直到大学才开始蹿个子。”

她说他们的儿子没有激素缺乏症的迹象。“他的身高在第三百分位，而且多年来保持着同样的生长轨迹，所以没有必要干预，”她说。“他运动能力很强，身体健壮，其他方面也都赶得上他的朋友。”

他父亲现年41岁，身高1米83，但仍十分瘦削。他回忆称小时候自己还算强健，但没有朋友们那样的体力，速度和敏捷性弥补了他块头上的不足。“我喜欢竞技运动，学会其他人所没有的技巧，”他对我说，并表示他鼓励儿子认识并充分利用自己的技能。

如果所有身材矮小但身体健康的孩子家长都能如此谨慎就好了。专家估计，60%到80%身高低于其年龄段的儿童都不存在生长激素缺乏或其他限制生长的问题。但由于知道有疗法可以让孩子长高，一些家长会就他们眼中的问题求医问诊，哪怕孩子没有出现医学上的病态。但是，他们也应该知晓，新的研究已经将生长激素疗法与多年后的严重不良健康影响联系了起来。",0

222,拜登评估美中竞争：21世纪民主与专制的较量,"拜登的清单与习近平的“中国制造2025”有着惊人的相似之处。“中国制造2025”于六年前首次宣布，该倡议是为了让中国在关键技术上基本摆脱对西方的依赖。

拜登的基础设施和供应链计划的核心是确保西方国家不依赖中国的技术，这一努力部分始于特朗普时代。这场战役从针对下一代通信网络的制造商华为开始，但现在已经发展到担心像TikTok这样的中国应用程序可能成为攻击美国基础设施的途径。

拜登在预告他的观点时说：“中国的投资远远超越了我们，因为他们的计划是拥有那个未来。”

这是一种久经考验的方法：德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔(Dwight D. Eisenhower)总统利用第一颗人造卫星“斯普特尼克1号”(Sputnik 1)的发射，激发了一场军事和民用太空竞赛，而约翰·F·肯尼迪(John F. Kennedy)总统延续了这一方法，将目标设定为登月。

然而，尽管各方对中国的挑战意见一致，但拜登的政治策略是否会奏效远未可知。

共和党人既反对拜登计划中的巨额政府支出，也反对它将造成的庞大债务。这似乎注定要重演1980年代关于美国的一项联邦“产业政策”（将纳税人的钱直接投入到美国认为必须保持领先地位的技术中，从而创造竞争优势）究竟是可行的，还是只是扼杀了硅谷创新的争论。

225,一条走向成功，一条通往死亡：枪案折射亚裔迥异人生路,"杨氏亚洲按摩中心位于亚特兰大西北约28英里的阿克沃思切罗基村购物中心。购物中心的一些店主回忆说，店员坐着出租车来上班，在停车场休息，她们在那里打电话或听音乐。有时会看到有的人拿着杂货或干净的衣服进到店里。

一位认识其中一些员工并要求匿名的店主说：“他们只是在努力为家人工作，为了过上好生活。”

杨氏亚洲按摩中心是上周的枪击案开始的地方，谭晓洁和冯道友与另外两个人在那里被枪杀。21岁的罗伯特·亚伦·朗(Robert Aaron Long)被警方指控杀人，他称自己是一名性瘾者，并声称他正试图消除诱惑。

朗的室友说，枪手曾告诉他，他经常为了性需求去按摩院，尽管近年来亚特兰大及周边郊区的当局曾对按摩业的员工提起卖淫相关的诉讼，但没有独立的证据表明，他的暴行针对的水疗中心是他满足性需求的地方。

曾为无家可归者买鸡蛋和粗面粉的33岁华夫饼餐厅服务员德拉娜·阿什利·雅恩(Delaina Ashley Yaun)是和丈夫第一次去水疗中心，结果遇害。据附近一家商店的老板说，另一位受害者、现年54岁的保罗·安德烈·米歇尔(Paul Andre Michels)是水疗中心的杂工。他的兄弟说，他是一个电工，一个退伍军人，一个工作狂。唯一一名幸存者是30岁的路人埃尔西亚斯·R·埃尔南德斯-奥尔蒂斯(Elcias R. Hernandez-Ortiz)。他是一个父亲，也是一个技工，在汇钱给危地马拉的家人。

不到一个小时后，又有三人在黄金水疗馆被杀。然后，持枪者到了马路对面的香薰水疗中心，在逃跑前又夺去了一个人的生命。

和其他两家按摩院一样，香薰水疗中心在那之后也已经关闭。从正面看，它是一栋装饰有霓虹灯和艳俗标志的单调建筑。

层层控制

王德的公司与黄金水疗馆存在隶属关系，长期以来他一直是亚特兰大的公众人物，并活跃于当地的台湾人社区。

他是一名化学工程师，有一系列创业的经历，从合成皮革涂料到快餐连锁。在那之后，他开始了他的墨盒生意，公司曾经拥有100多名员工。

王德没有回应多项置评请求。当记者访问他拥有的一个乡村俱乐部住所时，一名说普通话的女性说他没有住在那里，然后打电话给私人保安，并向警方发出了警报。

根据富尔顿县的房产记录，黄金水疗馆所在的建筑物由弗吉尼亚州34岁的兽医艾希莉·詹妮弗·史密斯(Ashly Jennifer Smith)拥有，她于2012年以85万美元的价格购买了该建筑物。史密斯没有回应置评请求，她想更改租约，并将黄金有限公司告上法庭。两名员工——其中一名是金顺车——被卷入冲突，她的名字出现在一起强迫他们撤离该建筑物的诉讼中。不过，此案已经结案，金顺车继续在那里工作，直到上周去世。

亚特兰大警方记录显示，2011年至2013年期间，有11起因卖淫执行的逮捕。其中一些被捕者将水疗中心作为居住地址。亚特兰大警方说，当时进行突查的风化纠察队已于2015年解散，以释放更多资源用于应对暴力犯罪。佐治亚州公共卫生部表示，它不对按摩院进行检查或管理，这项工作应由佐治亚州务卿负责。但是州务办公室表示，它向个人按摩治疗师授予执照，而不是向企业授予执照。

警察说，枪手朗告诉调查人员，他以前曾去过黄金水疗馆和香薰水疗中心。

香薰水疗中心隶属于加尔特与洛克公司(Galt & Roark)，似乎是以安·兰德(Ayn Rand)的小说中的人物名字命名的。这位作家的作品受到自由意志主义者和美国右派的拥戴。

尚不清楚该水疗中心的所有权。根据公开记录，香薰水疗中心的房东是85岁的威廉·迈耶斯(William Meyers)的房地产公司，他在亚特兰大东北40英里的布福德拥有一个价值150万美元的湖滨豪宅。

在简短的电话采访中，迈耶斯说他已经听说了枪击事件，但不愿回答他是否了解该水疗中心本身的任何信息。

莫斯写道，食品公司另一个冷漠自私的做法是在1970年代末大量收购一系列受欢迎的减肥食品公司，这样便可以通过我们的减肥来获利，而我们正是因为吃了它们的产品而增重。加工食品巨头亨氏(Heinz)在1978年以7200万美元的价格收购了慧俪轻体(WeightWatchers)。卖掉克朗代克(Klondike)冰淇凌和Ben＆Jerry冰淇淋的联合利华(Unilever)在2000年以23亿美元的价格收购了SlimFast。生产巧克力棒和“热袋”(Hot Pockets)的雀巢(Nestle)在2006年以6亿美元的价格收购了珍妮·克雷格(Jenny Craig)公司。2010年，拥有Cinnabon和Carvel冰淇淋的私募股权公司收购了阿特金斯营养公司(Atkins Nutritionals)，该公司销售低碳水的巧克力棒、奶昔和小吃。这些饮食品牌中的大多数后来都卖给了其他母公司。

“食品行业阻止了我们在法院提起成瘾主张的诉讼；他们开始以不良方式控制科学，并掌控了饮食业，”莫斯在接受采访时说。“我在加工食品行业的阴暗面中摸爬了10年之久，我对他们策略的狡诈程度深感震惊，他们不仅要利用我们的本能，而且要利用我们对上瘾进行控制的尝试。”",0

229,"Opinion | After Working at Google, I’ll Never Let Myself Love a Job Again","So I didn’t tell my manager about my tech lead’s behavior for more than a year. Playing along felt like the price of inclusion. I spoke up only when it looked like he would become an official manager — my manager — replacing the one I adored and wielding even more power over me. At least four other women said that he’d made them uncomfortable, in addition to two senior engineers who already made it clear that they wouldn’t work with him.

As soon as my complaint with H.R. was filed, Google went from being a great workplace to being any other company: It would protect itself first. I’d structured my life around my job — exactly what they wanted me to do — but that only made the fallout worse when I learned that the workplace that I cherished considered me just an employee, one of many and disposable.

The process stretched out for nearly three months. In the meantime I had to have one-on-one meetings with my harasser and sit next to him. Every time I asked for an update on the timeline and expressed my discomfort at having to continue to work in proximity to my harasser, the investigators said that I could seek counseling, work from home or go on leave. I later learned that Google had similar responses to other employees who reported racism or sexism. Claire Stapleton, one of the 2018 walkout organizers, was encouraged to take leave, and Timnit Gebru, a lead researcher on Google’s Ethical AI team, was encouraged to seek mental health care before being forced out.

I resisted. How would being alone by myself all day, apart from my colleagues, friends and support system, possibly help? And I feared that if I stepped away, the company wouldn’t continue the investigation.

Eventually, the investigators corroborated my claims and found my tech lead violated the Code of Conduct and the policy against harassment. My harasser still sat next to me. My manager told me H.R. wouldn’t even make him change his desk, let alone work from home or go on leave. He also told me that my harasser received a consequence that was severe and that I would feel better if I could know what it was, but it sure seemed like nothing happened.

The aftermath of speaking up had broken me down. It dredged up the betrayals of my past that I’d gone into tech trying to overcome. I’d made myself vulnerable to my manager and the investigators but felt I got nothing solid in return. I was constantly on edge from seeing my harasser in the hallways and at the cafes. When people came up behind my desk, I startled more and more easily, my scream echoing across the open-floor-plan office. I worried I’d get a poor performance review, ruining my upward trajectory and setting my career back even further.

I went weeks without sleeping through the night.

I decided to take three months of paid leave. I feared that going on leave would set me back for promotion in a place where almost everyone’s progress is public and seen as a measure of an engineer’s worth and expertise. Like most of my colleagues, I’d built my life around the company. It could so easily be taken away. People on leave weren’t supposed to enter the office — where I went to the gym and had my entire social life.",0
230,"Biden wants to end gun-maker liability protections. That could sink the industry, advocates say.","WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden would like some divine help on his gun control agenda, but his ask might be surprising.

And gun-makers warn the results could be dire for their industry.

During remarks announcing new executive actions to curb gun violence Thursday, Biden took a detour as he imagined being able to ask God to immediately change one gun law, and it wasn't eliminating assault weapons or ""bump stocks.""

He would have the almighty let people sue gun-makers.

“This is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued. If I get one thing on my list — (if) the Lord came down and said, 'Joe, you get one of these' — give me that one,"" Biden said at a ceremony at the Rose Garden.

""Most people don’t realize, the only industry in America, billion-dollar industry, that can’t be sued, exempt from being sued, are gun manufacturers,” Biden continued.

Biden, who has spent years writing and fighting gun laws in Washington, is referring to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a 2005 law that largely shields firearm manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits when people use their products illegally, such as by shooting someone.

“He wants to drive us out of business,” Mark Oliva, the director of public affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade group, said of Biden. “So it's a very scary proposition, and we take it very seriously.”

The law is not as well known as some other hotly debated proposals like universal background checks or banning assault weapons. But the National Rifle Association called the PLCAA “the most significant piece of pro-gun legislation in 20 years"" when the law passed and gun control advocates have been trying to repeal it since then.

While many gun control advocates would still put universal background checks at the top of their agenda, repealing the PLCAA would be up there, too — though it admittedly faces a tougher climb in Congress, which is probably why Biden wanted supernatural help.

“The protections are unique in that they are defending the industry from the intended use of their product,” said David Pucino, senior staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center, which promotes gun control. “The industry knows that if the victims got their fair day in court, the industry would lose.”

This law was introduced in response to a flood of litigation seeking to use the courts to reduce guns after a prior attempt at legislation stalled out in Washington and many state capitals.

“These outrageous lawsuits attempting to hold a law-abiding industry responsible for the acts of criminals are a threat to jobs and the economy (and) jeopardize the exercise of constitutionally protected freedoms,” the bill’s sponsor, then-Sen. Larry Craig, an Idaho Republican, said at the time.

Craig succeeded in stopping the suits. Most litigation against the firearms industry is now dismissed, though the law provided for some exceptions, such as for gun defects or if there are violations of other state or federal laws by the manufacturers.

“The fact is that access to the legal system is what forced the auto industry to build safer cars with airbags and what stopped the tobacco industry from marketing to children. And so the result of that litigation was American lives saved,” said Nicholas Suplina, managing director for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety. “It really forecloses access to the justice system for people seeking to hold the industry accountable for irresponsible practices.”

For instance, Suplina said gun-makers could add safety features to prevent children from unintentionally shooting themselves or to make guns harder to steal, but there is little pressure on them to do so.

Kristen Rand, the legislative director for the Violence Policy Center, which promotes gun control, said if the law were changed, suits could likely be brought against gun-makers for selling weapons designed and marketed primarily for killing people, with military-inspired features and advertising.

“The vast majority of guns sold today are high-capacity semi-automatic pistols, assault weapons or really powerful guns like 50-caliber sniper rifles. There's very little market for traditional hunting rifles,” Rand said. “You remove PLCAA, you open up this whole world of mechanisms to hold the manufacturers accountable.”

The firearms industry and gun rights advocates, however, says the protections from litigation are not unique — but the opposition they face from anti-gun groups is.

Biden was wrong, Oliva and fact checkers noted, in saying the firearms industry alone can't be sued. Other industries, such as pharmaceutical makers and airlines, have special immunity from some types of lawsuits, and the gun industry does not have complete impunity.

“The gun industry absolutely can be sued,” said Oliva, of the trade industry group. “You just can't sue a gun-maker because someone criminally misused a gun. That would be like suing Ford because a drunk driver killed someone.""

In an ongoing high-profile case in Connecticut, state courts have ruled that victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting can sue Remington over the way it marketed the military-style rifle used in the massacre, thanks to a state law that triggered one of the exemptions in PLCAA.

Gun control advocates insist the firearms industry’s protections are unique, pointing to, for instance, the massive multibillion settlements that pharmaceutical companies are now paying out for misuse of their opioid products. And they note the gun industry did just fine before 2005, when the law passed.

But neither side thinks a change is likely. Repealing the protections would be a nonstarter for most Republicans in Congress and their gun rights allies, and it’s not even clear all Democrats in Congress would be on board.

“It would be a very tough fight,” Suplina said. “For us, background checks come first.”",0
231,Biden targets 'ghost guns' and 'red flag' laws in new gun control measures,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is trying to limit ""ghost guns"" and make it easier for people to flag family members who shouldn't be allowed to purchase firearms with a series of executive actions taken Thursday in the wake of recent mass shootings.

Efforts to find bipartisan agreement for popular gun control measures have fizzled, even as lawmakers expressed openness to provisions like tightening background checks.

The actions by Biden are limited and will still likely face legal opposition from gun rights advocates, who view any efforts to limit access as a violation of the Second Amendment.

The changes come in the wake of shootings in Georgia and Colorado and focus not just on trying to limit mass shootings, but also at reducing other forms of gun violence, like suicides and domestic violence, Biden said.

Hours after his announcement, at least one person was killed and five were injured in a shooting at a Texas, industrial park, police said.

""Gun violence in this country is an epidemic and it is an international embarrassment,"" Biden said in remarks he made in the Rose Garden. He was joined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Merrick Garland. A number of Democratic congressional members, gun control advocates and local officials also attended.

Biden also announced he is nominating David Chipman, a gun control advocate, to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF.

The White House detailed the planned executive actions, arguing that Biden's instructions to the Department of Justice will curb access to guns.

Biden directed the DOJ to write rules that will reduce the proliferation of ""ghost guns,"" homemade firearms often made from parts bought online and that do not have traceable serial numbers. Biden said he wants kits and parts used to make guns to be treated as firearms where the parts have serial numbers and are subject to a background check.

Biden also sought to reduce access to stabilizing braces, which can effectively turn a pistol into a more lethal rifle while not being subject to the same regulations that a rifle of similar size would be. Biden said the alleged shooter in Boulder appears to have used one of these devices.

Finally, he asked the DOJ to publish model ""red flag"" laws for states to use as guides. Red flag laws allow family members or law enforcement agencies to petition state courts to temporarily block people from obtaining firearms if they present a danger to themselves or others. Biden said states with such red flag laws have seen a reduction in the number of suicides.

Biden directed the DOJ to issue a report on firearms trafficking, which hasn't been done since 2000. He will also announce support for programs aimed at ""reducing gun violence in urban communities through tools other than incarceration,"" according to a fact sheet shared by the White House.

Biden has faced pressure from Democrats and gun control activists to take immediate action to address gun violence in the wake of shootings in Georgia, Colorado and California. House Democrats have passed gun control legislation, but there isn’t enough support even among Democrats in the Senate to advance that bill.

""The idea is just bizarre to suggest some of the things we are recommending is contrary to the Constitution,"" Biden said.

Gun control activists have also criticized Biden for not making gun control legislation an early priority of his administration, as he promised to do during his campaign for president.

In a call with reporters Wednesday night, administration officials stressed that Thursday's actions were just the first step and that Biden would still pursue legislative solutions to gun violence.

""This is an initial set of actions to make progress on President Biden's gun violence reduction agenda,"" one official said. ""The administration will be pursuing legislative and executive actions at the same time. You will continue to hear the president call for Congress to pass legislation to reduce gun violence.""

Still, it is unclear just how much political capital Biden is willing to put into getting gun control legislation passed on Capitol Hill where Republicans remain staunchly opposed to Democrats' proposals, especially as he turns his focus to getting his American Jobs Plan passed and as he continues to deal with the pandemic.

""The job of any president is to protect the American people, whether Congress acts or not,"" Biden said. ""I'm going to use all the resources at my disposal to keep the American people safe from gun violence. But there's much more that Congress can do to help that effort.""

Biden asked Congress to pass legislation already through the House to tightening background checks and reauthorized the Violence Against Women act. He also called again for a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines and removed liability protections for gun makers.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she supports the actions taken today and urged the Senate to act on two bills passed by the House to strengthen background checks.

“The gun violence crisis demands immediate, effective and strong action – which is why, as House Speaker, I strongly support the gun violence prevention actions taken today by President Biden,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""These steps will save lives: stopping the spread of so-called ‘ghost guns,’ helping ensure that dangerous people cannot access firearms and leading an evidence-based, whole-of-government initiative to reduce community violence.""

At a news conference late last month, Biden indicated that he was focused on other legislative priorities, such as his infrastructure plan.

""It's a matter of timing,"" he said, when asked about gun control legislation. ""As you've all observed, successful presidents, better than me, have been successful in large part because they know how to time what they're doing, order it, decide priorities, what needs to be done.""",0
232,"Prince Philip's funeral plans released, will lie at rest in Windsor Castle","LONDON — The funeral of Britain's Prince Philip, who died Friday at 99, may be like no other major royal event in modern history.

The death of Queen Elizabeth II's husband is expected to mark the start of eight days of national mourning.

But coronavirus lockdown restrictions currently in force in the United Kingdom mean that officials are discouraging crowds from paying their respects.

Given his age, the detailed plans for what should happen after Philip's death — codenamed ""Operation Forth Bridge"" — have been in place for years.

Philip will not have a state funeral and he will not lie in state, according to the College of Arms, a body that plays a role in royal funerals. State funerals are usually only granted to ruling sovereigns, but the decision also came at Philip's request, it said.

His body will, instead, lie at rest in Windsor Castle ahead of the funeral in St George's Chapel.

The queen is considering ""modified"" funeral plans in light of the pandemic and government guidelines, a statement from Buckingham Palace said Friday.

It reiterated pleas for people ""not to gather in crowds"" and said that ""those wishing to express their condolences are asked to do so in the safest way possible.""

The virus is still spreading in the U.K., which has enjoyed recent vaccination successes but has suffered one of the world's worst death tolls per capita.

""The funeral arrangements have been revised in view of the prevailing circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the College of Arms said in a statement Friday.

""It is regretfully requested that members of the public do not attempt to attend or participate in any of the events that make up the funeral.""

It is unclear when the funeral will take place; the College of Arms said further details would be announced.

By law, funerals in the U.K. must have 30 attendees or fewer — a world away from the pageantry of the Queen Mother's funeral in 2002, which saw 200,000 mourners line the streets.

Along with his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, Philip was vaccinated against Covid-19 in January.

Earlier this year, he was hospitalized for around a month, during which time he was suffering from what officials described as ""an infection"" and he underwent a procedure for an existing heart condition.

He died a little over two months before his 100th birthday.

Following Philip's death Friday, a framed notice was placed on the railings outside Buckingham Palace and all official flags will be flown at half-staff until the funeral itself.

The royal website was replaced with a single black page containing Philip's photo and announcing details of his death.

The BBC and other broadcasters stopped their TV and radio shows to play the U.K.'s national anthem, ""God Save the Queen,"" after the official announcement of Philip's death.

The public broadcaster said that all planned programming had been suspended.

Most networks broke into their scheduled programming, which was replaced by breaking news coverage, obituaries, historical analysis and international reaction.

Westminster Abbey in London began tolling its bell 99 times, once every minute, at 6 p.m. local time (1 p.m. ET) Friday.

The abbey was where Philip married Elizabeth in November 1947.

Gun salutes were expected at 7 a.m. ET Saturday from locations across the U.K., including the Tower of London, as well as all deployed British Navy ships.

The British Cabinet met at 5 p.m. local time (noon ET) to pay its respects. And the House of Commons will return Monday, one day early from its Easter recess, for a special session marking his life.

Britain’s political parties also temporarily suspended campaigning for next month's local and national elections.

As the world reacted to the news, members of the public began laying flowers outside Buckingham Palace and the entrance to Windsor Castle, where Philip died Friday morning.

This prompted a plea from the government for them to stop because of Covid-19.

""Although this is an extraordinarily difficult time for many, we are asking the public not to gather at royal residences, and continue to follow public health advice particularly on avoiding meeting in large groups and on minimizing travel,"" a Cabinet Office spokesman said.

""We are supporting the Royal Household in asking that floral tributes should not be laid at Royal Residences at this time.""

The royal family is asking people to make donations to charities instead of laying flowers at royal residencies, Buckingham Palace said.

The family also opened an online book of condolence.

It said a selection of the messages would be passed to the royal family and may be held ""for posterity"" in the Royal Archives, a selection of unique documents held in the Round Tower of Windsor Castle relating to royal history dating back 250 years.",0
233,"Prince Philip, husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, dies at 99","LONDON — Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband and the longest-serving consort of any British monarch, has died at age 99.

A statement posted on the royal family's website Friday morning said: ""It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

""His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. Further announcements will made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.""

His death was met with a flood of tributes from across Britain and the world. In accordance with tradition, a framed notice containing the news was also placed on the railings outside Buckingham Palace.

Philip spent 65 years supporting the queen, retiring from his public role in 2017 and staying largely out of the view since. In his active years, he helped set a new course for the monarchy, championing Britain itself, as well as environmental causes, science and technology.

His passing comes as the royal family confronts new challenges, most recently the intense publicity that followed the departure of Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, from both the United Kingdom and official royal duties.

Philip’s relationship with Elizabeth began as a story of young love.

“We behave as though we had belonged to each other for years,” then-Princess Elizabeth wrote in a letter to her parents shortly after they married.

Over the years, the queen acknowledged Philip’s deep influence on her, calling him her “strength and stay” in a speech on their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.

“I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know,” she said at the time.

The intensely private prince will likely be remembered for his early efforts to help modernize the royal family’s image during a time of great change for Britain and the world, especially at the outset of Elizabeth’s reign in 1952. He also developed a reputation for the occasional brusque comment and crass, if not racist, jokes.

“The queen inherited from her father a model of monarchy that was very hands off, old-fashioned and slightly invisible,” said Sarah Gristwood, a historian and the author of “Elizabeth: The Queen and the Crown.”

“It wasn’t equipped to deal with a new media age, and Prince Philip played a huge role in moving it forward then.”

Philip helped bring the royals to life on television rather than through radio reports. He was the first member of the royal family to do a televised interview and he presented a show on a royal tour of the Commonwealth. He is also said to have had a hand in televising the queen’s coronation in 1953 and in organizing a groundbreaking 1969 television documentary about the family.

“He helped create the model of the British royal family that has enabled it to continue forward into the 21st century,” Gristwood said. “We may have lost sight of that now, but I hope we’ll remember him for it.”

Despite being born into a royal family, Philip’s early childhood was not typically royal.

Born June 10, 1921, on the Greek island of Corfu, he was the only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark, and Princess Alice of Battenberg. Greece's king, Philip's uncle, was forced to abdicate when Philip was a baby, and the family fled to Paris, with Philip famously carried to safety in a crib made from an orange box.

At age 7, he moved to England, where he lived at Kensington Palace, now home to Prince William. Philip lived there with his paternal grandmother, Victoria Mountbatten, and later attended Gordonstoun, a boarding school in Scotland.

At 18, Philip joined the Royal Navy and graduated from the Britannia Royal Naval College as a top cadet. He saw active duty from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean, and in 1945 at the end of World War II, he was in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered.

Philip’s military career was truly central to his character, unlike perhaps other royals, according to Ashley Jackson, a professor of imperial and military history at King's College London.

“It’s easy to look at the military career of a royal male and see it as a rite of passage, but with Philip one needs to look beyond that,” he said. “He joined when he wasn't anywhere near marrying the future queen. This was a career path for a Greek prince,” he added. “This wasn’t a brief dalliance in the military. It’s important to note that he’s clearly an exceptional officer.”

Then known as Philip Mountbatten, he first met his cousin Elizabeth in 1934 at a family wedding. The two are both great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.

The couple exchanged letters while Philip was overseas during the war, only occasionally seeing each other. They would go out driving in Philip’s ""tiny MG"" sports car, as well as dancing at London nightclubs.",0
234,"Crowds gather in London to mourn Prince Philip, dead at 99","LONDON — Flowers piled up, the Union Jack flew at half-staff and in the dappled sunshine outside London’s Buckingham Palace, people gathered to pay their respects to Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II’s husband, who died early Friday.

As news of his death spread, more arrived on foot and by bicycle, the mood somber as some read the royal notice on the palace railings announcing his death.

“I feel so sad for the queen, to lose someone when you’ve been together for so long,” said Emma Bedford, 42, who had come to lay flowers along with her daughter Evie, 5. “He stuck by her side through thick and thin. Relationships go through ups and downs, but he was really a rock for her.”

Others echoed this view.

“We always look at the queen and think she’s so strong, but this was a big part of her life,” said Hafsa Sharif, 29, adding that she had “taken a moment” to remember Philip.

Caroline Sharma, 57, also noted that the Duke of Edinburgh had played second fiddle to his wife at a time when it was unusual for a woman to be the more prominent member of a couple.

“It must have been difficult for a man in the 1950s,” she said.

After their marriage in 1947, Philip spent more than 70 years supporting the queen in public and private, and over the years she acknowledged how important their relationship was to her, calling him her “strength and stay” in a speech on their 50th wedding anniversary .

Philip also made clear where his loyalty lies in a 2011 interview with the British broadcaster ITV when he explained why he gave up his active naval career. “Being married to the queen, it seemed to me, my first duty was to serve her in the best way I could,” he said.

Their decadeslong commitment to one another was praised by Cindy Tallefson, an educator originally from Colorado who currently lives in London, as she paid her respects.

“Being an American, it’s a bit different, but you know what, I just got teary-eyed. It’s really sad,” Tallefson, 62, said.

Others said Philip had humanized the royal family with his sense of fun and jokes.

“He seemed to be a witty face of the monarchy,” said John Coverdale, 30, who had cycled from West London on his lunch break to witness the historic moment. “The monarchy as an institution is quite formal, but even within that he was able to share a joke with people,” he added.

There was no mention by those outside Buckingham Palace on Friday of his more controversial comments, some of which have been deemed racist or insensitive, and at times attracted unwanted attention to the royal family.

Instead, people chose to focus on his mischievous personality, while others pointed out that his death reminded people that members of the royal family are humans too.

Referring to the fact that Prince Harry would not have been able to say goodbye to his grandfather in person, Tallefson said that during the Covid-19 pandemic “families all over the world have had to say goodbye to loved ones from long distance, and now the royal family is just like everyone else.”

The cause of Philip’s death was not shared, but in February he was admitted to a London hospital, and last month Buckingham Palace announced he had undergone a successful medical procedure on a heart condition. He later returned to Windsor Castle, around 30 miles west of London.

Back at Buckingham Palace, several people noted Friday that his death came at a particularly difficult time not only for Britain but also for the world, as many people across the globe mourn loved ones who have died from the coronavirus.

“I think this is going to be a focal point for people who have lost people and suffered,” said Elizabeth Holmes, 54, a retired teacher. “They’ll look at this almost as catharsis for their own grief.”",0

DMX was candid about his experience with substance misuse over the years. He also faced various legal troubles, including repeated arrests and brief stints in jail.

In an interview last year on rapper Talib Kweli's ""People's Party"" show, DMX said his drug use started at age 14 when his mentor at the time gave him a blunt laced with crack.

DMX, who got emotional during the interview, said he had never smoked anything before that night: ""I wouldn't do that to my worst enemy.""

In their statement, DMX's family said his music ""inspired countless fans across the world and his iconic legacy will live on forever.""

""We appreciate all of the love and support during this incredibly difficult time,"" they said. ""Please respect our privacy as we grieve the loss of our brother, father, uncle and the man the world knew as DMX.""",0

237,House Ethics Committee opens probes into Reps. Gaetz and Reed over misconduct allegations,"The House Ethics Committee announced Friday it was opening investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct against Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz and Tom Reed.

The probes come amid a Department of Justice investigation into Gaetz's travel to the Bahamas with women, and specifically whether those women were paid to travel for sex, which could violate federal law, NBC News has previously reported.

Reed, meanwhile, announced last month he would not see re-election following accusations from a former lobbyist that he had fondled her at a Minneapolis bar in 2017, and he apologized to his family and the lobbyist for his actions.

The Justice Department investigation into Gaetz arose from a criminal case against an associate, a former Florida county tax collector, Joel Greenberg. Federal investigators are also looking into whether Gaetz, 38, and Greenberg used the internet to search for women they could pay for sex.

In a statement, Committee Chair Ted Deutch, D-Fla., said the panel was aware of the allegations against Gaetz, including those involving the sexual misconduct accusations as well as others. But the committee investigation ""does not itself indicate that any violation has occurred or reflect any judgement"" of the panel.

Gaetz has not been charged with any crime, and he has repeatedly denied wrongdoing.

“Once again, the office will reiterate, these allegations are blatantly false and have not been validated by a single human being willing to put their name behind them,"" Gaetz's office said in response to the House ethics investigation.

In a statement to CBS responding to reports about the Bahamas investigation, a spokesperson for Gaetz deniedthat he had ever paid for sex and called it ""a general fishing exercise about vacations and consensual relationships with adults.""

The New York Times has reported that Gaetz is being investigated for allegedly trafficking a 17-year-old.

A spokeswoman working for Gaetz outside his congressional office, Erin Elmore of the Logan Circle Group, said Friday that he has hired attorneys to push back against the swirl of allegations.

""He's going to fight back against the unfounded allegations against him,"" Elmore said.

Reed, 49 said the incident involving then-lobbyist Nicolette Davis occurred “at a time in my life in which I was struggling,”and that he had entered treatment that year and realized he was “powerless over alcohol.”

The lawmaker, who was first elected to Congress in 2010, had been among the members calling for the resignation of Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo over sexual harassment allegations.

The Washington Post reported the allegations from Davis, who was 25 and a lobbyist for insurer Aflac when she said Reed, seated next to her at a Minneapolis bar, unhooked her bra from outside her blouse and moved his hand to her thigh.

Reed apologized to his wife and children and to Davis, and said he planned “to dedicate my time and attention to making amends for my past actions.”

Greenberg, meanwhile, has been hit with 33 charges in federal court in Florida, including stalking, wire fraud and sex trafficking of a minor. In a brief hearing in his case in Orlando on Thursday, Greenberg’s lawyer, Fritz Scheller, and federal prosecutors told the judge they expect him to strike a plea deal.

The parties did not signal if Greenberg was expected to cooperate in the investigation into Gaetz.

“I’m sure Matt Gaetz isn’t feeling very comfortable today,"" Scheller said outside the courthouse after the hearing.",0

Second week of testimony ends after medical examiner in Floyd's death A second full week of witness testimony ended Friday with the medical examiner who determined George Floyd’s cause of death and other medical experts testifying. Dr. Andrew Baker, the medical examiner for Minnesota’s Hennepin County, said Friday that fentanyl and heart disease did not directly cause Floyd's death. ""Mr. Floyd’s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint, his heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint,"" Baker said. The trial will resume on Monday, around 9:30 a.m. local time. Share this -







George Floyd medical examiner: Interaction with police 'was just more than Mr. Floyd could take' The medical examiner who determined George Floyd’s cause of death testified Friday that fentanyl and heart disease did not directly cause his death. ""Mr. Floyd’s use of fentanyl did not cause the subdual or neck restraint, his heart disease did not cause the subdual or the neck restraint,"" Dr. Andrew Baker, the medical examiner for Minnesota’s Hennepin County, said Friday afternoon. Baker ruled George Floyd’s cause of death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."" The manner of death was ruled a homicide. Baker broke down his ruling of the cause of death Friday, saying ""cardiopulmonary arrest” referred to the heart and lungs stopping and clarifying the term “complicating” meant “in the setting of.” Baker listed under ""other significant conditions"" that Floyd suffered from hypertensive heart disease, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. But he said Friday that other factors that are believed to have played a role in the death but “didn’t directly cause the death,” get relegated to the “other significant conditions” section of a death certificate. Baker said given the conditions of Floyd's heart disease and condition on the day of his encounter with police: “In my opinion, the law enforcement subdual, restraint and the neck compression was just more than Mr. Floyd could take by virtue of those heart conditions.” Unlike previous medical professionals who have testified, Baker did not directly attribute Floyd's cause of death to lack of oxygen or asphyxia.

Medical examiner in Floyd’s death testifies The medical examiner who conducted the autopsy on George Floyd and ruled on his cause of death took the stand Friday. Dr. Andrew Baker, the medical examiner for Minnesota’s Hennepin County, was called by the prosecution Friday afternoon. Baker ruled George Floyd’s cause of death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."" The manner of death was ruled a homicide. Under ""other significant conditions"" it said Floyd suffered from hypertensive heart disease, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. The defense has argued Floyd’s death was caused by a drug overdose and his health conditions such as heart disease, not by Chauvin’s restraint. Share this -

Seats are reserved in the back for just one Floyd family member and just one Chauvin family member because of the coronavirus pandemic. A member of George Floyd's family has been in the courtroom each day. This week the seat for a member of Chauvin's family member was removed because it had not been used.

Autopsy photos shown to jurors, but not publicly Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, explains to jurors what she sees in autopsy photos of George Floyd that are being shown to the jury, but not publicly.

Mary Moriarty, the former chief public defender of Hennepin County, where Chauvin's trial is being held, provides context as to what jurors are likely being shown: Since the public may not see them, I can tell you the the medical examiner’s office does a great job of draping the deceased and using close-up photos of various injuries.

Forensic pathologist ruled out drug overdose as Floyd’s cause of death Dr. Lindsey Thomas, a forensic pathologist, testified Friday that she ruled out a drug overdose as George Floyd’s cause of death. Thomas said based on the extensive videos she had seen in the death of Floyd and what she knew about fentanyl deaths, this was “totally different than what is seen in Mr. Floyd.” She added in regards to the level of methamphetamine found in his system, which she described as a low level, “looking from what I know about Mr. Floyd’s death, because it’s so well documented, that does not fit with a methamphetamine death.” Thomas agreed with prosecutors that she ruled out drug overdose as the cause of Floyd’s death. The defense has argued Floyd’s death was caused by a drug overdose and health complications rather than Chauvin’s actions. Share this -







Forensic pathologist: 'This was not a sudden death' Forensic pathologist says George Floyd death was not sudden or caused by overdose April 9, 2021 01:45 Forensic pathologist Dr. Lindsey Thomas testified Friday that George Floyd's death was ""not a sudden death,"" a conclusion she reached based on watching a plethora of surveillance, bystander and body-camera videos of Floyd's final moments. Thomas said she agreed with earlier testimony that it was law enforcement officers' actions that led to his death — adding that there was not evidence from his autopsy or toxicology reports that he died of a heart attack or drugs. ""What I observed from all of these videos is this was not a sudden death,"" Thomas said, contrasting it to something like cardiac arrest induced by shoveling snow, in which ""someone comes in and collapses, clutches their chest and falls over."" ""There was nothing sudden about his death,"" she continued. ""It was not the type of death that has been reported in fentanyl overdoses, for example, where somebody becomes very sleepy, and then gradually, calmly, stops breathing."" Fentanyl, an opioid, was found in Floyd's system, and an attorney for Derek Chauvin has argued that the fentanyl and an underlying heart condition may have contributed to his death.

Forensic pathologist agrees officers' actions ‘resulted in Mr. Floyd’s death’ Forensic pathologist: Law enforcement actions caused George Floyd death April 9, 2021 03:46 A Minnesota forensic pathologist agreed Friday morning that law enforcement’s activities in restraining George Floyd led to the man’s death. When asked how she interpreted the medical examiner’s cause of death, Dr. Lindsey Thomas said it meant, the activities of officers resulted in Mr. Floyd’s death. “Specifically, those activities were the subdual, the restraint and the neck compression,” she said. Thomas added she agrees with that conclusion. The Hennepin County medical examiner has ruled Floyd’s cause of death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.

Blackwell added that Thomas will testify that physical signs are not always present when someone dies from asphyxia or lack of oxygen. The prosecutor also said Thomas will agree in part with Baker’s findings, but she will disagree with other conclusions including his findings about the role that drugs may have played in Floyd’s death. Baker ruled George Floyd’s cause of death was ""cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression.""

239,Beloved doctor slain in South Carolina shooting remembered for deep involvement in community,"Friends of the South Carolina doctor who, along with three family members, was killed by a former pro football player on Friday recalled the physician's love of writing and passion for medicine and animals.

Dr. Robert Lesslie, 70, wife Barbara Lesslie, 69, grandchildren Adah Lesslie, 9, and Noah Lesslie, 5, and heating and air conditioning technician James Lewis, 38, were all gunned down Wednesday at the doctor's home in Rock Hill, South Carolina.

Lesslie was the founder and medical director of Riverview House Calls & Riverview Hospice and Palliative Care, according to the company's website. He received his medical degree from the Medical University of South Carolina and practiced in Rock Hill for 40 years, the website said.

He and his wife had four adult children and eight grandchildren.

The suspected killer, Phillip Adams, later died by apparent suicide, the sheriff's office said Thursday. Adams was a former pro football player, a journeyman cornerback who played six seasons in the NFL.

No motive was immediately known.

A prolific author

Dr. Lesslie was a prolific author who penned more than a dozen books about the intersection of medicine and faith.

Nancy B. Kennedy — whose book ""Miracles & Moments of Grace: Inspiring Stories from Doctors"" was published side-by-side with the doctor's ""Miracles in the ER"" — said she was ""gutted"" by the slaying, which she called ""senseless"" and ""so evil.""

Kennedy said she was always struck by Lesslie's ability to learn valuable life lessons from patients, no matter if they were one-time visits or he saw them over the course of long-time treatments.

""He thought deeply about these encounters that were sometimes just minutes long, and he drew such meaningful lessons from them,"" Kennedy told NBC News.

Another work of Lesslie's, volume two of ""Angels in the ER,"" is set to be published in August.

As a younger author, Kennedy said she was always grateful for Lesslie's encouragement.

""The thing I remembered and appreciated is that here he was a better known, much better known author,"" she said. ""He was so encouraging to me as a little known author, he had no qualms about being paired with an unknown, so I just appreciated at the time his willingness for us to work together.""

A community doctor with a love of animals

Lesslie also enjoyed treating creatures with more than two legs, keeping a mini zoo of ""several miniature horses, goats, donkeys, chickens and a lot of bees"" on his property, according to Riverview Hospice and Palliative Care Riverview, where he was the medical director.

Charlotte Stephens, a psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner at Spartanburg Medical Center, said Lesslie was one her early mentors and recalled how much compassion the doctor would show for patients who lost a family pet.

""He gave me my first (family nurse practitioner) job and believed in me,"" Stephens wrote in tribute to Lesslie. ""Sadness and shock is pervasive.""

Lesslie frequently organized fellow doctors and nurses to visit poor communities which didn't have access the medical care, according to author Faith Hunter.

""Lesslie ... did not believe in mouthing off about things unless you did something about those beliefs. He was a doer,"" Hunter wrote in a tribute posted to Facebook on Friday.

""He knew people in his community were underserved by the medical community when he led the way to outfit medical vans to take doctors and nurses to those in need. He helped establish and worked at the free clinic in his town.""

Trent Faris, a spokesperson for the sheriff's office, said Thursday that Lesslie was his childhood doctor.

""A lot of people know Dr. Lesslie,"" Faris said. ""This is a very tragic, tragic situation.""

And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., offered his condolences to the loved ones and friends of the victims in Rock Hill and York County, where ""the Lesslies were known as pillars of the community. ""

""We will continue to send our prayers to all those who have been impacted by this tragic event,"" the senator added.",0
240,"Amazon warehouse workers vote not to unionize in Bessemer, Alabama","BESSEMER, Ala. — Amazon warehouse workers here voted overwhelmingly against forming a union Friday after a monthslong campaign in which labor had hoped to make inroads into the sprawling company.

As of Friday morning, 1,798 employees voted against unionizing, compared to 738 in favor.

If it had been approved, the union would have been the first in the United States for Amazon, the country's second-largest employer.

Even as the vote was being completed, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, or RWDSU, the union seeking to represent the 5,800 workers in Bessemer, said it would challenge the vote by filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. It will allege that Amazon broke the law with some of its anti-union activity in the run-up to the election.

“We demand a comprehensive investigation over Amazon's behavior in corrupting this election,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the RWDSU. “Working people deserve better than the way Amazon has conducted itself during this campaign. This campaign has proven that the best way for working people to protect themselves and their families is to join together in a union. However, Amazon’s behavior during the election cannot be ignored and our union will seek remedy to each and every improper action Amazon took. We won’t rest until workers' voices are heard fairly under the law.""

Amazon disputed these charges in a blog post after the vote concluded. ""It’s easy to predict the union will say that Amazon won this election because we intimidated employees, but that’s not true,"" the post read. ""Our employees heard far more anti-Amazon messages from the union, policymakers, and media outlets than they heard from us.""

After the seven-week window to vote by mail ended March 29, the NLRB spent two weeks checking the eligibility of ballots and counting them in a process observed by the union and Amazon. Out of 5,876 eligible voters, 3,041 ballots were cast, but 505 were set aside as contested, mostly by Amazon, according to the union. Ballots can be contested by Amazon or the union based on factors like illegible signatures or questions about whether employees' job titles entitle them to vote. Those ballots are counted only if the final margin is small enough.

Few surprises

Labor experts said the results are not a surprise, given the resources Amazon has invested in countering organizing.

""It's so hard for workers to win in a situation like this,"" said Rebecca Givan, an associate professor of management and labor relations at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ""The most likely outcome in these situations is that the employer successfully busts the union by instilling fear and uncertainty into the workers, and even those workers that were initially in favor of organizing into a union get afraid and change their mind.""

The Bessemer warehouse, which opened in March 2020, is Amazon's first fulfillment center in Alabama. Workers started organizing toward a union vote in August, hoping it would help improve their working conditions. Currently, it is difficult to go to the bathroom without being penalized, said Jennifer Bates, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, who said she was inspired to support the union effort after regularly having seen her colleagues walk out of work limping from the physical toll the job takes.

At the start of this year, Amazon launched what labor experts characterized as a classic, well-funded anti-union campaign at the warehouse.

Workers said they were required to attend multiple meetings during their shifts, in which Amazon representatives explained why a union was not, in their view, beneficial for workers. Posters all over the warehouse, some of them in bathroom stalls, encouraged workers to vote no. The company also distributed buttons and stickers for employees to wear, and it created a website and a hashtag, #DoItWithoutDues, highlighting how workers might have to pay $500 in annual dues to the union.

Amazon has a long history of thwarting unionization. In 1999, the Communication Workers of America started a campaign to unionize 400 customer service employees in Seattle. After months of anti-union campaigning, Amazon closed down the call center in 2000 in what the company said was a restructuring related to the dot-com bust.

In 2014, 21 equipment technicians at an Amazon warehouse in Delaware voted against organizing with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers following what the union spokesman described as ""intense pressure from managers and anti-union consultants.""

Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako told Time magazine at the time that the ""no"" vote against third-party representation showed that employees ""prefer a direct connection with Amazon.""

Organizing fallout

Workers in Bessemer who opposed the union seemed to question its purpose.

LaVonette Stokes, who works as a labor organizer for the Alabama teachers union when she's not working at Amazon, and her husband are have positions as mid-level process guides that earn $15 to $19 an hour. But she said that a union for unskilled labor in Bessemer makes no sense and that it would move too slowly. She and her husband spent $2,400 of their own money to print flyers that detailed Amazon's benefits.

""We're talking about a union that has made contracts where, yes, they got a raise, but it took them about five to seven years before they even got to that raise,"" she said.

Her husband, William, said: ""We're not against unions. We're against this particular union, and we're against a union at this particular facility. Everything that this union is offering, we can do ourselves.""

Workers in favor of the union said they had hoped it would help improve their working conditions, providing better job security and benefits when Amazon is reporting record profits in part because of a pandemic-induced boom in online retail.

""I like my job. I give it 110 percent every day I go in there, regardless how hard it is, how stressful it is,"" said Darryl Richardson, a worker at the Bessemer warehouse. ""But I feel like employees deserve better and more for what they do.""

Richardson said he and other pro-union workers expect to be fired or forced to quit their jobs.

""I have to move on, and I hate it,"" he said. ""It's sad that you do everything you can to try to make things better for the people and you feel like you are going to lose your job.""

Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokesperson, said in an email, ""We respect all our employees' right to join, form, or not to join a labor union or other lawful organization of their own selection, without fear of reprisal, intimidation, or harassment.""

Amazon spokesperson Leah Seay said that in Bessemer receive health care coverage and hourly pay of at least $15.30, which is well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Alabama has no minimum wage law.

Employees also get a retirement plan, Seay said.

Broader impact

Despite the ultimate vote against unionizing, the drive attracted global attention to conditions for Amazon's warehouse workers and the lengths the company goes to prevent them from organizing, said Givan, the Rutgers professor.

""Workers around the country who have been watching what's happening will be potentially inspired by what can happen if you do take action and get national attention,"" she said.

It also drew attention from other unions. Following the results, Randy Korgan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters National Director for Amazon praised workers' attempts to unionize.

“Despite going up against one of the world’s richest men in a country with weak labor laws, the workers in Bessemer brought national attention to issues that many non-union workers face in this industry,"" said Korgan. ""This fight is not over, and the Teamsters will always support workers who want to build power by standing together and demanding dignity, a safe workplace, and a fair return on their work.”

Analysts said efforts to unionize at other Amazon warehouses in the U.S. are likely to continue, particularly in higher-cost states like New York and California. RWDSU spokesperson Chelsea Connor said the union received over a thousand inquiries about organizing from Amazon workers at other facilities since the organizing effort began.

""Amazon is already about the best-paying job a non-skilled laborer can get in Alabama,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. ""But in higher-costs states, it's barely a living wage.

""It will cut into profits,"" he said. ""But it's a humane thing to do.""

241,Cuba says it's 'betting it safe' with its own Covid vaccine,"HAVANA — Cuba is ""betting it safe"" with the later development of their own Covid-19 vaccines and encouraged by what they're seeing in late stage and experimental studies, a top Cuban vaccine scientist said.

If the trials are successful, the relatively small, communist island of 11 million — that has been sanctioned by the United States for decades — would be one of just very few countries with vaccines to fight the coronavirus pandemic, drawing worldwide attention to its potential feat.

The other countries that have developed vaccines, including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and India, have significantly larger economies and population sizes.

Two of Cuba’s five vaccine candidates are in Phase 3 trials: Soberana 2, which translates to 'sovereignty,' and Abdala, named after a book by the Cuban independence hero José Martí.

Around 44,000 people are getting the Soberana 2 vaccine as part of the Phase 3 double-blind study. An additional 150,000 health care workers are being inoculated with Soberana 2 as part of an “interventional study.”

“We are seeing that the vaccine is very safe, the potential risk for applying it to more people is decreasing, and the potential benefits are increasing. There is evidence of certain efficacy and that is why we decided to expand the interventional studies,” Dr. Vicente Verez, director of the Finlay Institute of Vaccines, told NBC News. The institute is named after the Cuban epidemiologist Dr. Carlos Finlay who discovered yellow fever is transmitted through mosquitoes.

The institute was established in 1991 by the late Cuban leader Fidel Castro who invested heavily in the country’s health care system and pharmaceutical sector. Its cancer research center developed a vaccine being tested in the United States and other countries.

In Cuba, “we began a bit later than the rest of the vaccines [in the world] because we had to wait and know a little more about the virus and the mechanism though which it infects cells,” Verez said. “We are seeing a safety profile with the vaccine [Soberana 2] that is very good.”

With its economy ravaged by the pandemic, decades of sanctions and a decline in aid from its ally Venezuela, the island has been grappling with shortages in food and medicine. Its economy shrank 11 percent in 2020. But it has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 infections and deaths down with strict measures and lockdowns, compared to many developed countries around the world. In recent weeks, the country has averaged around 1,000 cases per day, but it had very low infection rates last year.

The final results of the Phase 3 trials are not expected for months. The government’s plan is to have nearly all the inhabitants of the capital, Havana, vaccinated by May through the interventional study, and the entire country’s population inoculated before the year ends.

Verez said that while the vaccination won’t be mandatory, he thinks “the immense majority of the population wants the vaccine.”

For Cuba, the vaccine is as much about public health as it is a show of force; that a small communist country sanctioned by the U.S. can compete on the world stage with its own vaccine candidates.

Cuba could have acquired vaccines from its allies, China and Russia, but developing its own gives it the opportunity to sell vaccines to underdeveloped countries that have seen few doses, giving it a source of badly-needed hard currency. As U.S. and British vaccines advanced in clinical trials last year, wealthy countries in North America and Europe preordered large quantities, leaving poor and developing countries with a large gap in access.

Verez said some countries have approached Cuban officials with the intent to purchase more than 100 million annual doses of some of its vaccines. He said Cuba’s vaccine production system is being reorganized to produce 100 million doses.

Iran, which banned U.S. and British vaccines, will host a Phase 3 trial of Soberana 2 as part of an agreement that includes producing millions of doses there. Venezuela will produce Abdala vaccines, its government announced Thursday. Mexico and Argentina have also expressed interest in Cuba’s vaccines.

“They are very safe,” Dr. Eduardo Martínez Díaz, president of the state-run BioCubaFarma, said in emailed responses to questions. “After applying thousands of doses, only slight and moderate side effects were seen in a small percentage of volunteers.”

Díaz added that both vaccines are creating a high amount of immunity. If exported, the prices would be affordable, he said.

Verez said the vaccines will be adapted to the new variants, and extra doses could be required to boost immunity.

242,NASA helicopter set for historic first flight on Mars,"On a flat, barren expanse of Martian real estate, a tiny helicopter is poised to make aviation history.

NASA's experimental Mars helicopter, known as Ingenuity, is scheduled to take its much-anticipated first test flight on the red planet on Sunday. If successful, the joyride will be the first powered, controlled flight conducted on another planet.

""The moment that our team has been waiting for is almost here,"" MiMi Aung, the Ingenuity helicopter's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said Friday in a news briefing. ""We started with the fundamental question — the really serious question of, is it really possible to fly a helicopter on Mars?""

The helicopter's first outing has drawn comparisons to Dec. 17, 1903, when Orville and Wilbur Wright completed the first powered and controlled flight on Earth. Though the brothers took turns making several flights that day, Orville was at the helm when the milestone was set, flying 120 feet in 12 seconds into frigid headwinds near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

Last month, NASA revealed that a postage stamp-size swatch of fabric from the Wright brothers' first airplane, the 1903 Wright Flyer, was attached to a cable beneath the Ingenuity's solar panel.

The small, 4-pound helicopter hitched a ride to the red planet with the Perseverance rover, which touched down in an area of Mars known as Jezero Crater on Feb. 18. Weeks after landing, the rover transported Ingenuity to its ""airfield,"" a flat 33-foot-by-33-foot patch of the Martian landscape.

On Sunday, the helicopter will attempt to fly for the first time in Mars' thin atmosphere. During the test flight, which could last up to 30 seconds, the helicopter will climb to 10 feet above the Martian surface and hover for up to 30 seconds before touching down again, according to NASA.

While that short jaunt may seem simple, gravity on Mars is one-third that of Earth's, and the red planet's atmosphere is only 1 percent as dense as Earth's atmosphere, which all combined make controlled flight more challenging.

Plus, the Martian environment is a harsh and unforgiving place.

""It's very cold at night,"" Aung said. ""The vehicle we sent there has to survive cold nights on its own. It has to charge itself, and the winds are new to us.""

Engineers and flight controllers will also have to deal with a communications lag, which means NASA won't know how the helicopter performed — or even if it survives — until early Monday morning.

If the first jaunt is deemed a success, NASA may attempt additional experimental flights, taking the helicopter out to farther distances and higher altitudes. Ingenuity is designed to operate on Mars for about 31 days, according to the agency.

NASA has said small helicopters could be groundbreaking for future expeditions to Mars and for other planetary science missions.

Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA headquarters, said in a statement that Ingenuity could ""further expand our horizons and broaden the scope of what is possible with Mars exploration.""

And after nearly two months of checking its instruments and conducting tests, NASA is preparing to kick off the Perseverance rover's two-year mission to roam the surface of Mars and search for signs of ancient microbial life.",0
243,Explosive eruption rocks volcano on Caribbean's St. Vincent,"The La Soufrière volcano on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent erupted early Friday, sending nearly a six-mile high plume of ash into the air hours after residents were ordered to evacuate the area, officials said.

Photos and videos captured clouds of smoke coming out of the volcano about 8:40 a.m. as a thin layer of gray ash appeared to cover the surrounding area.

Emergency management officials said the ash column was about 32,000 feet high and that the ash was headed east into the Atlantic Ocean.

However, heavy ashfall also was reported in communities around the volcano, said Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre.

“More explosions could occur,” she said, adding that it was impossible to predict whether any potential upcoming explosions would be bigger or smaller than the first one.

There were no immediate reports of casualties or injuries.

The volcano last erupted in 1979, and a previous eruption in 1902 killed some 1,600 people. La Soufrière, standing at 3,864 feet above sea level, also erupted in 1718, 1812 and 1814, according to the Seismic Research Centre.

At 8:41 am this morning 9-4-21 an explosive eruption began at La Soufrière volcano in St. Vincent. This is a culmination of the seismic activity that began on April 8. The eruption is ongoing and more information will be shared as things progress. #lasoufriere #uwi #volcano #svg pic.twitter.com/C2zWrjPcpP — UWISeismic Research (@uwiseismic) April 9, 2021

The latest one followed mandatory evacuation orders issued Thursday for people who live near the volcano. Officials planned to place them aboard cruise ships, send them to nearby islands or take them to shelters elsewhere in St. Vincent that are outside the danger zone.

Roughly 16,000 people live in the red zone and will need to be evacuated, Joseph said.

""Evacuation of people in the red and orange zones to safe areas continues in earnest,"" St. Vincent's National Emergency Management Organization said in a tweet. ""Heavy ash fall has halted the process somewhat since visibility is extremely poor. NEMO continues to respond to the many challenges of the process #lasoufrierevolcanoeruption2021""

The pandemic could also hamper evacuation efforts.

Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a press conference that people have to be vaccinated if they go aboard a cruise ship or are granted temporary refuge in another island. He said two Royal Caribbean cruise ships are expected to arrive by Friday and a third one in the coming days, as well as two Carnival cruise ships by Friday. Islands that have said they would accept evacuees include St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados and Antigua.

“Not everything is going to go perfect, but if we all cooperate ... we will come through this stronger than ever,” Gonsalves said.

He noted that he was talking to Caribbean governments to accept people’s ID cards if they don’t have a passport.

“This is an emergency situation, and everybody understands that,” he said.

Gonsalves added that he highly recommends those who opt to go to a shelter in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, an island chain of more than 100,000 people, be vaccinated.

Emergency management teams have been going out to communities in the red zone and providing transportation to safer locations, including prearranged shelters, according to Joseph.

“They know who doesn’t have transportation because all of this has been canvassed before,” she said, adding that those who board the cruise ship would not be taken elsewhere but would remain there for an unspecified period of time.

By late Thursday evening, shelters were filling up as a string of car lights making their way to safer ground twinkled through the darkened mountains.

John Renton, a school principal who was in charge of one shelter, said in a phone interview that they had plenty of masks and other personal protective equipment but needed more cots. While talking, he was interrupted by a phone call from a government official asking about the state of things. “We’re over capacity,” he responded, noting that the shelter could hold 75 people and was already filled up.

Government officials tweeted that the dome of the volcano located on the island’s northern region could be seen glowing by nightfall. The alert issued Wednesday follows days of seismic activity around La Soufriere.

Gonsalves urged people to remain calm and orderly.

“I don’t want you panicked,” he said. “That is the worst thing to do.”

Scientists alerted the government about a possible eruption after noting a type of seismic activity at 3 a.m. on Thursday that indicated “magma was on the move close to the surface,” Joseph said.

“Things are escalating pretty quickly,” she said of the volcanic activity, adding that it was impossible to provide an exact forecast of what might happen in the next hours or days.

A team from the seismic center arrived in St. Vincent in late December after the volcano had an effusive eruption. They have been analyzing the formation of a new volcanic dome, changes to its crater lake, seismic activity and gas emissions, among other things.

The eastern Caribbean is home to other active volcanoes. Seventeen of the region’s 19 live volcanoes are located on 11 islands, with the remaining two underwater near the island of Grenada, including one called Kick ’Em Jenny that has been active in recent years.

The region’s most active volcano in recent years has been Soufriere Hills in Montserrat, which has erupted continuously since 1995, destroying the capital of Plymouth and killing at least 19 people in 1997.",0
244,Beast of five teeth: Scientists unearth skunk that walked among dinosaurs,"A fossil of a skunk-like mammal that lived during the age of dinosaurs has been discovered in Chilean Patagonia, adding further proof to recent evidence that mammals roamed that part of South America a lot earlier than previously thought.

A part of the creature’s fossilized jawbone with five teeth attached were discovered close to the famous Torres del Paine national park.

Christened Orretherium tzen, meaning ‘Beast of Five Teeth’ in an amalgam of Greek and a local indigenous language, the animal is thought to have lived between 72 and 74 million years ago during the Upper Cretaceous period, at the end of the Mesozoic era, and been a herbivore.

Prior to its discovery, and the teeth of the Magallanodon baikashkenke, a rodent-like creature, in the same area last year, only mammals living between 38 and 46 million years ago had been found in the southernmost tip of the Americas, the team that discovered it said.

The finds are critical to completing the evolutionary puzzle of the Gondwanatheria, a group of long-extinct early mammals that co-existed with dinosaurs, said Sergio Soto, a University of Chile paleontologist.

“This and other discoveries that we are going to make known in the future are revealing that there is enormous potential in terms of paleontology in the southern tip of Chile,” said Soto.

“We are finding things that we did not expect to find and that are going to help us answer a lot of questions that we had for a long time about dinosaurs, mammals and other groups.”

The discovery was published in the journal Scientific Reports by experts from the University of Chile working with researchers from Argentina’s Natural History and La Plata museums and the Chilean Antarctic Institute.

The scientists think Orretherium tzen cohabited with Magallanodon baikashkenke, which was thought to have been an evolutionary step between a platypus or marsupial, and dinosaurs such as the long-necked titanosaur.",0
245,New Hampshire teen saves West Virginia boy injured in ATV accident caught on TikTok,"As it turns out, TikTok may have a purpose beyond enjoying funny videos and learning trendy dance moves. For one West Virginia boy, it was a fellow TikTok user nearly 800 miles away who is credited with saving his life.

Trent Jarrett, 12, was livestreaming his high-speed ATV ride on Sunday when the vehicle suddenly crashed and the camera started tumbling. Fortunately for Jarrett, on the other side of the screen was New Hampshire teen Caden Cotnoir, who stepped in to help Jarrett when he needed it the most, according to WBTS, the NBC affiliate in Boston.

Gasping for air and requesting help from 911, Jarrett was heard by livestream viewers saying that he couldn't breathe. He asked them to dial a 10-digit number that he repeated, hoping someone would be willing to help.

""That was probably the hardest part, to listen to him just praying someone was there to help him,"" Cotnoir, 13, said in an interview with the news station.

He immediately jumped into action and showed the video to his parents for assistance. His stepfather, who is the police chief in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, helped Cotnoir write down and make a call to the 10-digit phone number that Jarrett shared in distress following the crash. The phone call successfully led Cotnoir to make contact with Jarrett's parents, who found their son on the side of the road within 20 minutes. He was stuck under the four-wheeler ATV and struggling to breathe, but uninjured, according to WBTS.

A grateful Jarrett and his family called Cotnoir back that night to thank him, offering him money as a gift of gratitude. For the teen, helping someone in need was fulfillment enough.

""I mean, I am just happy that I could help,"" Cotnoir told the news station. ""That's all.""",0
246,Texas man charged with planning to blow up Amazon data center in Virginia,"The FBI arrested a Texas man Thursday on charges of hatching a plan to blow up an Amazon data center in Virginia.

Seth Aaron Pendley, 28, of Wichita Falls was taken into custody Thursday after receiving what he thought was a bomb from a like-minded person, but it was actually a dud provided by an FBI undercover employee.

Court documents say Pendley came to the FBI’s attention after agents received a tip that he was posting alarming statements on a forum popular with militia groups, mymilitia.com. He began communicating through an encrypted messaging app with another person, who told the FBI that Pendley planned to use plastic explosives to attack the tech company’s data centers “to kill about 70% of the internet.”

The FBI says he told the undercover operative that he wanted to attack the data centers because he thought they served the FBI, CIA and other federal agencies.

Pendley was arrested in Fort Worth after he received what he thought was an explosive device and put it into his car. A court document said he admitted to having orchestrated the plan. A search of his home turned up hand-drawn maps related to the plan, the FBI said. Pendley did not possess any actual explosive material, the document said.

Court documents say he was also present at the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot, but a law enforcement official said there’s no indication that he entered the building.",0
247,Parent involved in college admissions scandal sues Netflix over documentary,"A Massachusetts financier who pleaded not guilty in the college admissions scandal is suing Netflix for defamation following the release of the streaming giant's new documentary ""Operation Varsity Blues.""

John B. Wilson, his wife, Leslie Wilson, and their son filed the lawsuit Tuesday in Superior Court in Essex claiming that the documentary, which premiered March 17, is the ""ultimate destruction of their reputations.""

Wilson, along with dozens of other parents, was arrested in March 2019 by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a sweeping admissions scandal, dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues."" Wilson is accused of paying $120,000 to hold a spot on the men's water polo team at the University of Southern California so his son could attend, according to NBC Boston.

Wilson was also allegedly working on two other deals to get his daughters into Stanford and Harvard, the outlet reported. He pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud.

The lawsuit states that Wilson is innocent and was ""deceived"" by William ""Rick"" Singer, the mastermind behind the scheme. It says that prior to the documentary's release, Netflix was warned in writing that the Wilsons ""could not simply be grouped into a narrative"" with other parents who have pleaded guilty.

""No individual, including a defendant awaiting trial in a criminal case, is required to sit by and permit the unlawful and unfair destruction of their reputation by a global media outlet,"" the lawsuit states.

It accuses the streaming platform of ignoring the facts and painting ""the Wilsons with the broadest and dirtiest brush possible.""

The documentary tells the story of Singer, who used a ""side door"" scheme to help wealthy parents — including actors Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman — get their children into elite colleges and universities through bribes or having them pose as fake athletic recruits.

In some of the cases, the parents are accused of paying Singer to proctor and correct their children's college entrance exam tests.

The lawsuit states that Wilson was referred to Singer by a ""world-renowned financial advisory firm"" that presented Singer as a ""highly reputable college admissions counselor.""

He believed his payments to Singer were ""legitimate donations"" to assist his children's admissions to the schools, the suit says.

""Among other things, the Wilsons made clear to Defendants that Mr. Wilson’s son was a real and talented water polo player who was part of the United States Olympic development program, that his daughters had 99th percentile test scores based on tests that they themselves took, and other publicly available exculpatory information, all of which the Wilsons provided to Defendants,"" it says.

The family wants public apologies from Netflix and the producers of the documentary, as well as monetary damages.

Netflix did not immediately return a request for comment Friday.",0
248,I moved back home during the Covid pandemic. Here's what I gained by giving up my solo life.,"The seeds of me moving back in with my mother were planted long before the Covid-19 pandemic started — I just didn't know it yet.

First, in 2015, after years of them struggling with health and financial issues, I helped my parents buy their house in upstate New York, but I never planned on living there. In early 2019, even when I helped them renovate it so my father, who was losing mobility, could navigate it more freely — though I struggled to afford it — I still had no intention of making their home mine, too. When my father then died in June 2019, despite not wanting to leave my mother living up there all by herself, I couldn't imagine moving in.

And even when Ma was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2019, and I started splitting my weeks between my overpriced studio apartment in Brooklyn and the house upstate (on which I was paying most of the bills) in order to help manage her care, I never considered giving up my city life to move to the suburbs. Absolutely not!

What spells failure more than a single woman in her 40s moving in with her mother near the small town she grew up in?

Then the pandemic hit.

After a three-week quarantine — yes, we knew the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommended two — I went home to stay with Ma.

Suddenly, all the myths I had bought into about what success looks like and how we were supposed to live as adults began to crumble. My mother was going through her final round of chemo, the last she needed to save her life, and yet I couldn't be there because she was too immunocompromised for me to go back and forth and risk exposing her to Covid-19.

So I waited in my practically dorm-room-sized studio in downtown Brooklyn afraid to even go in the elevator, let alone outside, trying to decide what to do next.

Like a lot of people in my position, I realized that, if I couldn’t leave it, my shoebox of an apartment was not designed to be a full-time home.

And my mom needed me: She couldn’t go to the grocery store or the pharmacy. She couldn’t physically deal with people coming to the door to make deliveries. She needed help getting to her appointments. That, after all, was why I'd been splitting my time between my place and hers to begin with.

So after a three-week quarantine — yes, we knew the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention only recommended two, but tests were hard to come by then — I went home to stay with Ma.

Suddenly, all the myths I had bought into about what success looks like and how we were supposed to live as adults began to crumble.

The plan was to stay for a month at first — until things “got back to normal.” But, of course, nothing went back to normal after a month. And our relationship changed: The trauma of losing my father the year before coupled with first her cancer and then the possibility of her navigating a different deadly disease alone quieted my perceived need to live independent of her. I’d already lost one parent; I wasn’t ready to face the potential loss of another.

Before I knew it, one month led to five. Somehow, rather than paying for a house I'd never live in, I was paying for rent in a place I was terrified to go near. I moved my stuff out of my studio and ended my lease.

In months that I was living with Ma — upstate and outside of the city — something else had happened, too. My body changed: Long riddled with anxiety issues, I was calmer, more in touch with nature, eating better and feeling less under attack from the day-to-day challenges of living in New York City in a body that wasn't white, thin or young.

I spent more time cooking and even learned some of her recipes, something I'd previously rejected as too domestic for me. We were able to heal from the loss of my father and face the unending global devastation together. We fought and drew new boundaries; we learned more about one another and our motivations as adults, not child and mom. We talked openly about mental health and spirituality. It was not all roses; we are still mother and daughter, after all.

And we are both aware this is temporary — which, somehow, makes both of us sad.

But as we consider the possibility of going back to the separate lives we once knew, I am still deeply changed by this time living with her and in nature (and with our five cats). I can’t imagine having lived through this any other way.

Perhaps some people still see moving home as a regression — maybe our endless quest to move ahead and “make it” will survive this pandemic intact — but it gave me stability during an unprecedented trauma. I know I’ll be better off for it, for the rest of my life.

249,Covid masks save American lives. They still can (and should) post-pandemic.,"As an emergency physician, there are many things that I will not miss when the Covid-19 pandemic is finally brought under control. I will not miss having to wear full personal protective equipment (two masks, face shield, gown, two sets of gloves) for every hospital shift. I will not miss having to tell a patient's family that they are unable to visit their loved one in the emergency department. I will not miss wondering whether I am bringing the virus home to my family. Most of all, I will not miss treating the rooms full of people, gasping for breath from this virus, hoping the few effective treatments available will save their lives.

I do hope, though, that a few things stick with us after SARS-CoV-2 becomes less of a threat. Respect for masks is at the top of that list.

I do hope, though, that a few things stick with us after SARS-CoV-2 becomes less of a threat. Respect for masks is at the top of that list.

Now, let’s be honest. We’re all anxious to see each others’ faces again. Once the majority of us have been vaccinated against Covid-19, masks will become less necessary. Mandates for public masking will be lifted, and universal masking will become less common. That’s OK.

But the pandemic has unequivocally proven the public health value of masks. And they should stick around in certain situations.

Masks have never been controversial in health care. My mask-wearing clearly protects my patients; that’s why we wear masks in the operating room, or when doing sterile procedures. But masks also protect me, whether from a co-worker with the flu or a patient with tuberculosis. That’s why I was one of the earliest advocates for high-quality personal protective equipment for health care workers in March 2020.

Our understanding of the value of masks for the public, on the other hand, has been fraught with controversy, and has dramatically evolved since the beginning of this pandemic.

A mea culpa: I and other public health experts were very wrong about the value of public masking at the start of the pandemic. Our statements were based on well-founded fears of hoarding (we all remember how toilet paper and flour were unable to be found!), but our guesses about the value of public masking turned out to be profoundly incorrect. We quickly learned that many of our assumptions that drove the early recommendations about public masking were, frankly, wrong.

But by April 2020, we had realized how important public masking could be. Because SARS-CoV-2 is spread by asymptomatic as well as symptomatic people, simply “staying home if you’re sick” doesn’t stop the virus’ spread; we need to protect each other from asymptomatic spreaders, too. Because the virus spreads by aerosols, simply maintaining a 6-foot distance from other people is insufficient; only with good masks can you stop breathing in the viral particles expelled by someone across the room. And although N95s and the equivalent are the most reliable, we have learned that even cloth masks can do a terrific job at filtering out the virus when good-fitting, well-made and appropriately used.

In other words, when people mask up, whether with cloth or surgical-grade masks, we dramatically decrease the rates of transmission of SARS-CoV2.

And they will continue to have value in certain circumstances going forward.

For example, even once the pandemic is mostly contained, there will likely be sporadic outbreaks of Covid-19 for years to come, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates or when novel variants appear. In those cases, we should be willing to once again temporarily mask up, to keep our community safe until the outbreak can be tamped down.

There will also always be groups of people who are not fully protected from Covid-19, even after being vaccinated. We already have studies showing that people who are immunocompromised (like transplant patients) do not develop full immunity. Those folks should be encouraged and supported in masking in public. By maintaining masking in crowded places for the rest of us — on public transportation, in malls, or in other indoor locations — we destigmatize protecting the vulnerable.

Finally, I have been struck by the impact of universal masking on other respiratory diseases.

I can count on one finger (really!) the number of cases of influenza I saw in my emergency department this winter. Based on national data, the same is true across the country. Although SARS-CoV2 is far worse than the flu, the flu is not benign; in a normal year, it is estimated to kill 12,000-60,000 people (depending on how bad that year’s variant is). The total lack of flu this year is a tremendous gift.

And pediatricians across the world will tell you how few of the normal “winter viruses” they’ve seen this year. This is, at least partly, due to masking. This, too, is an extraordinary feat, and worth repeating.

Here’s the final thing: When we are all willing to wear masks, even just in certain situations, the mask both loses its stigma and gains power to protect all of us from both big threats like Covid-19, and smaller threats like the flu. It no longer signals that a person is sick, or that a person is strange, nor that they have a particular cultural or ethnic background. It is no longer scary or felt to be an imposition on our rights. Mask-wearing can simply signal that we care about others’ health, and about our own.

This will require a sea change in our public attitudes, but other countries have done it: after the original SARS outbreak, many Asian countries normalized mask-wearing. And this sea change in attitudes is already starting to happen in the United States. Masks don’t have to signify something scary or unfamiliar. Check out Taylor Swift’s flowery mask at the Grammys, or Jennifer Aniston’s “famous face mask.” As the parent of an-almost-teenager, I can tell you that her mask has become her favorite new accessory. It has become a form of self-expression or a marker of being part of the in-group. It is also a growing domestic business opportunity.

One small takeaway from SARS-CoV-2 for Americans should be that masks can make a difference for us, too.

250,Covid walks kept this angry caffeine addict sane. And I'm going to keep walking.,"I never thought I'd miss working in an office. But then the pandemic sent me, like so many other office workers, into work-from-home purgatory in March 2020.

As I was locked down — literally — in my bedroom-turned-office-turned-break room, suddenly the impetus to move, whether my legs, my eyes or my perspective, evaporated. In a one-bedroom apartment that then became occupied 24/7 by two humans and endless conference calls, the bathroom was suddenly only four steps away; the coffee machine was five. Job and life distinctions evaporated.

My workday expanded. My world narrowed. I stopped moving. And then I started walking.

In the before times, the idea of going for a walk during the workday was an aspirational nonstarter. Who had the time? But Covid-19 highlighted for me how the rhythms and necessities of office life had once paradoxically required me to move around — to the kitchen for water, down the hall to the bathroom, up two flights of stairs to a conference room, down and around the block for lunch.

Meanwhile, my workday expanded. My world narrowed. I stopped moving. And then I started walking.

With each first step, I can feel my shoulders ratchet down from their now semi-permanent home just below my jaw line. I breathe in the familiar, somewhat fresh, scent of outside. With my friends Grace (Potter) and Miranda (Lambert) and Brandi (Carlile), I wander, letting my eyes focus on new-to-me objects not illuminated by an LED screen, on discarded White Castle cartons (Do I want a hamburger for dinner?) and tacky basement apartment light fixtures (Did that guy just totally catch me creeping?).

The randomness is blessedly the point. I swear I can feel my neurons regenerating. I let my mind shake itself free from the restrictions of calendar updates and deadlines and KPIs and grammar. I allow myself to lose focus.

I wouldn't call myself a good walker, to be clear. I have one colleague who for several months last year routinely walked 10 or more miles at a stretch; that's not me, and it's probably never going to be me.

In the winter, I walked circles around my Brooklyn block. This occurred mostly in the darkening late afternoon, my race against the sun a comically futile exercise. I walked, eyes watering, in the freezing cold. I walked into the wind, stupidly; I walked through the snow. It hasn't always been fun, but I've never returned home regretful.

As we contemplate a pinprick of light at the end of the tunnel, I hope I keep taking these random, short walks. No goal or destination needed.

I'm 33 years old with a good, and hopefully secure, job that I enjoy. I'm also a caffeine addict with raging imposter syndrome and a seeming unwillingness to create sane work-life boundaries. I don't like yoga or meditation and have found my tolerance for alcohol on school nights has, depressingly, decreased precipitously as I've gotten older.

And so I walk. And as we contemplate what hope feels like, I plan to continue taking these random, short walks. No goal or destination needed.

Of course, the health benefits of walking are well studied and well publicized. Studies have shown a whole host of benefits, from cardiovascular health to increased creativity and weight loss. What I think is perhaps slightly less well known is how little you have to walk to reap some of those benefits. I don't have time — or, at least, I tell myself that I don't have time — to walk briskly for 45 minutes in the middle of the day. But just 12 or 15 minutes of walking can boost your mood. And the benefits are even better if you walk around thinking nice thoughts about strangers, according to these saintly Iowa State psychologists.

I may not be walking around silently wishing passersby well, but walking has given me something intangible, ephemeral and surprisingly precious. And, as shown in some of those aforementioned studies, walking is actually great for productivity and creativity. So sometimes I do, with mild guilt, use walks to work; stepping out of my bedroom-box has helped me solve problems and brainstorm solutions.

But that's not why I want to keep walking, even after life goes back to whatever semblance of normal awaits.

Last week, I got my first Covid-19 vaccination shot. (The impact of its scientific mini-miracle was blunted only slightly by my lifelong and increasingly embarrassing needle phobia.) A few days later, I found a 20-minute hole in my calendar just past the time when most people have finished lunch. I put on Grace Potter's ""Daylight"" — a personal pandemic favorite — and turned the volume up.

""Bathe me in your warm glow,"" she sang. ""Show me what I've always known, show me that I'm not alone.""

I watched a blond dog in tiny little booties pick its way across the sidewalk. I wondered whether I should break my diet and get ice cream later. I felt the breeze in my mini-mullet and remembered how badly I needed a haircut. I blessedly lost focus. I walked toward the sun.

251,Pfizer requests FDA clearance for vaccine in kids ages 12 to 15,"Pfizer on Friday requested to expand use of its Covid-19 vaccine to adolescents ages 12 to 15.

The request asks the Food and Drug Administration to amend the emergency use authorization, which the FDA originally granted late last year for people ages 16 and up.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Last week, Pfizer-BioNTech said its Phase 3 clinical trials showed its vaccine was safe and 100 percent effective in 12- to 15-year-olds, though the findings have not been peer-reviewed.

""The hope of starting to vaccinate this age group before the start of the next school year,"" CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement when those results were released.

""Vaccinating our teenagers is the next step in seeing our way through the pandemic,"" said Dr. Buddy Creech, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.

""By extending the age groups that can receive vaccine, we can continue our efforts to protect those that are most vulnerable: older adults as well as adults and teenagers with underlying medical conditions,"" said Creech, who was not involved in the Pfizer research.

The FDA's review process will probably take several weeks, provided the data look good and are consistent with what was seen in adults, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, director of the Center on Medical Product Access, Safety and Stewardship at Georgetown University and former FDA chief scientist.

Norman Baylor, president and chief executive of Biologics Consulting and former director of the FDA's Office of Vaccine Research and Review, agreed.

The FDA does not need to consult with its independent advisory panel before amending the Pfizer EUA, though they may decide to do so in the interest of full transparency, Baylor said.

One-third of Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to an NBC News database. In order to vaccinate the entire population, however, vaccines will have to be authorized for children.

Pfizer is also studying how well the vaccine works in children ages 6 months to 11 years old. The first doses in that trial were administered in March.

The Pfizer vaccine is the only one currently authorized for teens ages 16 and over; the other vaccines available in the U.S., from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, are for people ages 18 and up. In December, Moderna began testing its mRNA vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. It is also studying its vaccine in children ages six months to 11 years old.

Pfizer's request comes as Covid-19 infections among younger teens and kids are driving outbreaks in some states. In Michigan, for example, case rates for children ages 10 to 19 are at an all-time high, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

252,"YouTube pulls Florida governor's video, says his panel spread Covid-19 misinformation","Video of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and a panel of scientists apparently trading in Covid-19 misinformation has been pulled from YouTube.

The video of DeSantis’ roundtable discussion last month at the state Capitol in Tallahassee was removed on Wednesday because it violated the social media platform’s standards, YouTube spokesperson Elena Hernandez said.

It had been embedded in a Tampa-area TV station's news story and it's removal was flagged by the American Institute for Economic Research, a ""free market"" think tank based in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

“YouTube has clear policies around Covid-19 medical misinformation to support the health and safety of our users,” Hernandez said in a statement. “We removed AIER’s video because it included content that contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities regarding the efficacy of masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”

Hernandez said YouTube only allows videos “that otherwise violate our policies to remain on the platform if they contain sufficient educational, documentary, scientific or artistic context.”

“Our policies apply to everyone and focus on content regardless of the speaker or channel,” Hernandez said.

DeSantis's press secretary Cody McCloud called YouTube's move ""another blatant example of Big Tech attempting to silence those who disagree with their woke corporate agenda.""

""YouTube claimed they removed the video because 'it contradicts the consensus of local and global health authorities,' yet this roundtable was led by world-renowned doctors and epidemiologists from Oxford, Stanford, and Harvard, all of whom are eminently qualified to speak on the global health crisis,"" McCloud said. ""Good public health policy should include a variety of scientific and technical expertise, and YouTube’s decision to remove this video suppresses productive dialogue of these complex issues.""

Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford University, one of the scientists on the panel, said this ""was a policy forum, in which it is appropriate to consider both the benefits and costs of a policy (child masking) when making judgments and recommendations.""

""YouTube’s censorship of our discussion is contrary to American democratic norms of free expression,"" the professor said in an email. ""It is also a violation of basic standards of scientific conduct, which stand in opposition to unreasoned silencing of contrary views and require the free exchange of ideas.""

Earlier, AIER editorial director Jeffrey A. Tucker insisted in an article Wednesday on the think tank’s website that YouTube censored DeSantis and the scientists and called it “the latest attack on public health information.”

Many public health experts, however, have accused Bhattacharya and the other scientists on the panel with DeSantis — former Trump White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Scott Atlas; epidemiologist Sunetra Gupta; and Dr. Martin Kulldorff — of spreading public health misinformation. NBC News has also reached out to Tucker, Atlas, Gupta and Kulldorff for comment.

NBC News did not see the video before it was removed. Tucker first reported its removal.

But based on a transcript provided by YouTube, it appears the participants ran afoul of the platform’s standards when DeSantis asked whether children in school should be wearing masks and Kulldorff replied, “Uh, children should not wear face masks, no. They don’t need it for their own protection, and they don’t need it for protecting other people either.”

Less than a minute later, Bhattacharya chimed-in, saying that mask-wearing “is developmentally inappropriate and it just doesn’t help on the disease spread.”

“There’s no scientific rationale or logic to have children wear masks in school,” Atlas said six minutes later.

That language also appears in the transcript posted by Tucker with his article.

Those claims run counter to the recommendations of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which advises that “people age 2 and older should wear masks in public settings and when around people who don’t live in their household.”

The World Health Organization recommendations are a bit looser for younger children, but kids age 12 and over “should wear a mask under the same conditions as adults.”

All the scientists in the video but Atlas are signatories to The Great Barrington Declaration, which was sponsored by AIER and which opposed lockdowns and argued that society would build herd immunity against Covid-19 if all but people over age 70 “resume life as normal.”

Atlas, who is a radiologist, not an epidemiologist, was especially critical of mask wearing to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

Many of the world’s leading scientists denounced The Great Barrington Declaration as a “dangerous fallacy unsupported by scientific evidence.” And later, then-President Donald Trump’s CDC chief, Dr. Robert Redfield, was overhead by NBC saying of Atlas, “Everything he says is false.”

The Trump administration embraced that thinking, as did DeSantis, who was criticized by public health experts for being slow to shut the state down and for reopening the state too soon. Most of the Covid-19 deaths and cases were recorded in Florida after DeSantis visited Trump in the White House last April and prematurely, as it turned out, declared victory over the virus.

As of Friday, Florida had reported more than 2 million Covid-19 infections and nearly 35,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest NBC News numbers. It also has the tenth highest Covid-19 infection rate in the country, according to Becker’s Hospital Review.

DeSantis in the AIER transcript agreed with his panelists that lockdowns were ineffective at stopping the pandemic, saying ""there’s really not a lot of positive to balance it out when you compare the severe lockdown states to other states which weren’t locked down or other countries like Sweden, which had adopted a different approach.""

Sweden initially opposed lockdowns but began imposing restrictions about six months ago after the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths soared, especially in comparison with its Scandinavian neighbors.",0
253,Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine shortage to hit U.S. next week,"Shipments of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine are expected to be down by 80 percent nationwide next week as the company struggles with manufacturing problems, the Biden Administration reported Friday.

Just 700,000 doses have been allocated, compared to the 4.9 million doses that were distributed across the country this week,White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients confirmed.

Johnson & Johnson will be delivering fewer vaccine doses next week, but Zients did not say how many although he insisted the company expects to be able to deliver 8 million doses per week by the end of April.

Zients also said Johnson & Johnson is in the process of installing a new management team at the Baltimore facility run by its manufacturing partner Emergent BioSolutions, which is where the vaccine production snafus have happened.

""The company is doing everything it can,"" Zients said. ""They have their best people at that plant.""

Johnson & Johnson spokeswoman Lisa Cannellos confirmed the company was working with the federal Food and Drug Administration to secure an emergency use authorization to get the plant up and running.

""The Company expects to deliver nearly 100 million single-shot doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to the U.S. government by the end of May,"" Cannellos said in a statement.

The dramatic drop in Johnson & Johnson shots was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The J&J shot was expected to significantly boost the pace at which Americans become fully vaccinated because it requires only a single shot.

While the pharma giant is based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the vaccines are manufactured in Baltimore. Emergent BioSolutions has also been making the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines.

But up to 15 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine were ruined when Emergent BioSolutions workers mixed up the ingredients of the two vaccines. And a week ago the company reported that a batch of its key vaccine ingredient didn't meet quality control standards at a Baltimore facility.

Zients said from now on, only the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will be manufactured at that plant.

Last week, two Biden administration officials assured NBC News that this setback would not affect their timeline to have enough doses for the U.S. adult population by the end of May.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was shown to be 86 percent effective in preventing severe forms of Covid-19. It received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in late February.

The company rolled out about 4 million doses almost immediately, but shipments have fluctuated significantly since then.",0
254,Air Force reservist on Covid front lines goes from securing body bags to delivering vaccines,"This time last year, Col. Brian Biggs of the Air Force Reserve was helping to dispatch refrigerated trucks and body bags to pandemic-ravaged New York City and other places in the Northeast that needed them the most.

Now, Biggs’ mission is helping to ensure that needles loaded with the Covid-19 vaccine get into the arms of as many people as possible in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.

“The difference between now and then is night and day,” Biggs, 45, said in an interview Wednesday. “Then, every day I could count on a daily dose of depression. Now I get a daily dose of hope.”

Biggs, a Nebraska native who now calls Madison, Connecticut, home, is one of the more than 10,000 members of the United States military who were called on to wage war against an invisible enemy that killed more Americans in one year than the country lost during nearly four years of fighting during World War II.

Much of the help the military provided at the height of the pandemic was medical, and the men and women who answered the call often did so at great risk to themselves. More than 176,000 of them tested positive for Covid-19, 1,588 were hospitalized and 24 died, according to the latest Department of Defense figures.

Biggs gets his shot of daily optimism at the Medgar Evers College Preparatory School, where he helps coordinate the community vaccination effort.

“When I walked into the gym for the first time, I was just amazed at the organized chaos,” he said. “The people coming in were predominantly people of color, people from underserved communities. You have to remember, Brooklyn was hit especially hard by the pandemic.”

Biggs has been in the Air Force for 22 years, all but four of them as a reservist. He's usually assigned to assist the state of Vermont with emergency preparedness,

“Our bread and butter, as it were, is dealing with the aftermath of hurricanes and other natural disasters,” he said. “We arrive at homes that have been destroyed and deal with people who are destitute. It’s often very depressing.

""Here, people were smiling and happy and darn-near dancing after they got their shots. The people were excited to see the U.S. military in their neighborhood.”

Biggs, who received his second dose of the vaccination last month, said he expects to be at Medgar Evers through April.

“We have 3,250 appointments just today, and that includes 30 to 50 that are 16- and 17-year-olds, which I think is great,” he said.

In his spare time, he and his wife, Dawn, run a nonprofit called “Random Tuesday” that stages “virtual running events” with “Harry Potter” and “Dr. Who” themes to get people to exercise and to raise money for worthy causes.

Biggs previously served in Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan, but says he was not always on the front lines of this fight.

“I did most of my work from Fort Living Room,” he said modestly, adding that the ""emotionally taxing work"" of collecting the bodies of Covid-19 victims fell to members of the National Guard.

“No soldier was allowed inside the homes, but they would collect the bodies from the threshold and then it was on to the next stop, on to the next stop, on to the next stop,” Biggs said. “It was a hard mission.”

But the times that Biggs ventured out into the field to inspect staging sites and to help the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others identify potential locations for “mass cold-storage of remains” were, in his words, “a surreal experience.”

“In the first week of April, I was checking into a hotel in Massachusetts and as I walked inside the clerk said, ‘Good afternoon, Mr. Biggs,’” he said. “They knew my name because I was the only guest checking in that day.”

Biggs said he got his first coronavirus briefing in February 2020.

“The thing I took away from it was that there was a great concern but also that we didn’t know fully what to expect,” he said. “Some experts were already saying it was going to be bad, others were saying it might not be so bad. But it was always in the spectrum of bad.”

Five weeks later, the country started shutting down.

“I remember that it was Friday the 13th, and my daughter came home from the eighth grade with all her stuff,” Biggs said.

Ten days later, he received new marching orders that came with an ominous sounding name — mortuary affairs and fatality management.

“Essentially, my job was helping coordinate the collecting of bodies, the storing of bodies and the dignified delivery of bodies to the next of kin,” he said.

New York City, which was one of the hot spots in the early days of the pandemic, quickly became the focus of Biggs’ attention.

“The first fatality estimates from the medical examiners were for 10,000 deaths in New York City alone in the 60 days between the end of March and the end of May,” he said. “That was a hard wake-up call for us. We knew that as the numbers got higher, the states were not equipped to handle that level of fatalities. The morgues and funeral homes were already at capacity.”

Right around then, the first refrigerated trucks designed to store bodies and which came to be known as “reaper trucks” were dispatched to New York City.

“It was a scramble for limited resources,” Biggs said. “In particular, human remains pouches (body bags) and N95 masks were in incredible demand.”

With scientists still uncertain about whether corpses could spread the disease, mortuary workers were zipping the victims into two bags at a time for extra protection, he said.

Biggs said one of his proudest moments came when he learned a National Guard company was heading to New York City without enough personal protective equipment, and he was able to pull a few strings to secure the needed gear.

But the dilemma from Day One was what to do with all the bodies. Nearly 52,000 people in New York state died due to Covid-19, most of them at the start of the pandemic.

“Early on, one idea that was floated was to use ice skating arenas as cold storage,” Biggs said. “That’s a bad idea. Human cells do not respond well to freezing temperatures. We wanted to make sure families got their loved ones back in a dignified manner, although we had no idea when that would be.”

He said he wasn’t surprised that cities and states were not prepared for so much death.

“All the cities and states have capacity when the death rate is constant,” he said. “There is enough morgue space. But here were thousands of deceased and that put real stress on the system. You couldn’t turn them over to the next of kin because the funeral homes were overwhelmed. And in places like Vermont, bodies couldn’t be buried in April because the ground was still frozen.”

The work, Biggs said, was grueling: “It started when the sun came up. Then it was meetings, phone calls, teleconferences, and all the while I was doing my civilian job, as well.”

He said he never felt overwhelmed because he had faith in FEMA and the Defense Department to handle this crisis, ""but we didn’t know when we would reach the peak.”

“We didn’t know if it was going to be 10,000 dead or if it would be 10 times more than that. And every day, I got my daily dose of depression.”

Then-President Donald Trump was downplaying the danger of Covid-19 and pushing to reopen the country over the objections of public health experts and much of the medical establishment.

Asked about that battle, Biggs declined to wade in with an opinion but insisted, “I did not see any politics in my orders.”

“There was a lot of conflicting theories from the experts about when normal life could return, when we would see a flattening of the curve,” he said. “But once it started spreading across Florida, across Texas and other states in the South and West, I knew this was not going to wrap up by Labor Day.”

Biggs' role in this drama ended in June as the number of coronavirus deaths flattened across the Northeast. He returned to civilian life until his most recent assignment at Medgar Evers.

Asked what he would tell his grandchildren about the pandemic, Biggs thought a moment, then said, ""Americans don’t give up.”

“We press on,” he said. “Yes, there are political and ideological divisions. But on the whole, we come together. We persevere.”",0
255,Countries emphasize importance of AstraZeneca shot as they look to alternatives,"Australia said on Friday it had ordered more alternatives for the AstraZeneca vaccine, setting back its vaccination rollout, and Hong Kong delayed deliveries of the shot amid concern about a possible very small risk of rare blood clots.

The Australian decision effectively puts paid to plans to have its entire population vaccinated by the end of October, highlighting the delicate public health balancing act the issue has created.

Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

Millions of doses of the AstraZeneca shot have been safely administered around the world and millions more have been ordered but some countries have limited its use to older age groups as a precaution while cases of clotting are investigated.

Australia said it had doubled its order of the Pfizer shot after health authorities recommended that those under 50 take it instead of AstraZeneca, which had been the mainstay of its vaccination program.

“It is not a prohibition on the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra. “For those who are over 50, there is a strong encouragement to be taking this AstraZeneca vaccine.”

The Anglo-Swedish company said it respected the Australian recommendation and was working with regulators around the world ""to understand the individual cases, epidemiology and possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events.""

European and British medicine regulators said this week they had found possible links with extremely rare cases of brain blood clots, while emphatically reaffirming the vaccine’s importance in mass vaccination against Covid-19.

The European Medicines Agency received reports of 169 cases of the rare brain blood clot by early April, after 34 million doses had been administered, Sabine Straus, chair of the EMA’s safety committee, said this week.

Most of the cases reported had occurred in women under 60.

On Friday, the EMA said that if a causal relationship is confirmed or considered likely, regulatory action will be needed to minimize risk. It also said it was looking into Johnson & Johnson’s shot over reports of blood clots.

The AstraZeneca shot is by far the cheapest and most high-volume vaccine launched so far, making it likely to be central to many of the worldwide inoculation programs that are vital to curbing the global pandemic and averting damaging lockdowns.

Germany, one of several European countries which have recommended alternatives to AstraZeneca for people under 60, said on Friday a surge in infections meant a new lockdown was needed.

“Every day in which we don’t act, we lose lives,” Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, said.

Global supply

Hong Kong Health Secretary Sophia Chan said the city would delay shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine it had ordered this year to avoid other countries going short.

“We believe that AstraZeneca vaccines will not need to be supplied to Hong Kong this year, so as not to cause a waste when the vaccine is still in short supply globally,” she said.

The government was considering buying a new type of vaccine that may offer better protection, she added.

The Chinese-ruled city had ordered 7.5 million AstraZeneca doses, which were scheduled to arrive in the second half of 2021. But Chan said the global financial center had sufficient alternatives.

Costa Rica said on Thursday it would use the AstraZeneca shot after assessing the EMA’s guidance.

More than 40,000 doses of the vaccine arrived in the country on Wednesday, the first delivery under an agreement for a million vaccines with the COVAX mechanism of the World Health Organization and GAVI alliance to ensure vaccines reach poorer states.

All the countries recommending age limits have emphasized that the vaccine is effective and its benefits far outweigh the risks of catching Covid-19 for older people.

The top health body in France, where vaccine hesitancy is high, recommended on Friday that those over 55 who had received a first dose of the AstraZeneca shot be given an alternative for the second one.

The Haute Autorite de la Sante suggested they get a new-style messenger-RNA vaccine, confirming an earlier Reuters exclusive. Two such vaccines, one from Pfizer and BioNTech and another from Moderna, have been approved for use in France.

Messenger RNA vaccines prompt the human body to make a protein that mimics part of the virus, triggering an immune response. AstraZeneca’s shot generates an immune response using a harmless, weakened version of a chimpanzee common cold virus.

The French health body also said there should be an interval of 12 weeks between the two shots in such cases and recommended a study to assess the immune responses given by these mixed vaccine prescriptions.

256,Dam safety advocates feel forgotten in Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan,"When President Joe Biden last week introduced a sweeping $2 trillion infrastructure plan, the details read like a Christmas wish list for people hoping to see more federal spending on roads, bridges, airports, schools and other deteriorating public resources.

But while the long list of projects in what Biden called a “once-in-a-generation investment in America” seems exhaustive, some advocates, including those concerned about the threat posed by aging dams, are concerned that their priorities are getting short shrift.

“I read it like three times and I’m like, ‘Am I missing something here?’” said Lori Spragens, executive director of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials, who noted that the urgent need to repair crumbling dams that threaten lives and property across the country gets only a passing mention in the nearly 12,000-word fact sheet the administration released.

“We have 90,000 dams in America, and so many of those dams are aging and in need of upgrades,” Spragens said, adding that $20 billion is needed just to repair dams in high-population areas where a failure could be catastrophic. “If you’re going to spend $2 trillion on a plan to improve the nation’s infrastructure, we think it’s very important that some of this infrastructure funding go to a serious public safety issue that affects every state in America.”

The White House declined to comment, but an administration official noted that Biden’s plan calls for spending $17 billion on ports and waterways, which would include locks and dams. But the fact that dams are barely mentioned in the proposal has advocates gearing up to fight for their cause.

They’re among many interest groups angling for a larger share of the potentially massive spending plan, ramping up the political challenge for Biden as he tries to convince skeptical members of Congress to support the plan despite its price tag and its call for corporate tax hikes.

Everything is still being negotiated, said Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who has been a strong voice for dam safety since the catastrophic failure of two Michigan dams last year forced the evacuation of 10,000 people, damaged or destroyed 2,500 properties, submerged the city of Midland under 9 feet of water and drained two lakes, turning them into soggy empty pits.",0
257,Biden to form commission to study Supreme Court changes,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden will sign an executive order Friday establishing a commission to study overhauling the Supreme Court, following through on a campaign promise, the White House announced.

The topics that the commission will examine include the length of service and turnover of justices on the court, its membership and size, and its case selection, rules and practices, the White House said in a statement.

""The commission’s purpose is to provide an analysis of the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform,"" the White House said.

The commission will be made up of a bipartisan group of scholars with expertise in constitutional law, history and political science, as well as former federal judges and court reform advocates. The committee will hold public meetings to hear from outside voices and will be directed to complete a report within 180 days of its first public meeting.

While the executive order doesn't require the commission to provide Biden with specific recommendations, the panel's report would will affect Biden’s ""thinking moving forward,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday.

White House aides told NBC News in January that they were working to set up the commission as part of their mission to shape the courts after Republicans overhauled them in the last four years.

Biden was reluctant during his campaign to embrace the idea of court expansion despite pressure from Democrats after then-President Donald Trump's decision to quickly fill the Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just weeks before the election.

In an interview with ""60 Minutes"" in October, Biden committed to establishing a ""bipartisan commission of scholars"" but said that their purpose would not be focused on ""court packing,"" or adding seats to the court.

""There’s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated, and I’ve looked to see what recommendations that commission might make,"" he said at the time.

The White House said Friday that Bob Bauer, a professor at New York University School of Law and a former White House counsel, and Cristina Rodriguez, a professor at Yale Law School and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, will co-chair the commission.",0
258,Texas GOP recruiting 'army' to fight voter fraud in largely minority areas of Houston,"Texas Republicans are working to recruit a “army” of 10,000 poll workers and watchers to fight voter fraud in Houston, leaked video of a Harris County Republican Party presentation reveals.

“We’re trying to build an army here — 10,000 people in Harris County,” a man who identifies himself as an official with the county Republican Party said in the video, released by advocacy group Common Cause Texas.

The official said he is seeking volunteers from the suburbs where he lives “that will have the confidence and courage to come down here in these areas,” he said, pointing to Houston’s diverse urban center on a map of voting precincts.

“This is where the problems occur,” he said. “If we don’t do that, this fraud down here is really going to continue.”

Common Cause Texas said the presentation, which is dated March 10, was circulated online by the Harris County Republican Party.

“The impetus for releasing right now is there are some bills in the legislature that seek to empower poll watchers in some really scary ways, and also at the same time, take away the power of the presiding judge at the poll site from being able to remove a disruptive poll watcher,” said Anthony Gutierrez, executive director of Common Cause Texas. The group blurred out the Republican official's name from his presentation for his privacy.

Harris County GOP Chair Cindy Siegel confirmed in a statement to NBC News that the program aims to recruit ""an army of volunteers"" throughout the county as a way ""to engage voters for the whole ballot, top to bottom, and ensure every legal vote is counted.” Siegel also called Common Cause ""a radical leftist group that is blatantly mischaracterizing a grassroots election worker recruitment video in a shameful effort to bully and intimidate Republicans.""

Former President Donald Trump's repeated falsehoods that the election was stolen from him has inspired an avalanche of election-related bills nationwide, and Republicans in Texas have advanced several measures aimed at fighting voter fraud. Several of the bills appear to focus on how Harris County ran their elections last year, banning the overnight and drive-thru early voting options offered there.

Two restrictive election bills, Senate Bill 7 and House Bill 6, are advancing through the Texas legislature and would give partisan poll watchers the power to videotape potential wrongdoing. The legislation would make it a crime to obstruct a poll watcher's view, and election workers would be barred from removing them from a polling site. Advocates fear such power would allow poll watchers to intimidate voters.

Corporations recently began publicly pressuring states including Texas not to pass legislation that makes it harder to vote — with American Airlines and tech billionaire Michael Dell speaking out about those two bills — but Texas Republicans have pushed back angrily.

By all accounts, the 2020 election was secure and the results were accurate. Trump's attorney general, William Barr, said there was no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and Trump's legal efforts to overturn the results failed in courtrooms around the country.

Still, almost two-thirds of Republicans believe that President Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election, even as more than six-in-10 Americans overall believe he won fair and square, according to a Monmouth University poll released last month.

This video signals that efforts to fight fraud are brewing within the party's rank and file, too.

""The language being used in the video was one of the most alarming things, when you think about the rhetoric that led to the insurrection at the capitol,"" Gutierrez said. ""These are the same dog whistles I’m hearing in this video.""

Gutierrez said he is encouraging supporters to pressure businesses, in addition to legislators.

""We’re definitely hopeful that the video, and just putting a real face and sounds to what the suppression is going to look like in practice, helps get a lot more leaders and business to speak out against the bill,"" he said.

In the video, the Republican official said he hopes to build a standing “election integrity brigade” instead of recruiting before each election. The county GOP aims to recruit and train 2,500 people by October 2021, growing to reach the full 10,000 volunteers by September 2022 by means of the existing precinct chairs and ""military partnerships,"" the official said.",0
259,First Biden budget outline calls for major boost in nondefense spending,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Friday released the outlines of his first budget proposal to Congress, a $1.5 trillion blueprint that calls for a significant increase in nondefense spending in areas ranging from climate change to gun violence.

Biden is targeting funding increases in areas he campaigned heavily on, including a $20 billion boost for schools in low-income areas, the creation of a $6.5 billion medical research program with a focus on cancer, and a $14 billion increase in funds across the federal government to tackle climate change.

The budget also calls for a slight increase in defense spending, which would primarily be used to fund military salary increases, an administration official said.

The budget blueprint will be used as a starting point for Congress as it makes the final determination on how to appropriate funds. While what is ultimately signed into law will likely be vastly different, the proposal gives a window into where the president’s priorities lie.

The budget proposal comes as Biden seeks an additional $2 trillion from Congress to fund an infrastructure plan that would direct billions toward everything from roads and bridges to clean energy and broadband. Administration officials said the budget request was “complimentary” to that bill.

The proposal released Friday covers only discretionary spending, which accounts for about a quarter of total federal spending. The full budget, which will include nondiscretionary spending like Social Security and Medicare, as well as tax proposals, is set to be released later this spring.

Funding for areas outside of defense, like education and public health, lagged behind its historical levels under the Trump administration. The $769 billion for nondefense spending that Biden is proposing would be a 16 percent increase over 2021 enacted levels and would account for about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product — roughly the historic average over the last 30 years, an administration official said.

Biden’s proposal sets aside $753 billion for all national defense programs across the government, a 1.7 percent increase over fiscal 2021. While an increase, that’s a shift from the Trump administration, which heavily prioritized military spending. Nondefense discretionary spending has been shrinking relative to the overall economy for the past decade because of budget caps imposed by Congress a decade ago.

Some Democrats in Congress had been pressing for Biden to cut defense spending in his first budget proposal. When accounting for inflation, Biden’s $715 billion funding for the Defense Department would amount to a slight decrease in real world dollars.

The budget outline was expected last week, but administration officials said the budget process was delayed because Trump administration officials refused to fully cooperate during the transition. Biden is also without a confirmed budget director after his nominee, Neera Tanden, withdrew from consideration after it appeared she didn’t have the votes to get confirmed. The office is being run by acting director Shalanda Young.

Among the areas administration officials highlighted in the budget were an increase of $3.9 billion to fight the opioid epidemic; $30.4 billion for housing vouchers aimed at reducing homelessness; and a total of $8.7 billion for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare for future public health crises.

The budget would also include $2.1 billion to the Justice Department to address gun violence, representing an increase of $232 million, and $1 billion to the Justice Department for Violence Against Women Act programs, nearly double the 2021 level.

To address the root causes of migration that has caused an influx of immigrants to the southern border in recent months, Biden’s budget allocates $861 billion as a “first step toward a four-year commitment.""

The Budget Control Act imposed budget limits through 2021 and included $1.2 trillion in automatically scheduled cuts to defense and nondefense discretionary spending to encourage Republicans and Democrats to reach a larger deal on taxes and spending to avert them.",0
260,Congress introduces 'No Hate Act' amid rise in racist and faith-based attacks,"A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation on Thursday to help combat the recent rise in hate crimes across the country.

The bill, called the No Hate Act, would streamline the national reporting systems used by law enforcement, train law enforcement on investigating hate crimes, create a hate crimes hotline, establish programs to rehabilitate offenders and expand assistance and resources for victims of hate crimes.

The legislation was introduced on Thursday in the House and will be introduced Monday in Senate. It is led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., and Reps. Don Beyer, D-Va., Fred Upton, R-Mich., Judy Chu, D-Calif., and Vern Buchanan, R-Fla.

“Hate crimes are so insidious because they’re intended to harm and terrorize an entire community, not just one person or property. We know that hate crimes are on the rise, but individual viral videos — no matter how horrifying and stomach churning — only tell part of the story,"" Blumenthal said in a statement. ""Better reporting might sound basic, but it’s absolutely fundamental to understanding and addressing the full scope of the problem.

The bill bears the name of Khalid Jabara, an Oklahoma man of Lebanese descent shot to death by his white neighbor in 2016, and Heather Heyer, a counterprotester killed at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.

State legislatures have also introduced or passed bills in response to the rise in hate crime incidents.

In 2019 — the most recent data — the FBI reported 7,314 hate crime incidents compared to 7,120 in 2018, a roughly 3 percent increase. However, anti-hate crime groups believe that these incidents are underreported.

A recent analysis of police department statistics revealed that the United States experienced a significant hike in anti-Asian hate crimes last year across major cities, spurred in large part by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The analysis released last month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino examined hate crimes in 16 of America’s largest cities. It revealed that while such crimes in 2020 decreased overall by 7 percent, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150 percent.

“Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans across the nation have been terrified by the alarming surge in anti-Asian hate and violence,” said Chu. ""We know that many hate crimes are never documented by local law enforcement and reported to the FBI, which is why we still do not have a complete understanding of the problem.""",0
261,The Derek Chauvin trial is ‘opening old wounds’ for police violence victims,"Even though it has been nearly four years since a jury acquitted Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Officer Betty Shelby in the killing of Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old father of four, his twin remembers the trial like it was yesterday.

“What was mainly heart-wrenching was to hear her, see her, the person who killed my brother. She showed no remorse,” Tiffany Crutcher recalled.

Terence Crutcher was standing near his car when Tulsa police officers, including Shelby, responded to a call about a stalled vehicle in September 2016. Shelby said she shot Terence in self-defense as he reached into his car. But video of the shooting showed his hands in the air as he moved closer to his vehicle. Shelby was charged with manslaughter.

“They played the video, they slowed it down,” Tiffany Crutcher said. “We saw the blood and we heard everything. That was my brother’s blood. I had to put my head in my lap, my dad had to hold my hand. They did everything to vilify my brother. And I ran out of the courtroom, I broke out crying.”

She went on to start the Terence Crutcher Foundation in her brother’s honor to combat police brutality in Tulsa. But the trial still affects the family years later, she said.

“We have to relive it every day we wake up,” she said.

Today, George Floyd’s family is enduring this retraumatization during former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin’s trial. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, after kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes last year.

For more than a week, Floyd’s relatives have repeatedly listened to the details of his death and watched footage of the final moments of his life. Floyd’s nephew, Brandon Williams, said he walked out of the courtroom because he couldn’t bear to watch the graphic video. Floyd’s brother, Philonise, said recently that it was “heart-wrenching” to relive his brother’s killing.

“It was an emotional day, sitting there watching my brother being tortured to death, screaming for our mom, talking about his kids,” Philonise Floyd said. “It was devastating.”

Mental health professionals have, in recent years, highlighted the emotional and psychological toll racist violence can have on Black people. From videos of police brutality to watching criminal trials with bated breath, the stress of such experiences is well-documented. But for the families of victims of police violence, emotional stressors are heightened, said Maysa Akbar, chief diversity officer of the American Psychological Association and the author of “Urban Trauma: A Legacy of Racism.”

While the world watches the attempt to serve legal justice for another person killed by police, Akbar notes that for the family involved, justice in court doesn’t always amount to healing.

“There is going to be retraumatization that will and can occur every single time the story is retold,” she said. “There is racial trauma that has been persistent throughout this entire situation, from the moment of George Floyd's"" death, all the way through ""this entire process.”

While Black people watching the case from afar can experience “vicarious trauma” — the emotional impact of being exposed to another person’s pain — there is a particular plight that belongs solely to those closest to the victims. Experts have said relatives of victims of police violence can experience physical and emotional manifestations of trauma including effects on long-term mental health, survivor's guilt and even post-traumatic stress disorder.

“Racial trauma is an emotional injury. It’s absolutely heightened with the families,” Akbar added. “It’s going to impact the way they’re going to be able to move forward as a family. There’s no amount of justice that will ever justify what happened to George Floyd and the impact it has on the family.”

A 2009 study found that “post-conflict justice” efforts such as trials and truth commissions don’t necessarily heal clinical psychological trauma like PTSD, and such events can actually leave people feeling hopeless and aggravate their psychological wounds. However, in 2004, a study noted that criminal proceedings may not have a great negative impact on victims. But the family of Jordan Edwards, a 15-year-old shot to death by then-police Officer Roy Oliver in Balch Springs, Texas, in 2017, has a different experience.

“It’s never-ending,” Odell Edwards, Jordan’s father, said of the experience. He added that the Chauvin trial isn’t easy to hear about. “It brings back so many memories about what I went through. It was hard during the trial, seeing the guy that did that to my son. Every day it was hard for me. I had a hard time sleeping.”

Jordan was riding in a Chevrolet Impala with two brothers and two of his friends the night of April 29, 2017. Police responded to a call about a noisy house party and saw the car outside. Oliver testified that he thought the car was going to hit his partner and so he fired inside, killing Jordan. Oliver was convicted of murder and sentenced to 15 years in prison.

“Odell has had to continuously relive this with his family,” the family’s attorney Daryl Washington said of Jordan's father. “It’s been really tough. Talking to Odell, whenever there’s a trial or a police shooting, it’s almost like opening old wounds again for the family.”

Although Oliver is among very few police officers to be convicted of murder, Edwards said he doesn’t feel 15 years is enough time for the man who killed his son. And for Tiffany Crutcher, the pain of seeing Shelby all but absolved of her brother’s slaying only adds to the trauma of the event, she said.

“After the ‘not guilty’ verdict, we were all numb. For the jury to say ‘we don’t feel that she’s blameless’ … that was another blow,” she said. “We thought we were on the pathway to justice. And after the verdict, you see the tears of grown men and community and friends, in pictures you see folks on their knees wailing because we didn’t get justice.”

Akbar said that because “seeking justice doesn’t equate to healing,” it’s important for families to have access to resources such as therapy and counseling to minimize the emotional tax of criminal trials. She said such psychological well-being requires an intentional approach, and highlighted the importance of being in community with others.

“Become part of a grief group with others who have experienced something similar,” she advised. “The family isn't able to shut out what is happening in front of them, but there are ways they can minimize the impact through psychological help and support.”

262,"Manufacturers embrace robots, the perfect pandemic worker","Automation and digitization were already spreading to more factory floors and job sites. Then the pandemic hit.

“It was trial by fire as we went through Covid,” said Mark Bulanda, executive president of automation solutions for Emerson, a manufacturer of systems that automate factory processes.

“Not because of Covid, but because the exodus of people forced the adoption of tech.”

The latest jobs report shows the manufacturing sector grew at its fastest level since the pandemic began, jumping by 50,000 positions. However, there are still about half a million fewer employed manufacturing workers than there were a year ago. The question is how many of those jobs will come back — and how many have been permanently disrupted by digital processes.

Since the pandemic hit, food manufacturers ramped up their automation, allowing facilities to maintain output while social distancing. Factories digitized controls on their machines so they could be remotely operated by workers working from home or another location. New sensors were installed that can flag, or predict, failures, allowing teams of inspectors operating on a schedule to be reduced to an as-needed maintenance crew.

Now, manufacturers are clamoring for even more automated machines so they can cope with spiking demand for their products amid a global recovery and a skilled labor shortage.

Rockwell Automation, a provider of industrial automation solutions, said growth is up 6 percent for the fiscal year and saw sharply increased orders in November and December.

Orders for automated machines are up 30 percent at Eastman Machine Company, a Buffalo, New York-based manufacturer that produces machines that cut specialty materials like carbon fiber and fiberglass, increasingly in demand for cars, aerospace and wind turbines. The backlog for a new device extends to June, their longest in company history.

“When you automate systems, you get greater accuracy,” said CEO Robert Stevenson. “Repeatability is increased. It’s hard to find people who can do that.”

During the pandemic, his own production lines were affected. State-mandated capacity restraints meant he had to temporarily lay off half his staff. Work stations were distanced and assembly was broken into stages so that only one worker was working on a part at a time. He’s since been able to hire them all back.

Now, his biggest issues are booking container ships to send his product to customers amid a global shipping snarl, and finding workers with technical skills and aptitude.

“People need to be trained,” he said. “It’s not a robot, you need operators.”

Yet it’s estimated every one automated device replaces six human workers, according to Daron Acemoglu, an MIT professor of economics who studies the effects on labor. While about three of the displaced workers will find other jobs, the other workers ""withdraw from the labor force,"" he said, with the greatest labor force participation happening among prime age males without college degrees.

Robots could replace as many as 2 million more workers in manufacturing by 2025, Acemoglu found, contributing to wage inequality, a slowdown in labor demand, and an even higher share of GDP going to the owners of capital than labor.

""Typically, automation tends to have a range of negative effects on workers, but then it is counterbalanced by other technological changes that create opportunities,"" Acemoglu said.

But this time around, those displaced workers are going into lower-skilled and lower pay occupations, such as factory workers who are now security guards or warehouse workers, unless they're able to upgrade their education into a new technical job, or engineering or management, he said, placing more burden on the worker to adapt.

""We're not training workers for the new types of jobs that may exist,"" Acemoglu said. ""We have failed to create the requisite technologies to generate enough opportunities for these workers.""

“The high upfront cost for developing and implementing machines in factories has been compensated by the pandemic discouraging human work.""

“The high upfront cost for developing and implementing machines in factories has been compensated by the pandemic discouraging human work,” Hyejin Youn, assistant professor of management and organization at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, wrote in an email.

“Once the level of development and implementation and production goes beyond the threshold to get into the… learning curve, the cost will decrease, [making machines] cheaper than human workers,” she wrote. Lower-skilled workers are the most vulnerable to automation, she said.

But manufacturers of automated products say these effects, far from being anti-labor, can free up workers to be redeployed elsewhere, put to better use, or eventually allow for more workers to be hired.

“The most competitive industrial enterprise combines advanced tech with a workforce comfortable with interacting with that tech and is valued for uniquely human attributes like decision-making skills,” said Blake Moret, chairman and CEO of Rockwell Automation.

“If you combine a skilled and engaged workforce with advanced tech, you make a more successful company that can do more, hire more people, and profitably engage in new lines of business,” he said. “It’s a beneficial spiral.”

Boston Dynamics, known for its viral videos of spindly legged robot dogs and backflipping humanoid bots this year unveiled Stretch, its first purpose-built robot for warehouse automation. It has suction grippers built onto an arm that can grab boxes and move them onto a pallet or conveyor belt. It can lift up to 50 pounds and move 800 boxes an hour and can be quickly deployed without needing much additional infrastructure.

For years the warehousing industry has known that its growth was going to run into labor shortages, said Brian Nachtigall, Boston Dynamics' director of business development for warehouse automation.

“What happened in the past year was the pandemic,” he said. “A flashlight really shined on this issue for a lot of people.”

Nachtigall said he sees Stretch as a tool that warehouse workers will use, rather than an outright replacement for them. Workers will still need to check in trucks, open their doors, and enable a robot, or several, to unload the trucks. The company says a few customers will deploy Stretch in early 2022, but declined to say which.

“Some people talk about a ‘lights-out’ warehouse,” he said, describing a warehouse running completely on automation that would not need any humans — or lights.

“That’s probably pretty far off. There’s going to be people managing robots for quite some time in the future.”",0
263,The 'blue wall of silence' is crumbling in the Derek Chauvin trial. Why this case could be a tipping point.,"During his lengthy testimony Monday, Minneapolis' police chief minced no words in condemning the actions of Derek Chauvin, the former officer who is charged with murder in the death of George Floyd.

""To continue to apply that level of force to a person proned out, handcuffed behind their back, that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,"" Chief Medaria Arradondo said. ""It is not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics or values.""

Arradondo's testimony should have come as no surprise. In his opening statement, prosecutor Jerry Blackwell told jurors that Arradondo wouldn't hold back in his assessment that Chauvin used ""excessive force"" when he knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds last May.

Still, Arradondo's testimony was rare. That he was joined by a string of other law enforcement officers was remarkable.

Among those joining Arradondo on the stand as prosecution witnesses were Lt. Richard Zimmerman, the longest-serving officer in the Minneapolis Police Department, and Inspector Katie Blackwell, who at the time of Floyd's death was the commander of the training division.

Sgt. David Pleoger, Chauvin's former supervisor, also admonished his actions. Pleoger testified last week that, among other things, when Floyd ""was no longer offering up any resistance to the officers, they could have ended their restraint,"" and that Chauvin didn't initially divulge that he had knelt on Floyd's neck.

Arradondo, Zimmerman, Pleoger and Blackwell didn't protect Chauvin behind the so-called blue wall of silence for various reasons, legal and law enforcement experts say. The ""blue wall of silence"" describes an unofficial oath among police officers not to report a colleague's wrongdoing, including crimes.

Paul Butler, a law professor at Georgetown University Law Center and former federal prosecutor, said the blue wall means ""that sometimes police officers close rank and — right or wrong — they're blue.""

Many times when police officers are charged with killing someone, it is because they shot the person, said Butler, an MSNBC legal analyst who is also a contributing columnist for The Washington Post.

""The act of shooting someone requires a split-second decision,"" he said.

In those instances, police officers might be reluctant to testify against a colleague in part because they resent being second-guessed by people who don't know the dangers of their profession, Butler said in an interview Wednesday.

Chauvin's restraint of Floyd, however, was measured, Butler said.

""He had 9 minutes and 29 seconds to consider his actions,"" he said.

The international protests against racism and police brutality spurred by Floyd's death also may be a reason the blue wall of silence has crumbled, Butler said.

""I think the officers who are testifying want to model what good cops look like, both for the jury and the public, in contrast to Chauvin,"" he said. ""I've been impressed by how many officers are willing to go on the record about how Chauvin violated both police procedures and criminal law.""

Zimmerman made a series of damning statements Friday about Chauvin's actions.

""Pulling him down to the ground facedown and putting your knee on a neck for that amount of time, it's just uncalled for,"" said Zimmerman, who joined the department in 1985 and leads its homicide unit.

Zimmerman responded to the scene after Floyd was taken away in an ambulance. He testified that what Chauvin had done was ""totally unnecessary."" He said he saw ""no reason for why the officers felt they were in danger — if that's what they felt — and that's what they would have to feel to be able to use that kind of force.""

His testimony was compelling, Butler said, because police witnesses are often reluctant to draw conclusions like that because either they don't want to be part of getting an officer convicted or they want the jury to determine whether the force was excessive.

That hasn't been the case for some of Chauvin's former colleagues.

Arradondo, the city's first Black police chief, also testified in the trial of Mohamed Noor, a former police officer who was accused of murder in the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called the police to report hearing what she thought was a sexual assault of a woman in an alley behind her home. Noor was convicted of third-degree murder.

DeLacy Davis, who retired as a sergeant with the East Orange Police Department in New Jersey in 2006, said it is rare for a police chief to testify against an officer in a criminal case.

Davis, a use-of-force and community policing expert, said he believes there are three reasons Arradondo testified against Chauvin, the first being that Chauvin's actions were ""egregious.""

Davis said that was evidenced by how quickly Arradondo fired the four officers involved in Floyd's arrest. They were fired May 26 — the day after Floyd died. Typically, Davis said, police chiefs will wait weeks or months to discipline officers for misconduct — if they do at all — and, in most cases, only after facing public pressure.

The second reason he believes Arradondo testified was to bolster morale.

""To also support the men and women who are still working in Minneapolis but have to somehow pick up their morale and re-center their practice as professional law enforcement officers, he needed to send a very clear message,"" Davis said. ""And I think he did that.""

Davis said Arradondo did not ""condemn all of policing — he condemned the actions of the four involved officers."" Davis quoted Arradondo's statement in June saying Floyd's death was a ""murder"" that one of the responding officers had caused and the three ""others failed to prevent.""

Davis, who is Black, said he believes race also influenced Arradondo's decision to testify.

""Being a police chief of color, he has clearly demonstrated either the unwillingness or the inability to detach his melanin from the reality of what Black and brown people experience at the hands of law enforcement in this country,"" Davis said. ""Because my experience has been, even with Black officers, they'll toe the company line.""

Davis said he believes the Minneapolis police officers condemned Chauvin's actions because his actions were ""indefensible.""

""They could not defend it without shaming their entire agency,"" he said.

Floyd, who was Black, had been accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a convenience store. He was recorded on widely seen bystander video handcuffed, facedown on the pavement, telling the officers he couldn't breathe.

Katie Blackwell, the inspector who took the stand Monday, said that she has known Chauvin for about 20 years and that he had received annual training in defensive tactics and use of force. She said he would have been trained to use one or two arms — not his knee — in a neck restraint.

After the prosecution showed her a photo of Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck, she said, ""I don't know what kind of improvised position that is.""

Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, has argued that Floyd's use of illegal drugs and his underlying health conditions caused his death, not Chauvin's kneeling on him, as prosecutors have said.

The county medical examiner's office classified Floyd's death as a homicide — a death caused by someone else. The report said Floyd died of ""cardiopulmonary arrest, complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression."" Under ""other significant conditions,"" it said Floyd suffered from hypertensive heart disease and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors weren't listed under cause of death.

Davis said he believes Floyd's death was the result of a split-second decision.

""I believe Derek Chauvin made a split-second decision that George Floyd was not worthy of any of the basic humanity that he was pleading for,"" he said. ""I hope this is a tipping point in law enforcement that we are now seeing officers of many races speaking up and speaking out.""",0
264,"Suicidal thoughts are increasing in young kids, experts say. It began before the pandemic.","The youngsters come in with tears in their eyes, or their fists clenched in anger. Sometimes, they show no emotion at all.

“I want to kill myself,” the kids, some as young as 8, announce inside elementary school counselor Olivia Carter’s office, where affirmations such as “Think good thoughts” and “Our school is not complete without you!” adorn the walls.

When Carter started working at Jefferson Elementary in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, in 2016, there was a school suicide protocol in place to ensure that students who expressed a desire to hurt themselves got the help they needed. Her first year, she only had to use it once or twice.

Now, she says, about one student a month at her pre-K through fifth grade school tells her that they want to die.

“Some of them will ask, ‘What does it mean to die? What happens when you die?’” Carter said. “Those existential conversations are very difficult at this level. But I would say a good number of kids understand what it means to end their life by suicide.”

While suicidal thoughts and self-harm have been well documented in teenagers, mental health experts say too little attention has been paid to young children, despite growing evidence that more elementary and middle school students are in crisis.

""No matter how young they are, we take it very seriously"" when students express the desire to kill themselves, said elementary school counselor Olivia Carter. Courtesy of Olivia Carter

There is limited data about these younger age groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not include elementary or middle school students in its biannual youth survey of risky behaviors. And suicides among children 10 and younger remain rare, with 29 reported in 2019, according to the CDC.

But in interviews, more than a dozen mental health professionals, including school counselors, social workers, psychiatrists and suicidologists, said they are seeing more children as young as kindergarten who are in dire need of support.

The number of children ages 6-12 who visited children’s hospitals for suicidal thoughts or self-harm has more than doubled since 2016, according to data from 46 such facilities across the country collected for NBC News by the Children’s Hospital Association, a trade organization.

The association documented 5,485 emergency room or inpatient visits for suicidal thoughts and self-harm among 6- to-12-year-olds at these hospitals in 2019, up from 2,555 in 2016. (Full data isn’t yet available for 2020, but in the first three quarters of the year, there were 3,503 such visits.) Visits for teenagers with suicidal thoughts or self-harm at these hospitals also rose from 2016 to 2019, but at a slower rate — by 44 percent, compared to 115 percent for younger children.

The rise in troubled young children is evident around the country.

At the Children’s Center, a youth mental health clinic for children 8 and younger in Salt Lake City, the “phones have not stopped ringing” with families seeking care, CEO Rebecca Dutson said.

At the Riverbend Center for Mental Health, which works with several school districts in northwest Alabama, staff members documented a 55 percent increase from 2018 to 2019 in safety plans for children ages 6-13 who were at risk of hurting themselves.

And at the Children’s Minnesota hospital system, even as the volume of patients declined during the coronavirus pandemic, the number seeking care for mental health stayed consistent.

“I see kids where multigenerational drug abuse, mental health issues and poverty have all worked together to create several generations of really, really unwell people,” said Lori Chaffin-Britt, intensive treatment programs director at The Child Center, a mental health agency in western Oregon where staff members have noticed more behavioral problems in children as young as 5. “I see more kids looking sicker, earlier.”

Now, mental health experts fear that the pandemic — which has increased anxiety and depression among adults and teenagers, and resulted in an estimated 37,300 children losing a parent to Covid-19 — could compound the issues young children face.

""It’s probably going to be worse for those that were already struggling or were already disadvantaged by society,” said Jonathan Singer, president of the American Association of Suicidology and an associate professor of social work at Loyola University Chicago. ""Little kids have essentially lost a year of socialization.""

I see more kids looking sicker, earlier. Lori Chaffin-Britt, intensive treatment programs director at The Child Center in western Oregon

The past year has brought more public awareness to youth mental health, with advocates calling for more research into the problem’s scope and causes. They also want to see more investment in potential solutions, including increased access to school counselors amid a national shortage.

Yet, among the challenges: It is not always clear what the best treatment is for very young patients.

“There are problems with admitting them into the hospital, because they have anxiety from being away from their parents,” said Dr. Meghan Schott, medical director of psychiatric emergency services at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., where about 30 to 40 percent of psychiatric emergency room visits are elementary and middle school children. “There’s not a lot of services geared toward younger kids.”

Why are more children in crisis?

The reason more young children are seeking help is not entirely understood. Research into what leads a child to contemplate suicide at this age is limited, but experts see multiple factors at play.

Counselors point to online bullying and an increased use of social media starting at a young age. More children are getting their first cellphone in elementary school, and then stay up late checking it, counselors said.

For children of immigrant families, one clinician noted the toll of changes to immigration policy in recent years; a 2018 study based on interviews with more than 200 Latino parents found both adults and children in their families had higher levels of anxiety due to fears of deportation and anti-immigrant rhetoric. Poverty has an impact too, experts said, as the percentage of children eligible for free or reduced-price lunch jumped to 52 percent from 38 percent over the past two decades.

“If housing is unstable, if there is food instability, that all contributes to anxiety and stress, even for students as young as I have,” said Carter, the Missouri school counselor. Nearly all the students at her school meet federal qualifications for free or reduced lunch.

One study last year analyzing more than 11,000 9- and 10-year-olds in the United States found that 1.3 percent reported they had tried to kill themselves, while 9.1 percent reported engaging in self-harm. It also concluded that family conflict and financial adversity were significantly associated with suicidal thoughts in these children.

We need to try to figure out why they're making these attempts at such a young age. Diana Whalen, psychiatry professor at Washington University School of Medicine

But Diana Whalen, one of the study's authors, said more research is needed.

""We need to try to figure out why they're making these attempts at such a young age,"" said Whalen, a psychiatry professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. ""We need to open our eyes to the fact that this is going on.""

Financial factors may be especially prevalent among children of color, who are far more likely to live in poverty than their white classmates. A 2016 study found that children ages 5 to 11 who die by suicide were more likely to be Black and male, compared to children ages 12 through 14 who killed themselves.

Yet, research has shown Black, Latino and Native American children are less likely than white children to have access to mental health care services — often due to lack of insurance or unavailability of mental health clinics in their neighborhoods. A study published this week found that Latino children are nearly three times as likely as white children to face delays in being seen in the emergency room for a mental health concern.

“The Latino and African American communities are willing to embrace services that are culturally sensitive, and available, and meet the parents where they’re at,” said Bridgette Mitchell Sanders, a registered play therapist of nearly 25 years in Los Angeles. “Sometimes services aren’t that. They require the parents to do activities beyond their work day, and sometimes parents have multiple jobs or transportation issues.”

In a best-case scenario, the experts said, more children are getting help for mental health issues because there is more awareness and less stigma attached to seeking care at this age.

Whalen said many of her teenage clients say they have had suicidal thoughts since elementary school — but were not taken seriously by their parents when they expressed them.

""It's kind of brushed off or ignored, but they are having these intense emotions and they need to be helped much sooner,"" she said.

Recognizing signs of distress

Depression and self-harm do not necessarily look the same in young children as they do in teens and adults.

A child might suddenly show less interest in playing outside or struggle with schoolwork or display new behavioral problems, said Renée Turner, a licensed professional counselor and registered play therapist who practices in San Antonio. Rather than stating outright that they are contemplating suicide, the children she treats may say things like, “What would the world look like without me?” or “It was a mistake to have me.”

Sanders said many times, expressing a desire to die is “really a way for children to express the amount of pain they are in.”

“In their minds, they want to cease to exist because it means being away from the pain,” she said.

While adolescents might engage in high-risk behaviors as a form of self-harm, Wesley Puckett, a licensed social worker for Lauderdale County Schools in Alabama, has worked with elementary school children who hurt themselves by aggressively rubbing an eraser into their arm, or by banging against a wall.

Self-harm and later suicide attempts have some overlap, but these behaviors are not necessarily an indication that someone is suicidal; experts say they’re often an attempt at self-soothing.

The reasons children give for self-harming range from being grounded for failing a class to grieving the loss of a parent, Puckett said.

In his district, social workers often find out a child is having a mental health crisis through software that detects when a student searches for something that causes concern on a school-issued device. Counselors may then call their caregivers.

“With a lot of parents, they’re just blown away that they’re getting this call from a school,” Puckett said. “They’ll say, ‘I never would’ve known my kid is thinking about this stuff.’”

This is consistent with research. Last year’s study on 9- and 10-year-olds found parents and caregivers were unaware their children had tried to kill themselves in 88 percent of the cases, and half didn’t know their children had thought about suicide.

Last summer, Brandy Bielicki experienced how rapidly a mental health crisis can overtake a child when her 10-year-old daughter, Kodie Dutcher, died by suicide in Baraboo, Wisconsin.

Kodie was an easygoing girl, who liked to keep her hair in a ponytail. She never argued if her mother said she couldn’t afford to buy something at a store, Bielicki said, and she loved to FaceTime with relatives.

On the evening of July 6, Kodie wrote a short note and left the house without shoes. Authorities found her body nearby the next day; police said her death was a suicide.

Bielicki, 31, said she was very close with her daughter and didn’t see any signs Kodie felt suicidal. There were no clues in the girl’s diary or text messages, she said, and teachers at school told her they hadn’t noticed anything unusual.

A registered nurse, Bielicki had been trained to spot signs of suicidal thoughts, but the guidance wasn’t specific to young children. She said everything had seemed so normal; she and Kodie were about to leave for vacation, and her daughter had just lost a tooth.

She believes her daughter had acted on an impulse and may not have known the consequences of her actions or that help was available.

“My 10-year-old probably didn’t know there was a suicide hotline number,” she said.

Asking the question

A silver lining of the pandemic, experts say, might be the increase in attention on youth mental health it prompted. Teens have pushed districts to create more mental health support in their high schools. Several states are debating giving students mental health days off from school.

Utah went a step further, passing a law this year to require elementary schools to offer suicide prevention programs. At hearings for the bill, advocates said this would help give elementary students the language to ask for help, pointing out that sometimes young children will say “I have a tummy ache” when it’s actually the physical manifestation of stress.

National efforts to help young children include Lifelines, a crisis intervention training for K-12 students and faculty. Three years ago, Lifelines created a program designed for fifth and sixth graders in response to growing demand from school districts.

“We heard it all over — it wasn’t just in one state, it was multiple states,” said Maureen Underwood, a social worker and psychotherapist who co-developed Lifelines. “We often had elementary school teachers come to our trainings for middle school staff.”

Lifelines’ programming for younger children is designed to teach problem-solving skills for stressful situations, types of secrets kids shouldn’t keep and how to ask for help from a trusted adult. The staff training aims to dispel myths about suicide, including the fear that raising the topic with children is risky. Research has shown that asking someone whether they have contemplated suicide does not increase the chance that they will act on those thoughts. This holds true for children, too.

“For those who have recently had thoughts of suicide, asking the question seems to reduce distress,” said Singer, the American Association of Suicidology president.

I don’t think students have nearly enough access to school counselors who can teach those baseline skills of coping and being able to express yourself. Olivia Carter, elementary school counselor in Cape Girardeau, Missouri

Singer wants the CDC to ask younger children about suicide and self-harm in its Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which currently only polls high schoolers about suicidal thoughts, though some states include middle schoolers as well. He also believes schools could play a role in screening children’s mental health, and pediatricians’ offices could offer more information on warning signs.

Carter, the Missouri elementary school counselor, teaches her students coping skills, such as taking deep breaths while counting or stepping away from a stressful situation for a drink of water. She hopes children will come to her, or to another adult, before they consider suicide.

But with so many students, it can feel overwhelming. She is the only school counselor for her 380 elementary students, which, as is the case in many schools across the country, is above the recommended ratio of 250:1.

“I don’t think students have nearly enough access to school counselors who can teach those baseline skills of coping and being able to express yourself,” she said. “The scope of what we’re working on is huge.”

265,"'Matt Gaetz needs to resign,' says GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger","Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois called for fellow Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida to resign on Thursday amid a federal probe into allegations that Gaetz was involved in sex trafficking.

Gaetz, who has not been charged with any crime, has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. He is also scheduled Friday to headline a dinner for Women for America First, a pro-Trump group, at the Trump National Doral in Florida.

""Matt Gaetz needs to resign,"" Kinzinger wrote in a tweet linking to a Daily Beast story about Gaetz, who's become enmeshed in an investigation into former Seminole County Tax Collector Joel Greenberg.

Greenberg has been hit with 33 charges in federal court in Florida, including stalking, wire fraud and sex trafficking of a minor. In a brief hearing in his case in Orlando on Thursday, Greenberg’s lawyer, Fritz Scheller, and federal prosecutors told the judge they expect him to strike a plea deal.

The parties did not signal if Greenberg was expected to cooperate in the investigation into Gaetz. “I’m sure Matt Gaetz isn’t feeling very comfortable today,"" Scheller said outside the courthouse after the hearing.

Federal investigators are looking into whether Gaetz paid women to travel to the Bahamas for sex, NBC News reported Wednesday night. In a statement to CBS responding to reports about the Bahamas investigation, a spokesperson for Gaetz denied that he had ever paid for sex and called it ""a general fishing exercise about vacations and consensual relationships with adults.""

Investigators are also looking into whether Gaetz and Greenberg used the internet to search for women they could pay for sex. The New York Times has reported that he's being investigated for allegedly trafficking a 17-year-old.

A spokeswoman working for Gaetz outside his congressional office, Erin Elmore of the Logan Circle Group, said Friday that he has hired attorneys to push back against the swirl of allegations.

""Matt has always been a fighter. A fighter for his constituents, a fighter for the country, and a fighter for the Constitution. He's going to fight back against the unfounded allegations against him. His legal team, led by Marc Mukasey and Isabelle Kirshner, will take the fight to those trying to smear his name with falsehoods,"" Elmore said.

Gaetz is a close ally of former President Donald Trump and Mukasey, a former federal prosecutor, has represented members of the Trump family and is defending the former president in investigations by the New York Attorney General and Manhattan District Attorney's offices.

Kirshner's previous clients include former New York A.G. Eric Schneiderman, who resigned after being accused of physically abusing four women. He was not charged criminally because of statute of limitations issues.

In an op-ed in The Washington Examiner on Monday, Gaetz wrote: ""Since I'm taking my turn under the gun, let me address the allegations against me directly. First, I have never, ever paid for sex. And second, I, as an adult man, have not slept with a 17-year-old.""

Gaetz has vowed not to resign, and said the ""bizarre claims"" against him were retaliation for challenging ""the most powerful institutions in the Beltway.""

The women's group that the embattled lawmaker will address Friday night tweeted this week that Gaetz ""has been a fearless leader in DC. Few members of Congress have been more willing than Matt to stand up & fight on behalf of President Trump & his America First Agenda.""

Kinzinger, who was one of nine Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and has butted heads with Gaetz before, said the Women for America First tweet shows ""Our politics are broken.""",0
266,"Blood clots 'very rare' side effect of AstraZeneca vaccine, European regulator says","Unusual blood clots should be listed as ""very rare"" side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, Europe’s main drug regulator said Wednesday.

Emer Cooke, the executive director of the European Medicines Agency, said that the ""benefits of the AstraZeneca overall outweigh the risks of side effects.""

The vaccine has ""proved to be highly effective,"" she said at a news briefing, adding that it prevented ""severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives.""

However, Cooke added that after a ""very in-depth analysis,"" the regulator had ""concluded that the reported cases of unusual blood clotting following vaccination with the AstraZeneca vaccine should be listed as possible side effects of the vaccine.""

Because of a very small number of blood clots in younger people reported in the U.K., the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, Britain's vaccines advisory body, said Wednesday that it was recommending that those under the age of 30 should be offered an alternative Covid-19 vaccine to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, where one is available.

More than 20 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered in the U.K. so far, according to the separate Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

In a separate statement, the EMA said that blood clots should be ""listed as very rare side effects of Vaxzevria,"" the official name of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

""So far, most of the cases reported have occurred in women under 60 years of age within two weeks of vaccination,"" the statement added. ""Based on the currently available evidence, specific risk factors have not been confirmed.""

The announcement comes less than a month after the EMA said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was ""safe and effective"" to use. That statement was prompted after a number of countries, including Germany, France and Italy, suspended the AstraZeneca vaccine over concerns about blood clots in some recipients.

Most European countries that had put the vaccine on hold resumed administering it after European regulators said it was safe. Danish officials, however, said last month that they would prolong their suspension of the vaccine while they continue evaluating a potential link with blood clots, according to The Associated Press.

In Britain, which has given out more doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine than any other country, the medicines regulator also reported Wednesday that 79 people in the U.K. had suffered from rare blot clots after being vaccinated and 19 of those died.

June Raine, the MHRA's chief executive, said the agency's review had concluded that more work is needed to establish beyond all doubt that the vaccine has caused the side effects.

In any case, the rare suspected side effects have occurred in an “extremely” small number of people, she added.

Raine said based on the current evidence the benefits of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine against the disease and its associated risks hospitalization and death, continues to outweigh the risks for the vast majority of cases.

She said the risk of this type of rare blood clot is about 4 people in a million who receive the vaccine.

Meanwhile, Dr. Sabine Straus, the chair of the EMA's Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, said at Wednesday's briefing that the currently available data ""did not allow us to identify a definite cause for these complications.""

Download the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

She added that ""no specific risk factors could be identified based on the current data"" and therefore the committee ""cannot recommend any specific measures to reduce the risk.""

""Most of the cases occurred in individuals below 60 years of age and in women,"" she said. ""But because of the different ways the vaccine is being used in different countries, the committee did not conclude that age and gender were factors.""

More research would be conducted, she said.

Cooke added the available data did not allow the EMA to draw any causal link with age groups, or whether male or female. ""There is a lot more use in younger age groups in the U.K. than there is in the E.U. at the moment, and we will take this into account in our further evaluations,"" she said.

Also on Wednesday, South Korea said it will temporarily suspend providing AstraZeneca's vaccine to people under 60 amid the European review. It also approved the Johnson & Johnson shot in a bid to speed up its inoculation rollout.",0
267,"U.K. coronavirus variant is now the dominant strain in the U.S., CDC says","The U.K. variant of the coronavirus is now the most dominant strain circulating in the United States, health officials said Wednesday.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a news briefing that the prevalence of ""variants of concern"" is increasing and that the U.K. variant, known as B.1.1.7, has taken hold across the country.

""Based on our most recent estimates from CDC surveillance, the B.1.1.7 variant is now the most common lineage circulating in the United States,"" Walensky said.

The spread of the U.K. variant, which scientists have found to be more contagious, adds to growing concerns that the country may be on the cusp of another surge. Both case numbers and hospitalizations are increasing, even as the U.S. is vaccinating an average of nearly 3 million people each day.

Walensky reported that some of the recent clusters of cases have been linked to day care centers and youth sports, adding that the uptick in infections seem to be driven by young people.

""Hospitals are seeing more and more younger adults — those in their 30s and 40s — admitted with severe disease,"" she said.

The most recent seven-day average for hospital admissions in the U.S., at roughly 5,000 per day, has increased 2.7 percent over the previous week, Walensky said. New reported infections are similarly increasing, with the most recent seven-day average coming in at more than 63,000 new Covid-19 cases per day, an increase of 2.3 percent from the previous week.

Deaths, on the other hand, decreased by nearly 20 percent over the previous week, likely a result of vaccination of older populations, Walensky said.

In a report published in January, the CDC predicted that the U.K. variant could become dominant in the U.S. by March. At the time, only 76 cases of the B.1.1.7 variant had been identified in 10 states, but the agency projected ""rapid growth"" in the months ahead.

It's not unusual for a virus to mutate and evolve over time, and it's not the first time a variant of the coronavirus has overtaken other strains during this pandemic. A mutation known as D614G, which was first identified in China in January 2020, spread rapidly through Europe and New York City before eventually becoming the most common strain circulating around the world.

White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt said Wednesday that the recent upticks in cases and hospitalizations underscore the importance of staying vigilant and getting vaccinated. According to the White House, 108 million people in the U.S. have received at least one shot, and vaccine eligibility is poised to open up to all adult Americans by April 19.

Though more research is needed, studies have suggested that the vaccines currently available offer strong protection against the B.1.1.7 variant. There are concerns, however, that if the virus continues to spread widely, other strains could emerge that are able to escape the protection induced by vaccines.

As such, Slavitt urged Americans to get vaccinated and uphold mitigation efforts such as social distancing and wearing a mask.

""Even as we vaccinate Americans in record numbers, we're still not even halfway there and the progress we've made can be reversed if we let our guard down,"" Slavitt said. ""It's in our power to minimize death, disease and misery. If all of us do our part, we can help save lives in April, May and June.""",0
268,Biden's Covid relief offers Latinos billions. Will they claim it?,"Houston investor and entrepreneur Tom Castro feared some Latino households might miss out on money coming to them in the latest pandemic relief package, so he started by helping the Ramirez family find more than $20,000, to start.

Then he helped the family, who own a restaurant, realize that they could tap a loan of thousands of dollars more for their employee payroll under the Paycheck Protection Program. It's a loan, but it has lenient rules for forgiving the loan. That put the funds available to them at over $100,000.

The news stunned the husband and wife, who have four children under 18 and preferred not to be interviewed. The family and Castro met through his charter school work.

“They were skeptical. They were skeptical,” Castro said of the Ramirezes' reaction when he added it all up for them. “They said, ‘This is a loan, right?’ No, it’s a gift.”

The Ramirez family raised other concerns. They hadn’t filed their 2020 taxes yet. They thought the aid was for people on food stamps or welfare. There was a pride factor and fear that their futures in the country — they're legal residents and hope for citizenship — could be in jeopardy.

Many immigrant families stopped using public benefits or steered clear of them, even if they were eligible for them, fearing that Trump administration policy changes might jeopardize their chances for legal permanent residency or citizenship. And the first aid package left out many immigrants who pay taxes.

“They are immigrants, and the word on the street was immigrants weren’t eligible” for stimulus checks “because Trump said they couldn’t participate,” Castro said.

A majority of American families will get money from the latest relief package, but Castro and others fear that some Latinos won’t seek out all the law offers them for reasons similar to those the Ramirez family raised.

Latinos were disproportionately hit by the pandemic — economically and in deaths and illness.

Hispanics had just regained earnings and wealth at levels they had had before the Great Recession in 2008. Missing out on the aid could slow not only their recovery, but also the economic recovery.

“This could be the biggest single injection of capital into the Latino community — by a factor of 10 — in history,” Castro said. If all Latinos claimed what they are entitled to in the pandemic package and the paycheck loan program, the total could be nearly $60 billion, he said.

At the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce’s legislative summit last week, President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen hailed the potential for Latino families and business owners to help drive the economic recovery because of the share of American workers who are Latino and the number of small businesses Latinos create.

Democrats designed the stimulus payments the way they did not because they thought everyone was missing meals, but to stimulate the economy, Castro said.

Many Latino families don't have the luxury of hanging on to the payments or putting the $1,400 away in savings or 401(k) accounts, Castro said. They will spend every penny because they need to, and “they are going to pay taxes, sales taxes and help create jobs,” he said.

Every member of the Ramirez family is entitled to a $1,400 stimulus check — a total of $8,400 for the six family members. Married couples who file jointly and earn less than $150,000 get $1,400 each, and so do their dependents who are 17 and under.

In addition, three Ramirez children are eligible for another $3,000 — paid in monthly allotments — and their child under 6 is eligible for $3,600. Altogether, that's $21,000 in cash benefits.

The monthly allotments for the children, if that's how they're done, would come through a reworking of the child tax credit.

The White House has estimated that 85 percent of Americans will get some sort of payment.

A tough year

For Claudia Gonzalez, 49, who worked as Castro’s assistant before she left for health reasons, the additional money for her children will be a big help. The family had a tough pandemic year.

They missed the first round of $600 checks because her husband wasn't yet a legal resident, and at the time he didn't have a Social Security number. He is a legal permanent resident now, and she is a citizen, as are her children.

Gonzalez said the couple had to let go of three of the four employees of her husband’s “very small” commercial and residential landscaping business. Some hotel clients whose rooms were vacant failed to pay him for months of work.

When one of their business trucks broke down, they used the truck their son had bought with savings from Christmas and birthday gifts. They tried to get a $25,000 to $30,000 loan through the Payment Protection Program, but they couldn’t get through the red tape.

Last week, Biden extended the deadline to apply for paycheck protection loans to May 31.

Gonzalez said she and her husband will apply again, expecting the worst. She, too, expressed hesitance about taking any money.

“People have painted Latinos as people with their hand out,” she said. “There’s a lot of Latinos that will do everything in their power to not go to the handout.""

The paycheck protection loans can make a difference in rebuilding Latino wealth.

Juan Proaño, founder of Plus Three, a technology company that assists nonprofits, said the company lost more than 30 percent of its revenue in the second quarter of last year because of the pandemic.

He was unable to get a paycheck protection loan through Bank of America, his bank, despite three tries. He eventually got a loan through PayPal’s loan builder program.

'The money is available, but people have got to use it'

And that’s the challenge, ensuring that Latinos are educated about what they are entitled to, despite cultural hesitation and ways they may disqualify themselves, Castro said.

Ramiro Cavazos, president and CEO of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the organization dispensed grant money to the many Hispanic chambers around the country. The grants were then given to Latino-owned businesses. The chamber is also trying to help the businesses get the money available to them in the Paycheck Protection Program.

""We are a community that believes in comebacks,"" Cavazos said. ""It is part of our DNA as a community.""

Castro suggested mobilizing college students, churches, Latino groups and employers with large Latino workforces to ensure that Latinos get the money they are due.

“This is a little like the vaccination program,” Castro said. “The vaccine is available, the money is available, but people have got to use it, or it doesn’t work.”

269,"Young people are driving the latest Covid-19 surge, especially in Michigan","They’re young, they’re restless, and across the United States they’re driving the latest wave of Covid-19 cases.

Fed up with pandemic restrictions and lulled into a false sense of security by the increasing rate of vaccinations, coronavirus wards at local hospitals are increasingly being populated by younger, still-unvaccinated adults who've let their guard down, the nation's top public health experts are warning.

""It is premature to declare a victory,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, said Tuesday at the National Press Club. ""We're seeing more and more young people get into serious trouble, namely severe disease, requiring hospitalization and occasionally even tragic deaths in quite young people.""

Fauci's warning echoed earlier remarks by Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the head of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“We are now entering our fourth week of increased trends in cases,” Walensky said Monday. “The trends and data have been indicating cases are increasing nationally as we are seeing this occur predominantly in younger adults.”

In particular, Walensky said, “many outbreaks in young people are related to youth sports and extracurricular activities” that involve their parents.

Part of the problem is that Americans have become less afraid of catching Covid-19, even though slightly less than a fifth of the country’s population has been fully vaccinated, the latest NBC News figures show.

In a recent Gallup Poll, just 35 percent of Americans responding to a survey done March 15-21 said they were worried about contracting the coronavirus — a 14 percentage point drop from February and well below the 59 percent record that was set in April 2020 in the early months of the pandemic.

While the biggest decline of 21 percent was among people over 65, the group most likely to be vaccinated, there were also big drops in the percentages of people worried about catching the virus in the 18-44 and 44-64 groups, the poll showed.

Meanwhile, Covid-19 outbreaks linked to younger people have shut down day care centers in Nebraska and Wisconsin and caused cases to quadruple in at least one Connecticut town. In states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Maryland, the number of younger people in hospital Covid-19 wards is on the rise.

“What we are seeing is patients in their 20s and 30s and 40s,” Marna Borgstrom, CEO of Yale New Haven Health, recently told NBC News in Connecticut.

In Chicago, the city's public health commissioner, Dr. Allison Arwady, warned that younger adults are pushing the Covid-19 metrics to a level not seen since October.

""Even if there are more cases in young people, we still are seeing that translate into an increase in hospitalizations,"" Arwady said. ""I am concerned, and I hope everybody is concerned when they look at this data.""

But nowhere is the spread of Covid-19 among nongeriatrics more pronounced than in Michigan, which right now leads the nation in hospitalizations among younger, unvaccinated people, according to the latest CDC figures.

Why Michigan? It’s not just because the state is grappling with the spread of highly infectious Covid-19 variants that’s second only to Florida.

“The surge in cases Michigan is experiencing is a combination factors: variants, outbreaks among schools/sporting teams and a high case rate among 10-19 year olds and now increasing rates among all age groups through 59, and Covid-fatigue,” Michigan health department spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin told local media on Monday.

In an interview last week with NBC News, Michigan public health expert Marianne Udow-Phillips said the surge in new Covid-19 cases “is directly related to the return of youth sports.”

“It’s not happening on the field,” said Udow-Phillips, who heads the Center for Health Research Transformation at the University of Michigan. “It’s happening in transit and afterward, when people are getting together and eating and not wearing masks. It’s happening at parties and where people are socializing.”

While Michigan public health experts have been urging Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to keep the mask mandate and other restrictions in place, an advocacy group for student athletes and their parents called “Let Them Play” has sued the director of the state Health and Human Services Department, Elizabeth Hertel, over a new pandemic order that requires rapid testing for Covid-19 for all youth athletes ages of 13 to 19.

“It seems like there are a lot of people in Michigan who just want to fight Whitmer and don’t want to follow the protocols,” Robert Bensley, a professor of public health at Western Michigan University, told The Detroit Free Press. “They think it isn’t real; it’s a hoax. They won’t get vaccinated and they could get Covid, and they might be transmitting a variant that could be deadly.”

Michigan has seen some of the fiercest resistance to pandemic restrictions, and Whitmer, a Democrat, wound up being the target of what authorities have described as a right-wing kidnapping plot.

Nearly 19.5 percent of Michigan residents have been fully vaccinated, according to Becker's Hospital Review.",0
270,One in 4 U.S. adults is now fully vaccinated,"The U.S. reached a milestone in its vaccination efforts on Wednesday, with new data showing that close to 25 percent of adults in the country have been fully vaccinated.

The data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also show that 40 percent of adults and 75 percent of seniors have received at least one dose.

The country’s Covid-19 vaccination efforts began in December after the emergency authorization of a vaccine by the U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and the German firm BioNTech. That effort was greatly accelerated with the addition of the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.

States such as Illinois and California have tied their reopening plans to the success of vaccination efforts, which determine when it’s safe to resume large gatherings.

Certain states, such as New Mexico, South Dakota and Alaska, have surpassed the national average and fully vaccinated more than 30 percent of their adult populations, according to CDC data.

After his election, President Joe Biden pledged that 150 million shots would be given in his first 100 days. In March, he moved that target up to 200 million. Since then, the country has regularly administered 2 million to 3 million shots a day.

The pace of vaccine production also increased after the Biden administration announced an agreement in March that pharmaceutical Merck would assist Johnson & Johnson with its production. The effort hit a hurdle when a manufacturing snafu tainted 15 million doses of the company’s vaccine.

Still, the U.S. is on course to produce hundreds of millions of vaccine doses by summer. Biden announced Tuesday that by April 19 states should make all adults in the U.S. eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine, advancing a previous deadline by two weeks.",0
271,Myanmar envoy who criticized military coup locked out of embassy in U.K.,"LONDON — Beset by mass demonstrations, global condemnation and sanctions since seizing power in February, Myanmar's military has also faced a quieter protest from the country's ambassador to the United Kingdom.

So on Wednesday they locked him out.

Stood curbside, wearing sneakers and waiting by his car in the upmarket Mayfair area of London, Ambassador Kyaw Zwar Minn told reporters he had been locked out of the embassy by his deputy after refusing to obey Myanmar's military junta.

""It's a kind of coup in the middle of London,"" he told Reuters. ""You can see that they occupy my building.""

British police were standing guard outside the southeast Asian country's embassy as a handful of protesters against the coup and the military's deadly crackdown gathered in the street outside.

Kyaw Zwar Minn, who took up the role in the British capital in 2013 and previously served in France, later issued a statement urging the British government not to recognize or work with any replacement connected to the military.

""The ambassador has been recalled by the Myanmar military regime — since then he has stopped following instructions from the Myanmar foreign ministry,"" he said through his spokesman.

""We believe the U.K. government would not back those who are working for the military junta and we also would like to urge the U.K. government to send them back,"" the ambassador said.

Kyaw Zwar Minn broke ranks and called for elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi to be released in a statement on March 8, with the U.K. lauding the ambassador at the time for his ""courage and patriotism.""

In a letter to the British foreign ministry from the Myanmar embassy, seen by Reuters, those in control of the embassy said that Kyaw Zwar Minn was recalled on March 9. Deputy ambassador Chit Win had taken over as charge d'affairs as of April 7, the letter said.

The U.K. said Thursday it would no longer recognize Kyaw Zwar Minn as ambassador, in line with protocol, now that the junta had issued a formal notification to U.K. authorities of his removal.

NBC News has not verified the existence of the letter.

NBC News did not immediately receive a response to requests for comment from Myanmar's London embassy or the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Like the United States, Britain has sanctioned members of Myanmar's military and some of its business interests in wake of the coup.

""We condemn the bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime in London yesterday, and I pay tribute to Kyaw Zwar Minn for his courage,"" Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab tweeted on Thursday. ""The U.K. continues to call for an end to the coup and the appalling violence, and a swift restoration of democracy.""

The military seized power on Feb. 1 from the elected government of Suu Kyi, who is currently in detention facing various charges.

The junta claimed there were irregularities in the voting rolls for last November's election, which Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party won in a landslide.

The country's ambassador to the United Nations was fired in February after he made an emotional speech in New York declaring his loyalty to the ousted civilian government and calling on the world not to let up pressure on the military.

The U.N., which has condemned the coup, said last month that its special envoy would make attempts to visit the country in the coming weeks.

Anti-coup demonstrators have continued to protest in Myanmar despite a deadly crackdown by security forces.

The death toll has rocketed in recent weeks as clashes have intensified, with more than 600 civilians including many children killed since the junta seized power, according to human rights group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.

At least 11 protesters were killed on Thursday, domestic media reported.

In a speech to soldiers carried in state media on Sunday, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing said security forces were ""exercising utmost restraint"" against armed rioters who were causing violence and anarchy.

The junta at the weekend also announced arrest warrants for more than 60 celebrities, social media influencers, models and musicians in Myanmar on charges of incitement.",0
272,Iranian ship near Yemen attacked as nuclear deal talks begin,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — An Iranian cargo ship believed to be a base for the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and anchored for years in the Red Sea off Yemen has been attacked, Tehran acknowledged Wednesday.

Iran's Foreign Ministry confirmed the attack on the MV Saviz, suspected to have been carried out by Israel. The assault came as Iran and world powers sat down in Vienna for the first talks about the U.S. potentially rejoining Tehran's tattered nuclear deal, showing that challenges ahead don't rest merely in those negotiations.

The ship's long presence in the region, repeatedly criticized by Saudi Arabia, has come as the West and United Nations experts say Iran has provided arms and support to Yemen's Houthi rebels amid that country's yearslong war. Iran denies arming the Houthis, though components found in the rebels' weaponry link back to Tehran.

Iran previously described the Saviz as aiding in “anti-piracy” efforts in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb strait, a crucial choke point in international shipping. A statement attributed to Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh described the ship as a commercial vessel.

“Fortunately, no casualties were reported ... and technical investigations are underway,"" Khatibzadeh said. ""Our country will take all necessary measures through international authorities.”

In an earlier state TV statement, an anchor cited a New York Times story, which quoted an anonymous U.S. official telling the newspaper that Israel informed America it carried out an attack Tuesday morning on the vessel. Israeli officials declined to comment about the incident when reached by The Associated Press, as did the Saviz's owner.

However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday brought up Iran in a speech to his Likud party after being asked to form a government following the country's recent election.

""We must not go back to the dangerous nuclear deal with Iran, because a nuclear Iran is an existential threat to the state of Israel and a great threat to the security of the entire world,” Netanyahu said.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the Vienna talks a “success” while speaking to his Cabinet on Wednesday.

“Today, one united statement is being heard that all sides of the nuclear deal have concluded that there is no solution better but the deal,” he said.

Iran's semiofficial Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, blamed the blast on explosives planted on Saviz's hull. It did not blame anyone for the attack and said Iranian officials likely would offer more information in the coming days.

In a statement, the U.S. military’s Central Command only said it was “aware of media reporting of an incident involving the Saviz in the Red Sea.”

“We can confirm that no U.S. forces were involved in the incident,” the command said. “We have no additional information to provide.”

The Saviz, owned by the state-linked Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, came to the Red Sea in late 2016, according to ship-tracking data. In the years since, it has drifted off the Dahlak archipelago, a chain of islands off the coast of the nearby African nation of Eritrea in the Red Sea. It likely received supply replenishments and switched crew via passing Iranian vessels using the waterway.

Briefing materials from the Saudi military earlier obtained by the AP showed men on the vessel dressed in camouflage, military-style fatigues, as well as small boats capable of ferrying cargo to the Yemeni coast. That briefing material also included pictures showing a variety of antennas on the vessel that the Saudi government described as unusual for a commercial cargo ship, suggesting it conducted electronic surveillance. Other images showed the ship had mounts for .50-caliber machine guns.

The Washington Institute for Near-East Policy has called the Saviz an “Iranian mothership” in the region, similarly describing it as an intelligence-gathering base and an armory for the Guard. Policy papers from the institute don't explain how they came to that conclusion, though its analysts routinely have access to Gulf and Israeli military sources.

The Saviz had been under international sanctions until Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran receive economic relief in exchange for limiting its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration later renewed American sanctions on the Saviz as part of its decision to unilaterally withdraw from the accord.

In June 2019, Saudi Arabia flew a critically ill Iranian off the Saviz after Tehran made a request through the United Nations for assistance.

Amid the wider tensions between the U.S. and Iran, a series of mysterious blasts have targeted ships in the region, including some the U.S. Navy blamed on Iran. Among the ships damaged recently was an Israeli-owned car carrier in an attack Netanyahu blamed on Iran. Another was an Iranian cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea.

Iran also has blamed Israel for a recent series of attacks, including a mysterious explosion in July that destroyed an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at its Natanz nuclear facility. Another is the November killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program two decades ago.",0
273,"Covid deaths reach 4,000 a day in Brazil, bringing hospitals to breaking point","Brazil is bearing the brunt of an alarming surge in Covid-19 cases, with fatalities reaching more than 4,000 in a single day on Tuesday and hospitals stretched to breaking point.

As the United States ploughs ahead with vaccinations and public debates continue on reopening the economy with possible 'vaccine passports,' Brazil's plight is a reminder that much of the rest of the world is still in the grip of the pandemic.

""It's a nuclear reactor that has set off a chain reaction and is out of control. It's a biological Fukushima,"" Miguel Nicolelis, a Brazilian doctor and professor at Duke University, told Reuters.

Brazil's overall death toll of 337,000, according to Brazilian Health Ministry data, is surpassed only by the U.S.'s figure of 562,000, according to NBC News' tally.

The country is battling a highly-contagious local variant amid meager social distancing efforts and a national shortage of hospital beds, according to health experts. Many lay blame with right-wing populist President Jair Bolsonaro who has repeatedly denied the benefit of wearing masks and questioned the efficacy of vaccines, contradicting global health advice.

Brazil has also been through four health ministers since the pandemic began, slowing planning efforts, with some Brazilians travelling to countries such as Uruguay to get vaccinated. Authorities in Sao Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, have emptied old graves to make room amid soaring death tolls.

Despite the recent surge, Brazilian officials are insistent the country can soon return to something resembling business as usual.

""We think that probably two, three months from now Brazil could be back to business,"" Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said during an online event on Tuesday. Meanwhile, leading economists urged the government in an open letter to speed up vaccinations and prepare for emergency lockdowns, contradicting Bolsonaro's assertions that such closures could impose too much financial hardship.

The surge in deaths across the globe serve as a grim reminder that despite successful vaccination roll-outs in the U.S., U.K. and other countries, the global pandemic can't be suppressed while the virus still lingers and mutations evolve.

""No single government or multilateral agency can address this threat alone,"" the World Health Organization said in a statement last week. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has been a stark and painful reminder that nobody is safe until everyone is safe.""

Rowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that although vaccines and social restrictions were working, ""we're definitely not on top of this, speaking globally,"" he said.

""The worst thing you can have is substantial numbers of vaccinated people at the same time as substantial numbers of unvaccinated people with a circulating disease,"" he told NBC News. A scenario that increases the chances of transmission and the spread of mutated variants that are ""vaccine-evading,"" he said, while jeopardizing global travel and trade.

Kao said it would require a ""balancing act"" for countries to get moving again. ""It's going to be a game of can you keep it out long enough to develop boosters towards variants,"" he added. ""All it takes is one person to cross a border.""

Elsewhere the pandemic continues to grow.

India reported a record 115,736 new cases on Wednesday, a 13-fold increase in just over two months with pressure growing on the government to expand its vaccination campaign.

As a second wave gathers momentum, the federal government has asked states to decide on local curbs to control the spread of the virus, but has so far refused to impose any national lockdown after the last one in 2020 devastated its economy.

""The pandemic isn't over and there is no scope for complacency,"" Health Minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted, urging people to get ""vaccinated on your turn and follow Covid-appropriate behavior scrupulously!""

Elsewhere in Asia, South Korea on Wednesday reported its highest single-day number of new cases in three months, amid a rise in infections in kindergartens, saunas, bars and churches, mostly in greater Seoul. The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 668 new cases for Tuesday, the highest level since Jan. 8.

While in Japan, where the Olympics are due to begin in just over 100 days, the western region of Osaka on Wednesday canceled scheduled Olympic torch events and declared a state of medical emergency, as cases skyrocketed.

""It is almost certain that this mutant strain is highly contagious with a high transmission speed,"" Osaka governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said in televised remarks. ""The medical system is in a very tight situation.""",0
274,How the U.S. is forging ahead on green housing while the U.K. falls behind,"U.S. President Joe Biden and U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson have both recently voiced their intention to meet ambitious new emissions targets by 2050. But on at least one crucial piece of the emissions problem — housing — they're headed in different directions.

In late March, British authorities stepped back from an expansion of the U.K.’s green housing stock after the cancellation of a much-trumpeted subsidy for homeowners looking to improve their household energy efficiency.

Days later, the Biden administration unveiled a plan to upgrade American infrastructure that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in the American Jobs Plan earmarked for the upgrade and construction of energy-efficient residences that in the medium term could radically reconfigure the cost considerations that currently govern the construction of new homes and energy upgrades to existing homes.

Experts say housing efficiency is a crucial — but achievable — part of reining in emissions to meet the agreed-upon targets.

“In some ways, the U.S. is forging ahead, and on the other hand, we have a lot of catching up to do” compared to other European countries, said Lauren Urbanek, senior energy policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Getting to any of the 2050 carbon goals is going to require addressing buildings on a big scale and especially existing buildings.”

The heating, cooling and lighting of residential buildings currently represents around one-fifth of all U.S. carbon emissions. Biden's plan calls for $213 billion to build, preserve and retrofit more than 2 million “energy-efficient” homes, taken to mean residences that use less energy than they produce and that are sometimes labelled ""net-zero carbon.""

The lack of strong consumer demand in either country for energy-efficient homes remains a challenge, with no obvious price premium attached to homes with lower utility bills, as is the case in many European nations like the Netherlands.

Local authorities in both the U.S. and U.K. also maintain very different standards and requirements when it comes to energy efficiency in the residential sector, which makes it challenging for larger businesses to find nationwide economies of scale, either in new-build projects or retrofit efforts, such as switching out gas boilers for heat pumps, adding solar panels or installing better insulation in older homes.

But rapidly improving technologies like underground heat pumps, which can cool and heat homes at a fraction of the existing cost of a gas-fired furnace, should help, according to Julian Brooks, programs director at the U.K. campaign group Good Homes Alliance. But homeowners must have the money to buy them, and the manpower to install them needs to exist.

Just as solar installation efforts drew on government subsidies to expand, with companies able to scale up their workforce as costs came down, advocates say a similar dynamic is required for home efficiency gains to be significant. The mantra that infrastructure improvement and eco-development go hand in hand with job creation has already been eagerly adopted by the Biden administration, but not by British policymakers.

In the U.K., there’s currently a shortage of around 400,000 workers with the necessary training to refurbish the country’s tens of millions of existing residences so they meet a net-zero carbon standard, according to calculations from Russell Smith, a civil engineer and founder of the nonprofit RetrofitWorks, which aims to create small-business hubs to address this challenge.

“That is clearly a problem,” Smith said. “We're not being incentivized by government to do the things in the right way to minimize the climate change impact from housing.”

But the Biden administration’s planned cash injection into the green-housing sector should change that in the U.S., experts say, by incentivizing American businesses to tackle some of those immediate challenges like a shortage of trained personnel and limited eco-friendly supply chains.

“Government has started to move in the right direction,"" Brooks said, but he added that progress has been far too halting compared to some European countries when it comes to energy efficiency in housing.

British plans to tackle residential emissions, he added, “are probably not as ambitious as they need to be in a climate emergency.”

In the U.K., the current government’s latest hesitation over subsidies for home energy efficiency measures has thrown up a fresh barrier to progress, while in the United States the Trump administration’s almost total abandonment of emission targets — by withdrawing from the Paris Agreement — means a great deal of ground must now be made up.

“The scope and the scale of the problem has only increased,” Urbanek said, speaking of the difficulties that confront policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic. “It does take some level of bravery from politicians.”",0
275,'Milk Tea Alliance' brews democracy online among young activists across Asia,"BEIJING — How do you take your tea?

For many in southeast Asia, the answer is sweet, milky and with a dash of politics.

From Myanmar to Hong Kong, young people hungry for democracy are clashing with increasingly authoritarian regimes and taking their struggles online around a unifying and popular regional drink, milk tea.

Served iced, sweet or with tapioca balls, the beverage has become a symbol for a virtual solidarity movement, said Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law, a supporter of the so-called Milk Tea Alliance.

""One of the characteristics of the Milk Tea Alliance is that we are kind of glued by common values — the values of pursuing democracy, the values of pursuing freedom,"" Law said.

Although it is not a ""concrete network,"" the online campaign has become an amplifier of support, he added, diminishing the distance between people championing democracy across borders.

The hashtag #MilkTeaAlliance was born when an online spat broke out in April 2020 after nationalistic Chinese internet users criticized a popular Thai actor for sharing comments that referred to Hong Kong as an independent country, offending Chinese sentiments. The actor's fans then charged back, loosely coalescing around the hashtag to defend him.

The online movement has since swelled and been co-opted by millions of pro-democracy activists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Myanmar and even India. Many of them have also popularized the ""three-finger salute"" from the movie ""The Hunger Games"" as a symbol in their struggle.

Democracy is having a turbulent time in the region.

In Myanmar, a lethal crackdown is underway amid a military coup as millions continue to protest the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the country's civilian government, who was elected in a landslide in November.

Suu Kyi and other officials remain in detention in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma.

International calls for her release and for democratic norms to be respected have grown louder in recent weeks — more than 550 protesters have been killed, according to human rights groups on the ground. The Biden administration has limited U.S. trade with the country and issued sanctions against people connected to the military.

""I'm scared whenever I go out,"" said Khin, 31, a protester from Yangon, whose surname has been withheld due to the current risks facing protesters. ""We can be arrested at any time, sent to jail any time or we can be killed any day.""

Khin called the military crackdown a ""disaster"" and said young people were being forced to ""fight for the future,"" online and off.

Using Wi-Fi at a friend's home to speak to NBC News, Khin said that internet blackouts were frequent and that they were an attempt to limit communications.

The Milk Tea Alliance gave activists like her ""courage"" and boosted morale, she said.

""Sometimes we get tired, you know, we feel hopeless ... because we are human,"" Khin said. ""But whenever we see that the Milk Tea Alliance is supporting us and trending on Twitter ... that makes us get energy and stand up again.""

The alliance shared concrete tactics, too, she added. Protesters in Myanmar are learning from those in Hong Kong to carry gas masks, medical kits and umbrellas at demonstrations or to write blood group types on their arms in case they are hospitalized.

The common scourge of growing authoritarianism in the region has galvanized solidarity, said Roy Ngerng Yi Ling, 39, a nonprofit worker and political activist in Taipei.

Young, digitally native people are alarmed by the ""threat of democratic recession,"" said Ling, whose family is from Singapore, and China's increasingly assertive behavior is a particular concern.

""The Milk Tea Alliance ... also reflects resistance against a common threat of authoritarian China not being favorable to our cause for greater freedoms,"" Ling said, urging the U.S. and Europe not to take a ""back seat"" in strengthening democracy in Asia.

""There is only a small window of opportunity here to stand up for democracy globally before it closes,"" he added.

Chinese officials have dismissed the alliance in the past.

""People who are pro-Hong Kong independence or pro-Taiwan independence often collude online, this is nothing new. Their conspiracy will never succeed,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters last year.

President Joe Biden has made championing democracy a hallmark of his political agenda, promising to host the world's first global summit on democracy.

With relations between Beijing and Washington increasingly strained, Biden told reporters at the White House last month that he wouldn't let China surpass America as the world's most powerful country. Chinese leader Xi Jinping ""doesn't have a democratic — with a small 'd' — bone in his body,"" Biden said.

Beijing hit back, stating that China follows ""a people-centered philosophy,"" according to Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying.

""China has, after long-term exploration, found a right path to development. We are confident about this path — we will unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics,"" she said.

China's own online army is fighting back — often with real-world consequences.

Many nationalistic internet users spring to defend Beijing against the Milk Tea Alliance, which they see ""as criticizing Chinese Communist Party rule,"" said Hannah Bailey, a researcher of Chinese online censorship at the University of Oxford's Internet Institute.

""There is a general trend in the last decade that the Chinese state has really shifted from basing its legitimacy on its economic performance ... to shifting to a more nationalistic basis for its legitimacy,"" she said.

Virtual pressure by Chinese internet users has led to boycotts of Western fashion brands, such as H&M and Nike, in the last month. Previously, the National Basketball Association and the Disney live-action movie ""Mulan"" have also been targeted by online campaigns.

In some ways, the heated online exchanges are an extension of Beijing's so-called Wolf Warrior style of international diplomacy, Bailey said — in which the country with the world's second-largest economy has positioned itself more assertively on the global stage.

Law, the Hong Kong activist, who fled to Britain last year after Beijing amassed greater political control over his homeland, said that democracy in the region is waning and that ""systematic suppression"" is rife.

But the alliance is not just about curbing China's influence, he added. It is also a broader tool to stave off ""authoritarian governments and brutal regimes.""

""We're all fighting for the same thing,"" he said. ""Democracy, which is a common value, a universal value.""

276,There are now more jobs available than before the pandemic. So why aren't people signing up?,"“That really is the vaccination job boom,” said Julia Pollak, labor economist for ZipRecruiter. “Employers are taking permanent steps now to plan for a permanent reopening.”

As states have lowered vaccination age requirements dramatically in recent weeks to include almost all working-age residents, Americans are venturing out again in greater numbers. They’re getting on planes, going to the gym, going out to eat, and some have started trickling back to offices in specific industry sectors.

From amusement parks to gyms to airlines, employers across industries are holding massive job fairs and calling back furloughed workers.

But the civilian labor force participation rate, the government’s measurement of those who are working or unemployed but actively seeking work, remains dented, having only recovered by about half.

Workers were discouraged after blasting out résumés in January and February.

“After getting rejected from now over 200 jobs I applied to, I can confidently say that getting a masters was the biggest mistake I have ever made,” tweeted Cassidy Kulhanek, an unemployed printmaker and bookmaker living in Chicago. “I did not have the foresight to know that my field, museums and galleries, would get basically eliminated by a global pandemic!”

But those who have already given up, just before the latest hiring boom, may not have got the message yet about how the labor market is heating up.

“When people lose their jobs, they often engage in a flurry of job search activity, they send off 20 applications, and then they sit back and wait to hear back from employers,"" Pollak said. ""So many people are most engaged in their job search early on when it was most discouraging and their prospects were bleakest.""

However, the situation has vastly improved since the beginning of the year, she said.

“Job seeker confidence has gone down between January and March at exactly the moment that their prospects have improved,” Pollak said. “It'll take a while before people really notice the labor market has heated up.”

There are also plenty of good reasons for workers to still hang back, from ongoing concerns about the coronavirus, to managing remote learning or family obligations, to holding out for better opportunities.

Economic impact payments, or stimulus checks, have also played a factor for some who are sitting out the labor market, some employers say.

Factory owners and employers lament that the generosity of unemployment benefits and stimulus payments have some workers avoiding returning to work because they make more money not working.

“I had one guy quit who said I can make more on unemployment. I’ll take the summer off,” said Robert Stevenson, CEO of Eastman Machine Company, a producer of machines that cut specialty fabrics for industry. “I told him I can’t guarantee you’ll have your job back. He said, ‘I’ll take my chances.’”

But there may also be other unstated factors at play, experts say.

“It’s not just labor demand and supply, these are tough working conditions,” said Bhushan Sethi, global people and organization co-leader at PwC consulting agency.

“I can’t underscore enough the real concern of individuals,” he said. “Am I safe? Will I be forced to trade personal safety around the virus and variants for a job?”

The new job listings are in areas that are reopening, like travel, leisure, and hospitality, but also in remote work and tech areas. Demand remains for workers in jobs that got a pandemic boost like construction, delivery, logistics and warehousing, and vaccine administration.

The gap also speaks to “the lack of ability to match up needs and hire thousands of workers” quickly, Sethi said.

Nearly half of job seekers say they would like a remote job, even after the pandemic, according to ZipRecruiter. But questions arise as to whether a laid-off restaurant or retail worker can transition to online customer service, or become a web designer or cybersecurity consultant.

Some will have the technical skills and desire. Others may need to enroll in online courses to “reskill.” That requires knowing what skills are in demand, having the ability to use a computer and internet connection to obtain them, and the funds to go through the course. Some of the burden lies on the worker to make sure they’re relevant and competitive.

Reskilling and retraining is also a key focus for the new administration.

“It’s time to build our economy from the bottom up and from the middle out, not the top down,” President Joe Biden said in remarks when when he introduced the American Jobs Plan on March 31.

The $2 trillion infrastructure proposal includes $100 billion to fund workforce training programs. It would also call for up to an additional 2 million apprenticeship slots. The Department of Labor’s Dislocated Workers Program would also receive $40 billion and $12 billion for women and minorities in workforce development.

""More investment is required to train Americans for good-paying jobs across industries ranging from construction to energy to manufacturing to technology to caregiving,"" according to a White House statement released in February.

Now, companies are trying to coax people off the sidelines by increasing wages, allowing for more remote work, looking at skills and not just experience. That’s a marked contrast to the rehiring after the recession of 2008 when employers could be quite picky and would layer on skill requirements.

The pandemic started with historic layoffs, but American workers may come out of it with more bargaining power than they’ve had in a while.

“Job seekers still have a tremendous amount of leverage,” Pollak said. “They may not know it because of the horrible experience of looking for a job between April 2020 and January 2021 — but February and March are different worlds.""",0
277,"Nannies look back on a tumultuous year, from family moves to remote schooling to lost wages","When offices, schools and day care facilities shut their doors last year in response to Covid-19, some of the people most swiftly and significantly impacted didn’t work in any of those places: nannies. Now, looking back on a tumultuous year, nannies say some things will never be the same — for better or worse.

Indispensable parts of the system for millions of middle- and upper-income families — nannies saw their jobs, economic security and sometimes even their living situations thrown into disarray. Some found themselves on the front lines of the pandemic, battling Covid-19 after contracting it from the families that employed them.

“They got hit very hard, very quickly,” said Elizabeth Malson, executive director of the U.S. Nanny Association. “When things opened back up again, nannies had a very quick rebound, but what changed dramatically was two things — the need for e-learning skills, and there was now more competition, because of all the teachers and day care workers who had lost their jobs.”

More than one in four nannies reported losing a job because of Covid-19. Now, requests for nannies who can also teach have mushroomed.

Nannies were dismissed en masse in the early days of the pandemic, as parents working in offices were sent home and many families were reluctant to allow a non-family member into their home. According to a survey by the International Nanny Association, more than one in four nannies reported losing a job because of Covid-19, and nearly 40 percent said their income had dropped. The tide began to turn later in the spring, when it became apparent that lockdowns and remote schooling would continue for weeks, if not months. Parents who had settled in to work-from-home arrangements increasingly looked for nannies who could help their kids with schoolwork.

The most affluent families asked their nannies to move in with them — even in places like New York City, where square footage is at a premium. “I think we’ve probably seen an increase of about 70 percent in requests for live-in nannies,” said Jo Barrow, CEO of Nannies by Noa. “It’s changed dramatically,” she said, adding that requests for nannies who can also teach have mushroomed. “The expectations have grown… they’re looking for one person that can wear more hats,” Barrow said. The International Nanny Association found that nearly half of its survey respondents had been tasked with virtual learning or homeschooling in 2020.

In particular, nannies with advanced degrees, fluency in multiple languages and the willingness or ability to put their own lives on hold in order to travel with a family are in high demand. “Those candidates are in the most competitive market we’ve ever seen,” said Shenandoah Davis, CEO and co-founder of the placement agency Adventure Nannies. “There has been more than one bidding war we’ve witnessed.” In high-priced cities like New York, the most sought-after nannies can command six-figure salaries, she said.

In New York, nannies with advanced degrees, fluency in multiple languages and willingness to travel can command six-figure salaries.

But the higher pay some nannies have been able to charge masks a bifurcation in the industry. “On the other side of it, there are families posting jobs on Facebook — 60-hr work weeks for $500 a week, which is illegal and significantly below minimum wage,” Davis said. The challenge is that there are so many women in such dire financial straits that, despite the long hours and poor pay, they are willing to take those jobs anyway. “There are a lot of people trying to get nanny jobs who aren't aware of the law and aren't aware of their rights,” she said.

This weighs especially heavily on undocumented immigrants, many of whom lost nannying jobs early in the pandemic and have been facing increasingly desperate financial circumstances. “Because the population of domestic workers who most often are taken advantage of are most often the people who aren't able to work legally… they also are often afraid of speaking up to their employers,” Davis said. “They’re missing out on so many of the basic rights that come from having a job that’s on payroll.”

There also is the ongoing risk of Covid-19 itself. Sara Sims had worked as a nanny in the Chicago suburbs for a decade, yet the 33-year-old found herself without a job in the early days of the pandemic when the parents who had employed her for two years were sent home on reduced pay — a combination Sims said forced them to dismiss her. “It was a difficult conversation to have, but I completely understood,” she said. “There were tears.”

Sims landed a new job later that spring, caring for a four-year-old and an infant who had been in day care. The parents’ unease with their baby’s potential exposure prompted them to seek out a nanny, and Sims said the parents specifically asked that she limit her activities in her off-hours, such as not socializing in groups.

Bob King, attorney and founder of the law firm Legally Nanny, said intrusive questions from prospective employers have become much more common. “There are many more inquiries into nannies’ personal lives,” he said, even though in California, where his practice is based, nannies’ off-hours autonomy is legally protected. “Employers can’t make any employment decisions based on lawful non-work conduct,” he said. “It became sort of legally sticky to inquire as to what people were doing outside of work hours.”

Based on the recent calls they’ve been fielding from parents, agency owners say vaccines are shaping up to be the next dividing line. Nannies who are willing to be vaccinated — and those who have access to the vaccine — are moving to the front of the line. “What we’re seeing a lot of now, since the vaccine has become so much more really available, is families prioritizing candidates who have already been vaccinated or plan on getting vaccinated,” Davis said.

Nannies who are willing to be vaccinated are moving to the front of the line.

As for Sims, she contracted a case of Covid-19 in April that landed her in the hospital. Her recovery was so arduous, she said, that she had to quit her job. “I couldn't really recover all the way and… I didn't want to go back in the home if I wasn't feeling better,” she said. Instead, she supervised and taught her nephews during the months when they had remote schooling.

A perennial challenge for nanny placement agencies and lawyers who work in the domestic and household employment space is the widespread practice of paying nannies under the table. Agency owners and trade group representatives say one pandemic change they expect to continue is that more nannies want to be paid legally.

“A lot of people getting paid under the table became more cognizant of the need to be paid legally and be on the books,” Barrow said. ""That’s the silver lining.”

“There’s a large percentage of nannies who are not paid on the books and those people could not collect unemployment and all of the benefits,” said Laura Schroeder, a nanny in Charleston, S.C., and president of the International Nanny Association. When thousands of parents dismissed their nannies in late February and March last year, Schroeder said, “That really put them in a difficult position.” The association is helping more of these nannies navigate the process of being compensated legally, she added.

Schroeder said being paid above board proved to be a financial lifesaver when she contracted a serious case of Covid-19 over the summer. “I was seriously ill with Covid — I was in the hospital for four days… and then I was on home health care for two weeks after that on oxygen,” she said. Because she was a legal employee, though, she and her employer were eligible for emergency sick leave benefits in the CARES Act. “My employers paid me in full the entire time, but they got that benefit reimbursed to them,” she said.",0
278,"Sean Combs wades into debate on 'systemic racism' at GM, says Black community should 'weaponize' its dollars","Media and fashion mogul Sean Combs entered the debate over General Motors’ ad spending with Black-owned media, threatening on Thursday to “weaponize our dollars” within the African-American community if the automaker doesn’t respond favorably.

In an open letter to corporate America entitled ""If You Love Us, Pay Us,"" Combs hit back at GM for using his media company, Revolt, as an example of a partnership with Black-owned publications.

“While REVOLT does receive advertising revenue from GM, our relationship is not an example of success,” Combs wrote. “Instead, REVOLT, just like other Black-owned media companies, fights for crumbs while GM makes billions of dollars every year from the Black community.""

Combs' letter comes after a group of leading Black media owners recently posted full-page ads in national newspapers accusing GM of “systemic racism,” and demanding that CEO and Chairman Mary Barra “resign” if she didn’t boost ad spending.

GM responded by setting up meetings with an array of Black-owned media executives while also promising to quadruple ad spending.

Diddy, it starts with us.

I was recently approached to host a show for Revolt and it came without pay. We cannot keep knocking white folks for their disrespect towards minority creators while doing the same thing to each other.



I encourage you to be the change we need❤️ https://t.co/Ms1Ekwlg5a — Jessica Fyre 💫 (@TheJessieWoo) April 8, 2021

The exact size of GM’s advertising is a tightly kept secret. Government filings indicate the company spends $3 billion annually on marketing, but that includes auto shows and product debuts.

In an interview with NBC News last month, Byron Allen, owner of the Weather Channel, and one of the signatories of the ads, said Black media leaders want a $200 million annual commitment for Black-owned media, rising 5 percent annually.

Allen estimated GM spends just 0.5 percent of its ad budget with black-owned media. The automaker contends that figure is 2 percent. In its response on April 1, GM said it was prepared to increase spending to 8 percent. While the company It wouldn’t reveal a specific dollar amount, based on figures used in the advertising trade media, that would reach around $180 million.

For his part, Combs seeks substantially more.

“If the Black community represents 15 percent of your revenue, Black-owned media should receive at least 15 percent of the advertising spend,"" he said in his letter. ""Like the rest of Corporate America, General Motors is telling us to sit down, shut up and be happy with what we get.""

While he declined to say what might happen if GM falls short of expectations, Combs suggested that, ""The same way you understand the power of our dollars, we understand our power to take them away from any corporation that doesn’t give us the economic inclusion we deserve. We are prepared to weaponize our dollars.""

Combs found himself enveloped in his own controversy by stepping into the ad debate. Artist Jessica Fyre responded with a tweet accusing Combs of “hypocrisy,” claiming she was recently asked to host a show on the Revolt network “without pay.”

Last year, rapper Mase accused Combs of business practices that ""purposely starved"" artists represented by his label, Bad Boy Records.

""Our own race is enslaving us,"" Mase wrote in an Instagram post. ""If it’s about us owning, it can’t be about us owning each other. No More Hiding Behind “Love”. U CHANGED? GIVE THE ARTIST BACK THEIR $$$. So they can take care of their families.""",0
279,"Loud debates, fun banter: Mideast finds outlet in Clubhouse","They are boisterous, argumentative and at times downright hilarious.

Hundreds of thousands of people in the Arab world are turning to Clubhouse, the fast-growing audio chat app, to mock and vent against longtime rulers, debate sensitive issues from abortion to sexual harassment, or argue where to find the best and cheapest shawarma sandwich during an economic crisis.

The discussions are endless as they are breathless.

More than 970,000 people from the Middle East have downloaded the new platform since it launched outside the U.S. in January. It has offered space for in-person conversations in an age where direct contact is at the mercy of the pandemic and it’s brought together those at home and the many in exile or abroad.

But mostly, it has offered a release for bottled-up frustration in a region where violent conflicts and autocrats have taken hold and where few, if any, avenues for change — or even for speaking out — seem tenable.

“It is an open coffeehouse that pierces through what is forbidden by the political regimes in the region,” said Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese journalist who closely follows social platforms. “Clubhouse has made people go back to debating one another.”

The Middle East accounts for 6.1 percent of the 15.9 million global downloads of Clubhouse, which launched in the United States a year ago. Saudi Arabia ranks no. 7 globally for the invitation-only downloads, with over 660,000, just after Thailand and before Italy, according to San Francisco-based mobile app analytics firm Sensor Tower.

One reason for its popularity seems to be the no-holds-barred atmosphere, fueled by the liveliness of group conversation.

Saudis organized rooms to discuss who could replace their aging king instead of his ambitious son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They argued with Egyptians over what they considered democracy and with Lebanese and Jordanians over their kingdom’s perceived meddling in their affairs.

Other rooms tackle taboo topics ranging from atheism to homosexuality. A Saudi woman discussed whether abortions should be allowed in the kingdom, prompting a heated back and forth.

The platform also became a place to exchange information, challenging the region’s largely state-dominated media.

Minutes after reports of an attempted coup in Jordan last week, Jordanians inside and outside the country congregated in a room to share information on the confusing reports released and controlled by the government. Families of those arrested in the ensuing sweep shared their news. Some users defended King Abdullah while backers of the brother prince accused of the coup vowed to rally behind him.

Previously unimaginable debates took place among parts of society who would otherwise shun or block each other on other social media.

Opponents debated supporters of Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group. Elsewhere, Lebanese railed against private banks they blame for their country’s economic meltdown — with bankers in the room.

In another room, Iraqis — mainly exiles — criticized how their country’s many religious militias impacted their lives. The moderator, a woman from the southern Shiite city of Najaf now living in Europe, told how her conservative family tried to mold her into “being like them” and opposed sending her to universities where men and women mingle. She fended off one man who suggested she was exaggerating, telling him he hadn’t experienced what she did.

The moderator went on and named figures from powerful Shiite militias and religious leaders, saying she’d seen how they flout the rules they set for others. In the free-flowing conversation, militia supporters frequently interrupted, sparking a torrent of expletives from the moderator and others until they were forced to leave.

“They controlled the ground with their muscles,” the moderator said of the militias. “But social media need brains. This (space) is ours.”

Among the hundreds of rooms discussing the war in Syria, some users decided to lighten the mood. Opposition activists organized a spoof interview with someone posing as President Bashar Assad.

It drew laughs but also poignant reminders of how the 10-year conflict devastated the country. “I ran away from you and still you follow me to Clubhouse,” one exiled Syrian told the fake “Assad.”

But concerns are mounting that the open space could quickly come under the same government surveillance or censorship as other social media.

A decade ago, activists in the Arab Spring protests flocked to Twitter and Facebook, which offered a similar free space. Since then, authorities have come to use the sites to target and arrest critics and spread their own propaganda.

Oman has already blocked the Clubhouse app. In Jordan, it is obstructed on certain mobile networks, while in the United Arab Emirates, users have described unexplainable glitches.

Pro-government commentators have railed against Clubhouse in TV shows and newspapers, accusing it of helping terrorists plan attacks, spreading pornography or undermining religious and state figures.

First, Clubhouse drew rights defenders and political activists. Then came the government backers.

“This room has grown because Salman’s people are here to defend him,” shouted a participant in a room featuring opponents of the Saudi crown prince.

A discussion of the release of imprisoned Saudi women’s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul’s devolved into panicked mayhem when a few participants threatened to expose attendees and report them to authorities. The chat soon cut off.

Recordings surfaced online from Clubhouse conversations deemed offensive, such as about homosexuality becoming acceptable, fueling fears that pro-government Saudi users were keeping tabs on critics. One participant asked to leave a chat among Lebanese when it was discovered she was Israeli, in part because some users feared they could be prosecuted under Lebanese laws banning mixing with Israelis.

Some fear security agents are secretly in the rooms.

Most participants in the app, which remains exclusive to iPhone users, use real names and sometimes put detailed bios. But growing numbers use fake names.

Without anonymity, Clubhouse disagreements could turn into violence in real life, said Ali Sibai, a consultant with Beirut-based digital rights group Social Media Exchange, SMEX.

Clubhouse’s “vague” policies also raise concerns, he said. The company says it temporarily stores conversations for investigating abuses. But it doesn’t say for how long or who reviews the Arabic content, raising questions whether unknown third parties may be involved, endangering participants’ security, he said.

Moukalled, editor of Daraj, an independent online media, said it would be no surprise if authorities impose surveillance on Clubhouse.

But, she said, something else would come along.

“So long as people don’t feel they are part of the decision-making process, they will find these platforms.”",0
280,Neurologist Oliver Sacks' legacy and final days explored in 'His Own Life',"When neurologist Oliver Sacks died in 2015, he left behind a legacy of more than a half-century of exploration into the inner workings of the human mind.

Sacks, who was 82 when he died from metastatic cancer, wrote more than a dozen books drawn from his patients’ case histories, including “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” “Musicophilia,” and “The Mind’s Eye.” In 1973’s “Awakenings,” which was turned into a 1990 film with Robin Williams, he recounted using the amino acid L-DOPA to revive patients rendered catatonic for decades by encephalitis lethargica (also known as “sleeping sickness”).

Sacks wrote about people with amnesia, face blindness, Tourette’s syndrome and a host of other neurological conditions. He approached these subjects with equanimity and empathy, seeing their humanity first, not their disease.

But as much as Sacks had a passion for the human experience, he spent much of his life uncomfortable in his own skin: It was only a few months before his death, in his memoir “On the Move,” that he publicly disclosed his homosexuality.

Sacks’ long struggle with his sexuality — as well amphetamine addiction, recognition and love late in his life — is explored in the Ric Burns documentary “Oliver Sacks: His Own Life,” premiering Friday, April 9, at 9 p.m. ET as part of PBS’ American Masters series.

“It is up to me now to choose how to live out the months that remain to me,” he wrote in a moving New York Times op-ed announcing his terminal diagnosis. “I have to live in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can.”

He decided to spend part of that time working on a film about his life.

“It wasn't as if Oliver set out to create a documentary,” said Bill Hayes, Sacks’ partner since 2009. “It was really complete serendipity. He was reading passages from ‘On the Move’ with his friends and family — funny passages, tender passages, poignant passages. He actually really liked to read from his work. One night, not long after the diagnosis, someone said, ‘Oliver, we should videotape you reading from this book. You're such a wonderful reader, and we should get it down for posterity.’ And he liked that idea.”

Sacks’ longtime editor and friend, Kate Edgar, was the one who reached out to Burns. Given Sacks’ diagnosis, everything moved quickly. Within two weeks a film crew arrived at his home on Horatio Street in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood to start shooting.

“They had only five or six days to film, because he was scheduled for a surgery for his cancer the following week,” Hayes recalled.

Sacks didn’t live to see the finished film, but he put his full faith and trust in Burns.

“Honestly, the marathon week of filming in the apartment was exhilarating. He loved it,” Hayes said. “The Oliver you see interviewed across the table from Ric or surrounded by his family and friends — all that sort of exhilaration, the brilliance, the self-deprecating humor, the eccentricities — that was so much what Oliver was like.”

For Burns, best known for the 1999 Emmy-nominated “New York: A Documentary Film,” the project was like nothing he’d worked on. He knew Sacks’ writing but only met him a week before shooting started.

“There was no research, no development period, we didn't raise money for a year and a half. Oliver would've been dead [by then],” he said. “There was a stark reality hanging over the project from the very beginning. … Each decision going forward was made, I don't want to say intuitively, but rapidly.”

In addition to tracking Sacks’ professional rise, “His Own Life” recounts his difficult childhood, including a Dickensian boarding school experience and a beloved brother diagnosed with schizophrenia. It also revisits his forays into bodybuilding, sex and what author Lawrence Weschler called “staggering bouts of pharmacological experimentation.”

But the film is as much about the last eight months of Sacks’ life as it is his entire biography.

“As you work on a project you find out what the film wants to be,” Burns said. “And that's what this film wanted to be — a film about a man’s life as he was dying. … It’s an archeology of Oliver's selfhood there at this critical moment, a minute to midnight.”

Far from chronicling him retreating from life, the documentary shows Sacks as vibrant and occupied up until the end — seeing visitors, working on new articles, even visiting a lemur colony in North Carolina.

“If you want to know how not to go gentle into that good night try just following Oliver Sacks for a while,” Burns said.

An ‘unexpected’ love

Sacks was 75 when he met Hayes, who was 47 and living in San Francisco. He had read Hayes’ book “The Anatomist,” about the classic medical text “Gray’s Anatomy,” and sent a letter telling him how much he enjoyed it. Despite a nearly 30-year age gap, their long-distance correspondence blossomed into a friendship, and then ultimately love. As Sacks reveals in the film, he had been celibate for almost four decades.

“It was as unexpected for me as it was for him,” Hayes said. “I was not moving to New York expecting to fall in love with Oliver Sacks.”

Like most people, Hayes didn’t know initially that Sacks was gay. But as they spent time together, “I began to understand his complex history of dealing with his own sexuality — which was really very different from mine.”

Beyond the obvious age difference, “I had been out since I was, I think, 24, so that was a bridge to cross, too,” Hayes said.

Sacks discussed Hayes in his memoir, but “His Own Life” is a bit of a love letter to their relationship.

“Some of my favorite moments in this film are just reaction shots of Billy smiling at Oliver; he's got a beautiful face,” Burns said. “You can feel their connection ... There was a deep mutual sensitivity. A real delicacy, which was really beautiful.”

They weren’t two schoolboys in the first throes of passion, but “the embers were far from cooling,” Burns said. “You could feel what peas in a pod they were. You could still feel the heat of the original thing that had brought them together.”

It had been a long journey to that point: When Sacks’ came out to his parents as a teen in the early 1950s, his mother called her son “an abomination” and told him she wished he had never been born.

“Her words haunted me for much of my life and played a major part in inhibiting and injecting with guilt what should have been a free and joyous expression of sexuality,” he wrote in “On the Move.”

Even at the end of his life, Sacks found it difficult to fully embrace his identity. Hayes had his own apartment in Sacks’ building, and the idea of the two of them walking through the West Village arm-in-arm “would’ve gripped Oliver with anxiety,” Burns said. In the film, Sacks introduces Hayes to the video crew as “a fellow writer who lives in the building and to whom I dedicated the present book.”

“He had a helpless need to hide in plain sight,” Burns said. “A phantom limb of closetedness. He knows everyone in the room knows he’s gay … and it’s going to be in the film. He was very open, but at the same time there’s some deep reflexive thing that’s too ingrained to fully eradicate.”

Oliver Sacks, 1987. Oliver Sacks Foundation

In part, Burns added, the film is about Sacks' coming to terms with the wounds he carried.

“I think he really regretted the years he spent really struggling with his sexuality, and, as he says in the film, his own internalized homophobia,” Hayes said. “I met Oliver at a time in his life when he was really at peace with himself, but the one thing that he had not really dealt with was romantic love and being in a relationship. It was amazing and delightful to see him explore that as a man in his late 70s and early 80s.”

Sacks delighted in discovering the joys of domestic life, according to Hayes.

“Something as simple as making dinner together, which we did almost every night. We come together at the end of the day and open a bottle of wine and cut up some radishes and carrots and have some almonds. [We’d] start making dinner together and talk and enjoy,” Hayes said. “All of that, he really loved. It was like a part of life that he had not really experienced.”

281,'Queer as Folk' reboot coming to NBC's Peacock network,"The pioneering LGBTQ series “Queer as Folk” is returning to the small screen.

NBCUniversal’s streaming network Peacock announced Thursday that it had ordered a “vibrant reimagining” of the original British series. The reboot, it added, will center on a “diverse group of friends in New Orleans whose lives are transformed in the aftermath of a tragedy.” (Peacock and NBC News share the same parent company, Comcast NBCUniversal.)

The original U.K. series, created by Russell T. Davies, chronicled the lives of three gay friends living in Manchester’s gay village. It ran from 1999 to 2000 and included just 10 episodes. Davies will be an executive producer on the reboot.

An American version premiered on Showtime just a year after the British original’s debut and centered on a group of gay and lesbian friends living in Pittsburgh. That series, which addressed issues such as same-sex marriage and HIV/AIDS, ran for five seasons, ending in 2005.

The reboot was created by Stephen Dunn, who will be a writer and the executive producer of the series, and will direct the pilot. Dunn called it a “surreal honor to adapt the notoriously groundbreaking series.”

“When the show originally aired, the idea of unapologetic queer stories on TV was so provocative that I felt I could only watch ‘Queer as Folk’ in secret,” he said in a statement. “But so much has changed in the last 20 years and how wonderful would it be if the next generation didn’t have to watch ‘Queer as Folk’ alone in their dank basements with the sound muted, but with their family and friends and the volume cranked all the way to the max.”

Lisa Katz, president of scripted content at NBCUniversal Television, said “Queer as Folk” was “more than just a show.”

“It was a groundbreaking and necessary voice for so many people,” she said in a statement. “Stephen's new version for Peacock arrives at yet another pivotal moment in our culture. … The entire team is so excited to be a part of introducing a new generation to this type of authentic and affirming storytelling.""

Fans of the original U.K. series and the first American remake expressed their excitement for the reboot on Twitter and reminisced about watching the earlier shows.

“Peacock! Is remaking!! ""Queer as Folk""!!! Set in New Orleans!!!! I could not dream up a TV show for which I was more squarely the target audience, I am in hysterics,” Matt Brennan, the television editor at The Los Angeles Times, tweeted.

Another Twitter user wrote: ""Not sure if I need another American version of Queer as Folk, but I will always have nostalgic memories of watching that show as a teenager in my parents' basement with the volume turned down low and my finger on the remote to change the channel in an instant.”

The statement released by Peacock on Thursday did not include information about who may star in the upcoming series or when it will debut.

282,"'Schitt's Creek,' Lilly Singh, 'Star Trek: Discovery' among GLAAD Media Award winners","The comedy show ""Schitt's Creek,"" late-night host Lilly Singh, the drama series ""Star Trek: Discovery"" and music artist Sam Smith were among the winners at this year's GLAAD Media Awards ceremony.

The streaming giant Netflix came out on top with three wins: Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of ""The Boys in the Band"" won the award for Outstanding Film-Limited Release; ""Disclosure,"" about Hollywood's depiction of transgender people, won the Outstanding Documentary award; and ""She-Ra & The Princesses of Power"" tied Hulu's ""First Day"" in the Outstanding Kids & Family Programming category.

The LGBTQ advocacy group GLAAD has held the annual event for more than three decades to honor fair, accurate and inclusive representation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people in media.

This year's virtual event, hosted by actor Niecy Nash, was streamed on YouTube on Thursday night. There were nearly 200 nominees across 28 categories, including Outstanding Music Artist, Outstanding Video Game and Outstanding Drama Series.

""Films and TV shows are like empathy machines,"" GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said during the ceremony. ""What people see and hear in the media impacts the decisions we make in schools, offices, living rooms, courtrooms and at the ballot box. It's not about shaming or canceling anyone. It's about using a moment to educate and create accountability.""

In addition to celebrating the winners, the ceremony highlighted pressing issues affecting the LGBTQ community, such as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, HIV awareness and the epidemic of violence against transgender women of color.

""Disclosure"" executive producer Laverne Cox sent a message of hope to the trans community in her acceptance speech.

""We are looking for people to move beyond acceptance to radical acceptance, to radical self-love,"" said Cox, best known for starring in ""Orange Is the New Black."" ""To the trans youth watching right now, we want you to know that you're anointed, that despite all of the attacks that might be happening against you, you are divine. You deserve to be. You are here for a reason. You must survive to fulfill that divine purpose.""

Teen YouTube sensation JoJo Siwa, who made headlines this year after revealing that she is gay, sent a special message to LGBTQ youths before presenting the ""Sesame Street"" puppet Elmo with the award for Outstanding Children's Programming.

""It's kind of major that people my age can look at me and say, 'Hey, I know someone who is LGBTQ, and she's really, really happy,'"" said Siwa, 17. ""Especially LGBTQ kids who don't live in safe or accepting environments. ... I just feel super honored to have a platform to tell everyone, 'Be who you are, love who you love, and do it with pride.'""

In its annual ""Where We Are on TV"" report this year, GLAAD found that LGBTQ visibility has declined by 33 percent on cable, 13 percent on streaming services and a little over 1 percent on network television in the current TV season. The organization attributed the declines to production halts due to the pandemic.

""We're hoping that is just a blip and not the beginning of a trend,"" Ellis said at the time, suggesting that the decrease overall was largely due to fewer shows' being made. ""The content is more important than ever, and it's having a bigger impact than ever. So, for us, we're thrilled that the drop wasn't as big as it could have been. But, if all things are equal, then even if the quantity of programs goes down, the representation shouldn't.""

Even though overall LGBTQ representation was down, the racial diversity of queer characters was up: For the first time in the report's history, there were more LGBTQ people of color than white LGBTQ characters on screen, with people of color making up 53 percent of regular and recurring LGBTQ characters on broadcast series, 52 percent on cable shows and 47 percent on streaming platform originals.

Thursday's GLAAD Media Awards included appearances by Dan Levy, Katy Perry and Wilson Cruz, along with performances by Grammy-nominated rapper Chika, YouTube star Rebecca Black and singer-songwriter Jessica Betts (who married Niecy Nash last year). The cast of ""Glee"" also virtually reunited for a special tribute to the late actor Naya Rivera, who played lesbian cheerleader Santana Lopez on the hit Fox show.

The full list of GLAAD Media Award winners can be found on the organization's website, and the ceremony can be viewed on demand on Hulu through June.

283,Why Hollywood is finally trying to tell slain Black Panther Fred Hampton's story,"Fred Hampton, the charismatic chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, is portrayed in two films gaining traction through Hollywood’s award season.

Played by Kelvin Harrison Jr., Hampton briefly appears in “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” a dramatization of the 1969 trial against a group of antiwar and countercultural activists accused of a conspiracy to incite a riot at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.

In “Judas and the Black Messiah,” Daniel Kaluuya stars as Hampton, who is being monitored by FBI informant William O’Neal, played by LaKeith Stanfield. As he infiltrates the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers, O’Neal grows closer to Hampton and eventually provides information leading to the Dec. 4, 1969, predawn raid where Hampton was killed by Chicago police officers. He was 21.

Of the two films, “Judas” presents a more detailed image of Hampton and the charisma and intellect that marked his time as a leader in the Illinois Panthers. But some scholars of Hampton and the Black Panthers at large argue that the film only glosses over his political outlook and the Panthers’ impact on social and economic justice.

“It's great that Hollywood is giving credence to the martyrs and icons of the movement,” says Jakobi Williams, an associate professor of history at Indiana University-Bloomington. “The downside of it is that some of this is hyperbole, incorrect and misleading.”

Williams, the author of “From the Bullet to the Ballot: The Illinois Chapter of the Black Panther Party and Racial Coalition Politics in Chicago,” said he does not endorse or promote the film, emphasizing that it “is not a biopic of Fred Hampton.”

Still, the movie has garnered critical and popular acclaim, highlighting that there is a new desire and appetite for better understanding about the Panthers and Hampton himself.

Hampton was an established activist before the Black Panthers

Frederick Allen Hampton was born in 1948, as the youngest of three children to Francis and Iberia Hampton. The family settled in Maywood, Illinois, a middle-class suburb of Chicago, during Hampton’s youth.

Hampton’s activist work began early. As a high school student, Hampton organized student campaigns for more Black teachers and administrators, pressed the school to select its first Black homecoming queen, and led protests at the Maywood police station.

In 1966, Hampton, by then a junior college student, was recruited to join the West Suburban NAACP chapter and eventually led the branch’s Youth Council.

By 1968, however, Hampton had grown frustrated with both the NAACP and the civil rights movement at large. After meeting a member of the Black Panther Party during the organization’s tour stop in Chicago, he absorbed the organization's calls for class solidarity and armed self-defense.

In footage used in the 1971 documentary, “The Murder of Fred Hampton,” the young activist discusses what pushed him to join the movement. “I was born in a bourgeois community and had some of the better things in life,” he says. “But I found that there were more people starving than there were people eating, more people that didn’t have clothes than did have clothes, and I just happened to be one of the few. So I decided that I wouldn’t stop doing what I’m doing until all those people are free.”

Hampton became a founding member and spokesman of the Illinois chapter of the Black Panther Party in 1968. He gained notoriety among young Black Chicagoans with his magnetic personality and searing rhetoric on topics from local police violence, community control of programs, and his opposition to the Vietnam War.

But Hampton’s most repeated argument was focused on class solidarity. A self-identified Marxist-Leninist, he argued that communities needed to unite together to fight capitalism and continue efforts like the Poor People’s Campaign led by Martin Luther King Jr.

“We're going to fight racism with solidarity,” Hampton said in a 1969 speech. “We say you don't fight capitalism with no Black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.”

Hampton and the Illinois Panthers pushed for class solidarity

While the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was founded by Bobby Seale and Huey Newton in California in 1966 with a focus on ending police brutality and the importance of armed self-defense, the organization also strongly supported providing resources to poor communities. The Panther’s “survival programs'' included free breakfast programs for children, medical clinics and food pantries, each serving as a criticism of the federal government’s failure to provide for its citizens.

Hampton saw the programs as a crucial part of the larger push for community empowerment and self-determination, saying in an undated speech that “first you have free breakfasts, then you have free medical care, then you have free bus rides, and soon you have freedom!”

The Illinois Panthers also made sure to highlight that their movement for Black self-determination and community control would not come at the expense of other communities. Chicago had historically been (and still is) one of the most residentially segregated cities in America. The Panthers argued that the poverty, discrimination and police harassment Black Chicagoans faced was also being experienced by other marginalized communities in the city. As such, the best way to fight these issues would be for poor communities across the city to come together to advocate as a united group.

Through the work of Bob Lee, a member of the Panthers, and Hampton’s powerful oratory, the Panthers established the Rainbow Coalition, a multiracial alliance led by the Black Panther Party that included Puerto Rican activists, white former Southerners and other radical organizations from around Chicago. Hampton saw the alliance as “a political coalition that respected ethnic communities of all kinds led by poor, Black youth.” The coalition quickly went to work as groups like the Young Lords, a Puerto Rican gang turned civil rights group, and the Young Patriots, a group of poor former white Southerners, organized around the needs of their respective communities and adapted the Panthers’ survival programs for their neighborhoods.

The coalition frequently denounced the administration of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley, a Democrat who ran a powerful political machine. The local Panthers criticized Daley for encouraging police harassment in poor neighborhoods, for stifling the political chances of independent Black politicians unaffiliated with his group, and for pursuing an aggressive urban renewal campaign that pushed poor people into increasingly desolate conditions.

Hampton’s killing in 1969 sparked outrage — and a yearslong legal fight

The Rainbow Coalition raised Hampton’s profile in Chicago, and his growing influence within the Black Panther Party made him a target of federal surveillance. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover declared the group the “greatest threat to internal security” of the United States. Hampton was one of many Black activists watched by the FBI’s COINTELPRO, a covert counterintelligence operation of the 1950s and ʼ60s.

The FBI kept a close eye on Panther activities, with the help of informants and infiltrators. One such infiltrator was William O’Neal, the main subject of “Judas and the Black Messiah,” who joined the Illinois Panthers chapter and closely monitored Hampton.

The FBI worked closely with police in Chicago and passed along information requested by the Daley administration, which pressured federal officials for information. “The local government is way more sinister than the FBI,” Williams says of the law enforcement efforts to monitor and subvert the Illinois Panthers.

The relationship between local police and the FBI led to the 1969 raid at a Chicago apartment used as a hangout by many of the Illinois Panthers. In the early morning, a group of 14 Chicago police officers knocked on the door and then opened fire, fatally striking Panther Mark Clark. Officers continued to fire as they entered the residence, shooting more than 90 rounds and wounding several Panthers inside. Hampton had been sleeping in a back bedroom at the time of the raid.

The officers argued that they shot him in self-defense, but witnesses said that Hampton remained asleep and that an officer shot him point-blank in the head. The Cook County state’s attorney at the time, Edward Hanrahan, argued that the Panthers had fired first and that the officers had responded to protect themselves. He initially tried to charge all of the survivors of the raid with attempted murder.

But that claim was quickly refuted after Panthers gave reporters access to the apartment after the raid, revealing that virtually all of the shots had been fired into the apartment by police. A federal grand jury found that the raid was “ill-conceived,” but ultimately declined to indict the officers.

The surviving Panthers described “nothing short of deliberate murder” in the hours after the raid, Jeffrey Haas, Hampton’s lawyer, wrote in “The Assassination of Fred Hampton: How the FBI and the Chicago Police Murdered a Black Panther.”

“The raid looked like an assassination,” Haas wrote.

Haas helped represent Hampton’s and Clark’s families, as well as the survivors of the raid, in a 1970 civil lawsuit that named city and federal officials as part of a conspiracy to conduct the raid. The legal battle revealed several details about COINTELPRO’s focus on the Panthers. The case was settled in 1982 for $1.85 million.

Decades after his killing, Hampton’s legacy endures

While Hampton’s story has long been a significant part of the history of the Black Power movement, his life as an influential activist and organizer has not been readily documented or highlighted in popular media until now. Part of this is due to a longstanding narrative surrounding the Panthers that frames them as an exclusively violent, anti-white organization, a characterization that ignores the ways that they were heavily active in helping Black communities and encouraged relationships with other marginalized people.

For some observers, “Judas and the Black Messiah,” a Hollywood production that has already won major awards for actors like Kaluuya this season (Golden Globe for best supporting actor) as well as six Oscar nominations, including best picture, goes a long way toward helping to counter this narrative by providing a closer look at the Panthers and the ways that they were targeted by the federal government.

""The movie isn't a rah-rah pro-Panther narrative or an anti-Panther narrative. It's very much steeped in historical understanding,"" David F. Walker, who wrote a graphic novel about the Black Panther Party, told NBC News in February.

But for scholars of Hampton’s history and politics, the film, while a great display of his charisma and dynamic nature, falls short in actually telling his story or that of the Illinois Panthers.

Williams, the history professor, is working on a book about the Rainbow Coalition and is helping to develop a school curriculum in Chicago schools about Hampton and the Panthers. He said the film fails to truly engage with parts of the Panthers’ work, like the transformative nature of the Rainbow Coalition or its free survival programs. He added that the movie doesn’t acknowledge the role that women played in the Illinois chapter, in particular, and is overly sympathetic in its depiction of O’Neal.

“If you watch the movie, it’s all about guns and violence and shootouts,” he says. “It reinforces stereotypes.”

But the renewed attention to Hampton could help bring further awareness of the longstanding influence of the Panthers’ work on things like free school breakfast and lunch programs, and on the ways that its idea for the Rainbow Coalition would transform political organizing and help lead not only to the election of Chicago’s first Black mayor, Harold Washington, in 1983, but also become an aspect of the political playbook that helped drive the election of the nation’s first Black president, Barack Obama, in 2008.

And as the nation grapples with the same issues of racial injustice and police violence that Hampton spoke out against more than 50 years ago, his words are affecting a new generation of community activists and organizers.

Ultimately, Williams said, he hopes that more people are inspired to learn about Hampton and the Panthers. “Fred Hampton is the most important political figure in the 20th century that most people have never heard of,” he said.

284,Students lead US push for fuller Black history education,"TRENTON, N.J. — Ebele Azikiwe was in the sixth grade last year when February came and it was time to learn about Black history again. She was, by then, familiar with the curriculum: Rosa Parks, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and a discussion on slavery. Just like the year before, she said, and the year before that.

Then came George Floyd’s death in May, and she wrote to the administration at her school in Cherry Hill, in New Jersey’s Philadelphia suburbs, to ask for more than the same lessons.

“We learned about slavery, but did we go into the roots of slavery?” Ebele, 12, said in an interview. “You learned about how they had to sail across, but did you learn about how they felt being tied down on those boats?”

Her letter went from the principal to the superintendent and then began to make headlines, leading to pledges to include fuller Black history courses.

In the months since Floyd’s killing in Minneapolis, educators say they’ve heard a demand from students for fuller Black history lessons beyond what was already offered. Lawmakers and states have passed or begun implementing legislation calling for more inclusive instruction.

The previous generation of courses focused on cultural awareness. What schools found, according to Maurice Hall — the dean of the College of New Jersey’s arts and communications school and a social justice scholar — was that students still had socioeconomic, cultural and racial blind spots.

Growing up with a majority point of view could mean thinking that the way a particular culture sees the world “is in fact the right way,” Hall said.

Connecticut implemented a law in December requiring high schools to offer courses on Black and Latino studies. New Jersey, where learning standards already included some diversity education lessons, last month became the latest state to enact a law requiring school districts to incorporate instruction on diversity and inclusion.

A handful of other states have pending legislation that would make similar changes, including Washington and Virginia, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The pandemic is partly credited with the response to Floyd’s death while pinned by a white police officer, a confrontation that was caught on video and beamed into homes where people were isolating. The effect spilled over into schools, said Michael Conner, the superintendent in Middletown, Connecticut. Students held rallies and helped put race at the top of educators’ consciousness.

African American and other non-European history tends to focus on how those societies were marginalized, while Europeans get portrayed as culturally competent, Conner said, something he calls a “deficit” context, as opposed to an “asset” context.

Like 12-year-old Ebele, he pointed to learning about the same handful of prominent African-American figures.

“When I look at my education, the only time I learned about Black history in school was during the month of February,” he said. “I learned about my culture at the dining room table with my mother and grandmother.”

Districts adding diversity to their curricula now have to determine how to do it and what that looks like.

In New Jersey, the education department is required to come up with sample activities and resources for districts. And some schools there and elsewhere are adding books to the curriculum or examining them in new ways.

In Middletown, Dan Raucci, an English supervisor, pointed out how “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee has long been a 10th-grade staple. Students and teachers are discussing whether Atticus Finch, the white attorney who defends a Black man accused of raping a white woman, is a “hero of today, or of that time period?”

But the district has added new books, like Jason Reynolds’ ”The Boy in the Black Suit,” a novel that follows a Black teenager as he deals with grief.

The changes actually came before the Connecticut law’s 2020 implementation, but last year’s events underscored the imperative to revise the curriculum.

New Jersey’s legislation calls for creating a welcoming environment “regardless of race or ethnicity, sexual and gender identities, mental and physical disabilities, and religious beliefs.” It also seeks to examine unconscious bias, or implicit prejudice.

That raised concerns among some right-leaning groups that the government was forcing students to adopt beliefs. Among those testifying against the bill was the conservative Family Policy Alliance of New Jersey.

“Students should learn to be respectful of others’ beliefs and backgrounds based upon their unique experiences and cultures,” said Shawn Hyland, advocacy director, said in a statement last year. “However, ‘diversity’ trainings in public schools are the very opposite of respect.”

That criticism suggests conservative states — unlike liberal New Jersey and other states passing laws on curriculum diversity — may balk at such curricula. Already in Iowa, lawmakers have passed a bill to ban school diversity training, and in Idaho, lawmakers voted to kill a higher education budget over diversity programs in universities.

But in New Jersey, Ebele’s mother, Rume Joy Azikiwe-Oyeyemi, 38, was surprised her daughter’s efforts were met with such support. She said she had no idea that so much headway could be made in such a short time.

“As her mom I am beyond proud,” she said. “What’s next?”

285,"Seattle woman charged with hate crime, accused of threatening Vietnamese American neighbor","SEATTLE — A suburban Seattle woman accused of threatening her Vietnamese American neighbor has been arrested and charged with a hate crime, prosecutors said.

The neighbor of Jan Myers in Shoreline said Myers had acted erratically and yelled racial slurs at her for years, The Seattle Times reported.

On April 5, “these anti-Asian racial slurs escalated to threatening behavior,” prosecutors said.

Myers that day referred to the neighbor as “slant eye,” and yelled “Hey Miss Vietnam … You’re not going to live very long,” according to the charges.

Police said the neighbor recorded video that documented the confrontation.

Myers had complained previously that the neighbors’ cat had defecated on her lawn, police said. In an interview with deputies, she denied making threats or calling the neighbor “Miss Vietnam.” Police said the statements “were inconsistent with what the video showed.”

Myers was released on her own recognizance after an initial court hearing. She is scheduled to attend an arraignment April 22.

Court records do not show which attorney is representing Myers. Myers’ race wasn’t immediately known.

The allegations are the latest in a national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes.

This was the 11th hate-crime case filed by King County prosecutors this year, with four involving victims identified as Asian American and/or Pacific Islanders, prosecutors said.

286,Olympic athlete Sakura Kokumai targeted in anti-Asian rant at park,"Sakura Kokumai, an Asian American karate athlete who will compete in the Tokyo Olympics, said she was at a park in Orange County, California, when a man began yelling at her and using racial slurs.

Kokumai, 28, captured part of the incident on her cellphone and shared the video on her Instagram page. She said she usually likes to keep her social media positive but felt it was important to share what happened ""so we can protect each other.""

In the video, a man yells at Kokumai and calls her a loser. ""Go home. Stupid b----,"" he says.

He then threatens her, saying, ""I'll f--- you up.""

The karate star told KTLA that she was at Grijalva Park to train for the Olympics when the man started to verbally harass her. She said as he got in his car to leave, he used racial slurs.

“I was aware about the anti-Asian hate that was going on. You see it almost every day on the news,” she told the outlet. “But I didn’t think it would happen to me at a park I usually go to to train. “

Kokumai wrote on Instagram that other people were at the park and witnessed the attack, but did not intervene.

""Yes what happened was horrible, but I don’t know which was worse, a stranger yelling and threatening to hurt me for no reason or people around me who witnessed everything and not doing a thing,"" she wrote.

As things escalated toward the end, a woman came up to Kokumai to ask if she was OK ""but for the longest time no one cared,"" she said in her post.

""People would walk by, some even smiled. And I didn’t know what to do,"" she said. ""This could have happened to anyone, if it wasn’t me, someone could’ve gotten hurt.""

Kokumai ended her Instagram post by encouraging people to have respect for one another.

The incident is the latest in a string of anti-Asian attacks reported across the country. A recent analysis of police department statistics showed that there was a significant hike last year in crimes against the Asian community across major U.S. cities, driven in large part by the Covid-19 pandemic.

The analysis was released last month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. It examined hate crimes in 16 of the country's largest cities and revealed that while such crimes in 2020 decreased overall by 7 percent, those targeting Asian people increased by nearly 150 percent.",0
287,How a new take on teenage rebellion caught Mindy Kaling's interest,"When Sanjena Sathian’s agent first suggested that they send an advance copy of her debut novel to Mindy Kaling and her production company, Sathian was all for it — but she was skeptical that anything would come of it.

She was thrilled when she received a positive response. “It seemed like they had really engaged with it and understood that it was both comedy and drama,” Sathian said in an interview.

Sathian’s debut novel, “Gold Diggers,” which takes its title from the hit 2005 song by Kanye West, is set in an Atlanta suburb during the George W. Bush administration. It focuses on Neil Narayan, a directionless Indian American teen who struggles with the expectations placed on him. Everything changes when he is drawn into a scheme led by his longtime crush, Anita Dayal, and her mother. For years, the Dayals had been stealing gold jewelry from members of their tight-knit Indian community to create an ancient potion that, when consumed, allowed them to steal the talent of the gold’s previous owners.

Kaling saw a story that she could bring to the small screen. In February, her company, Kaling International, announced that it would adapt “Gold Diggers,” which will be released Tuesday by Penguin Press, for television, with Sathian co-writing the script and Kaling serving as executive producer.

Sathian was inspired to create the plot when she heard about a spate of jewelry thefts that targeted Atlanta’s Indian community in 2012. Some speculated at the time that thieves were focusing on Indian Americans because they were known to have elaborate jewelry in their homes. “I remember my mom saying, ‘I know that people outside the community are being blamed, but I promised you, Indians are involved somewhere,’” Sathian said. “I remember just thinking about that for a while and thinking, ‘What would it be like to be an Indian person who was stealing from other Indian people?’”

As a co-writer of the proposed television series, Sathian is eager to contribute to the growing number of portrayals of South Asian American life on American television. She credits Kaling and her work on the hit NBC show “The Office” for showing a generation of South Asians what was possible when it came to storytelling. “I just really admire Mindy's own arc. I’ve admired her since I saw the Diwali episode of ‘The Office,’” she said. “I did not know you can do that as a brown comedian and take up space and be snarky and irreverent in this mainstream sitcom.”

Creating the characters of Neil and Anita, two young people who came of age in Georgia in the early 2000s, also allowed Sathian to examine the South Asian experience in the South. While friends and early readers often note that the aimless Neil seems very different from Sathian herself, she says she feels she has a lot in common with him.

“I looked like a success to the people around me, but I really struggled with about half of school. I was very good at the humanities, but I really flailed my way through math and science,” she said, adding that her struggles with those subjects led to a lot of insecurities and anxiety. “People are reading [Neil] as though he's kind of an aberration or a new picture of the community, but that is just always what it felt like for me.”

“Gold Diggers” is set in the fictional town of Hammond Creek, which was based on the Atlanta suburbs the author grew up in. Now 29, she has had a firsthand look at how Asian Atlanta has evolved over her lifetime. “I went to a majority-white high school, and there was a little bubble of Indians who all stuck together,” she said. “A lot of us were on the debate team, and the debate team’s motto was ‘What can brown do for you?’ It was very tight-knit.”

Sathian said she also tried to draw on the long histories of South Asians in the U.S. throughout the story. As her character Neil grows up, he begins to study the histories of Indian workers during the Gold Rush in the 1800s as a grad student. She began thinking about those histories while she was living in the San Francisco Bay Area as a recent college graduate. “I really had never heard a drop of South Asian American history until I was living in California. I then learned about the Ghadar Party and the history of Sikh Americans in Stockton,” she said. The Ghadar Party was a World War I era movement among Indians in the United States who mobilized to end the British colonization of their homeland. “That just exploded my conception of who we were as a community.”

Sathian said that as she gets ready to introduce her book to the world, she has been struck by the different ways readers have been responding to Neil and Anita.

“All I've ever wanted was to write a novel and exist in the world as a writer,” she said. “I've been lucky enough to be in conversation with other writers who have this really sharp reading of the book. I’ve just been thrilled to see that it connects with other people. That’s one of the coolest gifts I think anyone can have with their writing.”",0
289,"For Latino kids, a new educational show has puppets, Spanish, and a little English too","Where can you find a talking coconut and a pink puppet asking a NASA expert about space — while speaking in Spanish with a sprinkling of English?

“Club Mundo Kids,"" a new educational series aimed at first- and second-generation Latino children, premieres April 10 on Televisa and April 11 on Universo, a channel owned by NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.

Hosted by Romina Puga from her ""clubhouse,"" the show follows ""Romi"" (Puga) and her two neighbors, Coco, a coconut shaped puppet who claims to be the brave one out of the bunch, and Maya, a plush puppet who loves going on adventures.

Romi and her puppet friends explore topics such as space exploration, endangered animals, arts and sports by talking to experts or working on projects, including creating a small house out of recycled items or learning you can't grow a mustache by planting one.

""There really isn't anything like this, especially for this audience,"" Puga, 31, told NBC News. ""We really put a lot of love and thought into all of it. It all comes from a very genuine and authentic place where we just want kids to enjoy this.""

Each episode involves children submitting questions to be answered by experts. The list includes NASA's human space flight mission manager Rosa Ávalos-Warren, a Peruvian American; wildlife expert Ron Magill; conservationist Jack Dalton, who is working to get orangutans off the endangered species list; child activists from Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future; and members of the tree-planting foundation Plant-for-the-Planet.

Puga, a former ABC News correspondent, says being the show's bilingual host is her dream job. She watched similar educational, yet whimsical, shows, such as ""Bill Nye The Science Guy"" and ""The Magic School Bus,"" and would often recreate the things she saw. That's why the crafts on set, ones she mostly makes herself, are supposed to look like ones viewers can create at home.

Reflecting the diversity of the Spanish language

The show is meant for Spanish speakers who are growing up speaking it as their first language, but the program brings in certain English keywords that children might hear in school, like the Endangered Species Act — as well as highlight the different dialects in Spanish to reflect the diversity of U.S. Latinos.

The Miami native host, whose parents are from Chile and Argentina, shares in a nutrition-themed episode that her favorite food is corn, which she calls ""choclo,"" while sharing that others call it ""maíz"" or ""elote.""

""We do a lot of that,"" she said. ""Just opening their minds to, 'Hey, my classmate speaks Spanish but his Spanish doesn't sound like mine. Why is that?' And so we're explaining that but in a fun way, and our hope is to encourage empathy, curiosity and that feeling of identifying with this show, which embraces multicultural identities.""

In 2018, more than 1 in 4 U.S. newborns were Latino. More than 8 in 10 Latino parents say they speak Spanish with their children, according to Pew Research, but the share drops significantly as immigrant connections become more distant — as well as when one parent is not Latino. However, a large majority want their children to know the language.

In 2015, the United States became the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the world after Mexico.

""They don't need to pick one or the other""

Puga recounted how she was raised speaking Spanish at home and learning English in school. She grew up eating the food of her parents' native countries and spent time with family members on the weekends. As other U.S. Latinos have said about growing up between cultures, she didn't quite identify with her schoolmates or with her South American native-born cousin.

As she got older, she met friends in Miami who had mixed identities like her. She said she finally felt like she could identify with this new group that embraced both or, in some cases, three cultures.

""To me, that's what I want 'Club Mundos Kids' to be — that group for kids, a place to identify, where they don't need to pick one or the other,"" she said. ""They don't need to pick English or Spanish but they can celebrate and be proud of their multicultural identities. This whole show was built with them in mind and built for these kids so their stories could be told, and we could celebrate all of those identities that they feel.""

290,An unaccompanied teen reunites with her mother after being hospitalized with Covid,"SAN DIEGO — Cindy, 17, had not seen her mother in a decade. Last month, she took a chance and journeyed from Honduras until she reached the U.S. border from Mexico for a chance to reunite with her mother, who lives in New York.

Cindy, who is being identified only by her first name for safety reasons, spent three days in a hospital bed on the opposite side of the country, in California, as she battled Covid-19. Although she had spent several weeks in U.S. immigration facilities before she fell ill, her mother did not learn about her daughter's hospitalization until Cindy was able to borrow a phone from a doctor at the hospital.

""There are backlogs and delays in communication that are really unacceptable,"" said immigration lawyer Kate Goldfinch, who is helping Cindy's mother, Maria Ana, reunite with her daughter. Goldfinch is board president of the nonprofit Vecina, which helps immigrant parents reunite with their children.

Maria Ana, who is being identified only by her first name as precaution to protect her daughter's identity, said she feared she would never see Cindy again after learning she was hospitalized with Covid-19. Following weeks of anguish and uncertainty, Maria Ana spent most of her nights painting the bedroom she has fixed for Cindy, just ""waiting for my girl,"" she said.

But on Wednesday night, Maria Ana flew to San Diego to reunite with her daughter who had just recovered from Covid-19. During the emotional mother and daughter reunion, Cindy shed tears of relief as Maria Ana hugged her and whispered, ""no one else is going to hurt you.""

Families and immigration advocates are pushing for the government to connect children and teens with their U.S. families in a more timely manner. More than 80 percent of the unaccompanied minors in federal custody have relatives living in the U.S., people the children can be released to, and about 40 percent have parents in the U.S., Goldfinch said.

""So we would think that it would be fairly quick and simple to release a child to their own parent. But because of the chaos of the system, the reunification of these kids with their parents is really frustrating and backlogged,"" Goldfinch said, ""most frustrating, of course, for the actual children and their parents.""

Goldfinch said no one at the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, or anyone with any of the agency's offices had notified her client that Cindy had been taken to the hospital while she was in its custody.

""I don't know why my daughter has to be suffering this way, because it's not fair. It's something very sad for me,"" Maria Ana said in Spanish.

""I've already been through a lot,"" Cindy, who spoke with NBC News with her mother's permission, said. ""But I hope it's all worth it.""

After having crossed the border, Cindy spent several days in a detention facility in Texas in the custody of Customs and Border Protection, or CBP. On any given night, Cindy said, she would share two mattresses with about eight other girls. She could shower only every five days in one of the eight showers the facility had to serve 700 girls.

""It was really bad,"" Cindy said.

In response, CBP said in a statement that ""addressing the flow of unaccompanied children crossing our southwest border is an important priority."" As part of those efforts, the agency continues ""to quickly and efficiently transfer unaccompanied minors after they are apprehended to HHS custody, as is required by U.S. law, and as is clearly in the best interest of the children,"" it said.

The Border Patrol encountered 18,663 unaccompanied children in March, the largest monthly number ever recorded. A complex mix of factors in the U.S. and Central America drove the increase in arrivals to the border, including a series of natural disasters that have added urgency to endemic poverty and violence that have led Central Americans to flee for decades.

Cindy was transferred later to the San Diego Convention Center, where HHS is sheltering hundreds of unaccompanied children. She said the conditions there were ""a thousand times better,"" adding that the staff would periodically check on her and ask her how she was feeling.

In some of those check-ins, Cindy reported experiencing coughs, headaches and fever. A few days later, her symptoms worsened, and personnel at the San Diego facility rushed her to the hospital in an ambulance. Cindy estimates that 100 other girls at the facility tested positive for Covid-19 around that time. As of Monday, 203 children at the San Diego Convention Center had tested positive for the coronavirus, according to an HHS spokesperson.

Cindy was among the 13,350 or so unaccompanied children living in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement at HHS. Over the last year, at least 3,715 unaccompanied children have been diagnosed with Covid-19, according to numbers from the Administration for Children and Families at HHS.

Currently, 528 unaccompanied children who have tested positive for Covid-19 remain in medical isolation. As of March 25, none of the minors who had tested positive had needed hospitalization, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Cindy's case is more recent.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement declined to answer specific questions about Cindy's case, citing ""a matter of policy, in order to protect the privacy and security of the unaccompanied children in our care."" However, a spokesperson for the office said in a statement that its ""first priority is to ensure that unaccompanied children are safe, healthy, and unified with family members or other suitable sponsors as quickly and safely as possible.""

An arduous process

But the reunification process can be an arduous one for families, Goldfinch said. It all starts by ensuring that the child is officially in U.S. custody.

For almost two weeks, Goldfinch and her team would call a hotline to find out Cindy's whereabouts. On Friday, she submitted the required reunification packet so the agency can release Cindy to her mother. And by Saturday, Cindy had been hospitalized with Covid-19.

""So, by that point, my law firm had had repeated communications with the agency, and we were requesting information from them daily,"" Goldfinch said. ""They should have had us registered in their system as representatives, and they should have had Maria Ana's information, as well.""

Maria Ana said she is certain that she is not the only mother who has experienced these struggles trying to find their children within a complex immigration system.

""There are thousands of mothers looking for their children and no one tells them anything and sometimes it’s a lack of communication,"" Maria Ana said. ""We’re scared to talk and lose our children, but I didn’t give up. People would tell me to wait, but no, I’m not waiting. Why would I wait? It’s my daughter.""

291,"Since Covid began, 1 in 6 young adults in Latin America lost work","BOGOTA, Colombia — Across Latin America and the Caribbean, 1 in every 6 people aged 18 to 29 have left work since the coronavirus pandemic began, forcing many to abandon their studies, a report said on Thursday.

The precariousness of employment for young people rose across the region, according to an investigation by the Canadian charity Cuso International based on data from a U.N. commission and a poll by the International Labour Organization.

“It’s extremely difficult for young people to access the labor market due to issues around specialization, lower wages and poverty,” the advocacy group’s Colombia director, Alejandro Matos, told Reuters.

Latin America is bracing for a potential surge in Covid-19 cases that could be worse than last year's.

More than half of those who stopped working since the start of the pandemic were let go by their employers, the report said, while others saw their businesses close and those employed in the informal sector could not work due to lockdowns.

“Feelings of sadness, fear and anxiety, as well as discouragement following the crisis prevail among young people, where a greater proportion than in other age groups say their well-being and mental health has also deteriorated,” the report said.

While job losses among the young caused interruptions in education and training programs, the collapse of businesses and falling wages increased precariousness, underemployment and informal work, the study said.

The majority of job losses came in the first half of 2020, with the numbers of young people in work or education falling by 7.8 percent, it said.

Unemployment particularly afflicted those aged 15 to 24, growing by 3.4 percent, almost twice the rate for those over 25.

“Young people without access to education, training, or professional experience do not accumulate human capital and find themselves increasingly distant from the realm of decent work,” the study said.

Sunnier days are upon us, which means you’ve likely got a few beach trips penciled into your calendar this summer. Beyond flip flops, sunglasses, a towel and a giant umbrella, make sure you’ve saved some room for sunscreen in your beach bag. According to the Centers for Disease Control, skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States. Sun exposure also causes visible signs of aging like wrinkles and hyperpigmentation.

While sunscreen is probably top of mind for you when the weather heats up, it’s actually good practice to wear it year-round.

Which sunscreen should you choose, though?

For starters, the American Dermatology Association (ADA) recommends one that's labeled “broad-spectrum,” because this means it protects against both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays are the ones that prematurely age your skin, causing wrinkles and age spots, while UVB rays cause sunburn. Overexposure to both can lead to skin cancer.

Next, consider the Sun Protection Factor (SPF)

SPF is a measure of how much UVB light a sunscreen can filter out. Dermatologists recommend using an SPF of at least 30, which Adarsh Vijay Mudgil, MD, a dermatologist practicing in New York, calls ""the magic number"". SPF 15 blocks about 93 percent of UVB rays, while SPF 30 blocks about 97 percent of UVB rays. The ADA recommends an SPF of 30 or higher.

It's important to apply enough sunscreen to any exposed area of skin every day. On days you're going to be outdoors for an extended period of time, say playing golf or at the beach or pool, Mudgil suggests putting a base coat of SPF 30 all over the body a half hour before leaving the house and then reapplying every two hours. If you're swimming, Mudgil says it's a good rule of thumb to grab the sunscreen every time you get out of the water.

Remember, no sunscreen can completely protect you from sun so it's important to always reapply throughout the day, wear protective clothing (hats, sun-protective swimwear, clothing, etc.) and always seek shade.

Pay attention to your skin type as well

“If you have acne or oily skin, make sure that your sunscreen is labeled as ‘non-comedogenic,’ which means that it has been shown not to block pores,” says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research, dermatology department, Mount Sinai Hospital. “If you have dry skin, look for moisturizers with sunscreen or sunscreens that contain hydrating ingredients.” (Think: hyaluronic acid or ceramides.)

For sensitive skin, opt for a physical, or mineral, sunscreen, says Emily Smith, MD, dermatologist at University of Missouri Health Care. Physical sunscreen features zinc oxide and titanium dioxide to protect skin; these two ingredients won’t burn or sting eyes, Smith says. They sit on top of your skin, forming a barrier to protect you.",0
293,Do you need to wear sunscreen inside? Experts weigh in,"Sunscreen vs blue light

According to Markowitz, the blue light emitted from digital screens — including your computer, phone, tablet and TV — can affect your skin in two ways:

Blue light can increase the production of melanin or pigmentation in the skin, which could lead to melasma and age spots.

Blue light can also create free radicals, which might cause inflammation and lead to the breakdown of collagen and elastic tissue in the skin.

Is mineral or physical sunscreen better?

If you choose to wear sunscreen indoors, your next step is to decide what formulation meets your skin and SPF needs. According to Gymrek, both chemical and physical blocks are protective against UVA and UVB — as long as they’re labeled SPF 30 or higher and broad spectrum.

Mineral or physical sunscreens

Physical blockers use iron oxide, zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as their active ingredients, says Gymrek.

“These minerals create a physical barrier, blocking the ultraviolet and the blue light from reaching the skin surface,” she explains.Blue light filters on your screens are also very helpful as are blue light blocking glasses.

They’re designed to sit on top of the skin, meaning they’re less likely to clog your pores — a good option for oily and acne-prone skin. However, be careful if you use a mineral sunscreen and topical acne medication, cautions Hadley King, MD, a board-certified dermatologist. The combination of the two can cause dryness because it is non-comedogenic.

Chemical sunscreens

According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, chemical sunscreens “absorb UV rays before they can damage your skin.” With that in mind, they can also absorb into your skin, in contrast to physical sunscreens, which sit atop your skin. That absorption, King noted, could become problematic for your skin. Why? Studies on rats and mice have shown that some sunscreen ingredients negatively impact the reproductive systems, ovaries, mammary glands, testicules and prostates and endocrine systems. The concern is that if these toxic ingredients can absorb into the bloodstream, it could cause long-term health implications in humans. The FDA conducted followup research in 2020 and learned that active sunscreen ingredients ""can remain in the body for extended periods of time"" after one use.

On top of that, chemical sunscreens have negative implications for the environment and marine life, which is why Hawaii is banning the sale of sunblocks with oxybenzone and octinoxate. The law goes into effect on Jan. 1, 2021.

Should you avoid chemical sunscreens?

“We don’t have firm evidence that they (chemical sunscreens) are doing anything that bad (to humans). We have these animal studies, but no, we don’t have firm data that something sinister is afoot, but I think we just have more questions,” says King. “We don’t really know yet if they’re doing anything harmful once they get absorbed.”

King says that “the best sunscreen for you is the one that you’ll actually wear,” whether it’s a chemical or mineral formula. She personally uses and recommends mineral sunblocks to her patients. “With physical blockers, there’s fewer questions and concerns about the safety — both for the environment and the body — and you really don’t have to sacrifice the formula anymore,” she adds.

If you commit to wearing sunscreen indoors, then the pros suggest you reapply every two to six hours, depending on the instructions on the label. The sunscreen might feel like it’s longer-lasting because it’s not absorbing as much UV radiation, so it’s best to follow direction on this one, rather than intuition.

What if you don't want to wear sunscreen indoors?

""If you ask me, the solution to this problem is simple: Get out of the sun. Draw the curtains or move your chair. That's what I've always done. I didn't have to get board-certified in dermatology to learn this simple trick,"" says Kenneth Howe, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at Wexler Dermatology. If you still want to sit in front of a window, Howe says, ""you should probably put on some sunscreen. It's not the best way to deal with the problem, though. I don't don a flame-retardant suit so I can sit by an open oven door.""

When you can’t avoid the sun — while at the beach or out running — then “yes, certainly the risk of skin cancer far out-weights any theoretical concern about exposure to chemical sunscreens,” Howe agrees. “But when you're inside your own house? Just draw the curtains or move away,” he says. “If you simply stay out of sunlight penetrating your windows, no further indoor precautions are necessary.” Unless you're working from home in a windowless room, then most of the medical experts we’ve consulted with advise that you wear sunscreen indoors to protect yourself from the sun's harsh rays.

Best sunscreens to wear indoors in 2020

To help you find the best sunscreen for your indoor use, here are what the dermatologists we spoke to recommended.

Gymrek and Dendy Engelman, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York, are fans of this non-comedogenic, hypoallergenic, oil-, paraben- and fragrance-free SPF. It is a sheer sunscreen that has physical blockers — titanium dioxide and zinc — making it “good for people with sensitive skin and for blue light,” says Engelman. There’s also caffeine in it, which has a low toxicity profile and antioxidant powers to help fight free radicals, according to a study in the US National Library of Medicine.

“Sunscreen is a daily essential for all skin tones, whether you're indoors or outdoors,” says Engelman. Her pick is a great sunscreen for acne and oily skin types because lactic acid will gently exfoliate the skin and regulate sebum build-up. Gymrek wears the niacinamide-infused sunscreen every morning, noting it dries down quickly. Howe says this is a “great versatile SPF that feels great and everyone loves.”

“It's easy to forget that our scalps need sun protection,” says Engelman. Her recommendation includes 24.5-percent zinc oxide and won’t weigh down your hair. “It feels similar to dry shampoo and provides non-greasy UV protection,” she says. After you finish styling your hair, mist the sunblock along your hairline, part it and then massage it into your scalp with either a brush or your fingertips.

“A personal favorite for morning use with my dry skin is Naturopathica’s Daily UV Defense Cream SPF 50 for its smooth-but-thick effect — and its smells divine,” says Markowitz. The full-spectrum mineral sunscreen has green tea extract, which boasts antioxidant and anti-aging benefits for the skin. Engelman suggests that you cover up any exposed skin with about an ounce of sunscreen at a time, although you can adjust the amount based on your body type.

Gymrek “loves” to use this stick sunscreen before exercising because it “never sweats into my eyes.” Skinbetter’s sunblock applies creamy and white and “rubs in easily and leaves no white residue” on her skin. The water-resistant SPF is both a mineral and a physical blocking sunscreen, thanks to the combination of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide.

“It's a common misconception that you only need sunscreen in the summer months, but make no mistake: we can get sun damage at any time in the year, including in the cold months,” says Engelman. “If our skin is unprotected and exposed to the sun's rays for even 15 minutes a day, that can have a very real cumulative impact.”

Rest easy knowing there are sunscreens that are specially formulated for those with a sensitive skin type to use year-round. Gymrek and Markowitz recommend Blue Lizard Sensitive Skin sunscreen, a non-sticky option that offers broad-spectrum (UVA and UVB) protection and that is mineral-based.

Markowitz calls this mineral sunscreen a “light-weight and effective” option for those who want to layer their sunblock. Although all skin types — dry, combination, oily, sensitive and normal — hyaluronic acid and vitamin E hydrates your skin, so it’s best suited for those with dry, normal or sensitive skin.

She also recommends the Supergoop! sunblock to patients with combination skin “who like a smooth, but robust sunscreen.” Before you head out to the grocery store, rub this cruelty-free, reef-safe and vegan SPF gently onto your face and let it sit for about 20 minutes before you put on your antimicrobial face mask. Sunflower extract protects from environmental damage while rosemary leaf extract calms your complexion.

Francesca Fusco, MD, a board-certified dermatologist of Wexler Dermatology, recommends that you brush on this full-spectrum mineral sunscreen with SPF 50. Available in four shades — ranging from Fair to Dark — you can wear this water-resistant sunscreen by itself or layered over your makeup. “It’s not always easy to reapply sunscreen if you’re indoors in a restaurant or at a (pre-coronavirus) party. Color Science SPF powder can be brushed on easily and quickly,” she says.

Engelman advises that you aim to use broad-spectrum coverage, ideally with SPF 50 or higher. Try Howe’s recommendation, which aligns with her suggestion. Shisideo’s hypoallergenic mineral sunscreen is free of parabens, fragrances and alcohol, making it a solid choice for those with sensitive skin. He says the sunblock “goes on really nicely with a smooth, non-tacky finish” and is popular with surfers.

As you and your family enjoy the warm spring weather, sunscreen should remain top of mind. Whether you’re spending a day at the beach, having a picnic in the park or gearing up for a spring barbecue, finding which sunscreens are best for your kids can be difficult.

Of course, you want one that’s going to effectively protect them from sunburns. Daily wear of an SPF 15 sunscreen can lower your risk for melanoma by 50 percent, according to the nonprofit Skin Cancer Foundation. But you also want to make sure that what you’re putting on your child’s extra-delicate skin is completely safe.

SKIP AHEAD Best sunscreen for kids

How to find the best sunscreen for kids

Regardless of age, always choose a sunscreen that’s broad-spectrum, meaning it blocks both UVA and UVB rays, with an SPF 30 at minimum, said Viseslav Tonkovic-Capin, MD, a Kansas City dermatologist and editor of his site DermBoard. UVA rays prematurely age skin, while UVB rays cause sunburns — SPF refers to how much UVB light sunscreen can filter out.

Planning a fun day in the pool or a socially-distant weekend trip to the beach? “If your child will be partaking in water activities, make sure to look for a formula that is water-resistant,” said Gretchen Frieling, MD, a dermatopathologist in Boston. Sunscreen can be labeled water-resistant for up to 40 or 80 minutes, so you’ll still have to reapply regularly.

As for the type of sunscreen you use on your child, dermatologists advise sticking to mineral (also known as physical) formulas, rather than chemical ones, for a variety of reasons. “I prefer zinc oxide-based products, as unlike chemicals, they block out the full UV spectrum,"" said Kenneth Mark, MD, a dermatologist and Mohs skin cancer surgeon in New York City. Plus, mineral sunscreens don’t absorb in the skin the way chemical ones do, are generally less irritating and are also better for the environment, noted Tonkovic-Capin.

While spray sunscreens are a popular choice among older kids and teens, Tonkovic-Capin prefers lotions and creams. “Sunscreens are designed to go onto your skin and not into your lungs or the lungs of other people around you when you try to spray it onto your skin,” he said. And as Sheel Desai Solomon, MD, a dermatologist in Raleigh/Durham, pointed out, “spray makes it difficult to regulate the amount you are putting on, meaning you can put on less than you need.”

How to apply sunscreen to your kids

“Kids need sunscreen and rely on adults to apply it when they are too young to apply on themselves,” said Tess Mauricio, MD, a dermatologist in Beverly Hills. Apply approximately half a teaspoon of sunscreen to your child’s face and one ounce to their entire body, and remember to reapply every two hours (or any time they get wet), added Susan Bard, MD, a dermatologist in New York City.

Raising a tween or teen? Teaching them about the importance of applying, and reapplying, sunscreen is key, said Solomon. That said, “some teens and young adults are concerned and embarrassed by the shiny residue some sunscreen products leave behind so they apply an insufficient amount of protection,” Solomon said. “If your child has these concerns, talk to them and instill in them the importance of protecting our skin.” Tonkovic-Capin suggested moving on to another brand until you find one you and your kids absolutely like to use.

Other sun safety tips for children

“The biggest misconception is that it is good enough just to use a sunscreen for adequate protection from the sun,” said Tonkovic-Capin. Other steps you should take to keep your kids sun-safe are avoiding taking them out during peak UV hours (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.) and putting them in protective clothing, a broad-brimmed hat and UV-blocking sunglasses when they are outside, said Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. You should also always seek shade when the family is outside.

The best sunscreen for kids

To help you and your family practice a sun protection routine, we’ve gathered the best sunscreens for kids. Here are dermatologists top picks.

Solomon cited Aveeno as one of her go-to brands when looking for a good kids’ sunscreen. This mineral sunscreen has a mild, hypoallergenic formula that won’t cause irritation or stinging, and it’s water resistant for 80 minutes. It boasts a 4.6-star average from more than 3,000 reviews on Amazon.

“This mineral blocker sunscreen contains only zinc oxide for broad-spectrum protection that can be used by anyone, even kids and those with sensitive skin,” said Joshua Zeichner, MD, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City. Neutrogena’s SheerZinc has a hypoallergenic formula and is free of fragrance and dyes, which helps to prevent irritation on your child’s sensitive skin. It’s also water-resistant up to 80 minutes. It received a 4.1-star average from more than 200 reviews on Neutrogena.

This physical sunscreen is a favorite of King’s because you can throw it in your bag for easy re-application. “The powder format is so easy to apply so kids won't complain about goopy sunscreen, there's no smell and it's translucent,” she said. “And the brush is soft and brightly colored so it's fun to apply.” It earned a 4.1-star average from more than 300 reviews on Amazon.

Mark likes this sunscreen for kids because it’s made with 21 percent zinc oxide and safe for babies six months and up. “It’s also free of fragrance, parabens, phthalates, dyes and irritating chemicals,” he said. This sunscreen was designed to be lightweight and specifically for the face, plus it is also water-resistant for up to 80 minutes. The liquid formula is hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic and oil-free, meaning it shouldn't cause pimples, and plays nicely under makeup — so feel free to borrow your child's sunscreen if you're wearing cosmetics. It boasts a 4.4-star average from more than 1,500 reviews on Amazon.

Another brand Solomon likes is Babyganics. For the littlest of little ones, this mineral formula not only protects a baby’s delicate skin with SPF 50, but it also nourishes with a seed oil blend. It is meant to be non-allergenic and tear-free, so parents don’t have to worry about irritating their child’s sensitive skin when trying to protect them from the sun. Babyganics said this formula is also free of pesky ingredients such as PABA, phthalates, parabens, fragrances and nano-particles. This sunscreen received a 4-star average rating from more than 170 reviews on Target.

For the child who just doesn’t want to wear sunscreen, this glitter-packed sunscreen is a game-changer. “This is a completely mineral based sunscreen and a great way to get kids excited about putting on their sunscreen,” said Bard. As a bonus, the formula is biodegradable. It received a 4.4-star average from nearly 140 reviews on Amazon.

Teens dealing with acne breakouts may not be too keen on applying sunscreen. Enter Proactiv's formula (which is a chemical, rather than a physical blocker), a favorite of Mauricio. “For older kids and teenagers who are starting to have issues with oily skin, clogged pores, whiteheads, blackheads and acne, this sunscreen can help add moisture, reduce shine and also protect the skin from UV damage,” she said. It earned a 4.6-star average rating from more than 440 reviews on Amazon.

Baby Bum’s stick sunscreen is the No. 1 bestseller in the Baby Sun Protection category on Amazon. The full-spectrum sunscreen was created with hydrating ingredients like coconut oil and shea butter. It boasts a 4.7-star average rating from more than 5,000 reviews on Amazon.

This hypoallergenic sunscreen is made with only seven ingredients and received a 4.3-star average from more than 2,800 reviews on Google Shopping. It offers broad-spectrum SPF 30 coverage, and is both water- and sweat-resistant for up to 40 minutes, according to the brand.

Blue Lizard’s mineral sunscreen is free of both parabens and fragrances, making it a safer bet for kids with sensitive skin. This sunscreen lotion offers twice as much water- and sweat-resistance (80 minutes) compared to the aforementioned Badger sunscreen.

295,"Best sunscreen for dark skin tones, according to dermatologists","Madelyn Fernstrom, PhD, CNS, debunked the notion that we don't need to wear sunscreen for a story on NBC Know Your Value. ""All skin tones must be protected from the sun to prevent damage, with the same protection needed for darker and lighter skin types,"" she wrote. Fernstrom said melanin-rich skin tends to deal with discoloration, and sun exposure can worsen dark spots' appearance.

According to two editors we consulted, there is a misconception in the Black community that we don't need to wear sunscreen. ""I'm adamant about wearing sunscreen because for so long, Black people were under the false impression that we didn't need sunscreen, which is a total myth I wish I could put on a billboard,"" said Allen. Angel Lenise, video supervisor at ELLE.com and co-founder of beauty retailer AMP Beauty LA, said growing up in Texas as a Black woman, she didn't realize sunscreen is essential for Black people to apply outside of summer swimming.

Lenise noted the misconception of not needing sunscreen may also stem from previous generations in the South who had limited access to pools and beaches, and assumed they only needed sunscreen while swimming. The effects of the sun like burning and age spots made the need for sunscreen quite clear for people with light skin. But because Black people don't always deal with those effects, it wasn't as clear that we couldn't be so nonchalant about applying sun protection. “There's also this notion that you don't wanna be in the sun too long because you don't want to get too dark,” Lenise added, noting that it’s part of “what has been embedded in us as people, in terms of colorism and self-hatred: The lighter you are, the easier you will have it.""

What SPF is best for dark skin?

The dermatologists we consulted recommend a minimum of SPF 30 — as does the American Academy of Dermatology. However, Henry recommends you apply SPF 50 if you're outside for more than an hour. You should also reapply that sunscreen every two hours — more frequently if you’re sweating or taking a dip in water because it rinses off and the efficacy breaks down.

So, what happens if you don’t wear sunscreen? ""There is all this foolishness about 'Black don't crack' and I find it really annoying. The reality is that Black can and does crack,"" said Downie. Aesthetically, she said common issues Black people face when they don't wear sunscreen are large pore sizes, patchy pigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles.

What causes white cast in sunscreen — and how to avoid it?

While sunscreen is essential to protect against sun damage, those ingredients weren't always designed with Black people in mind. When Chloe Hall shops for sunscreen, she looks for options that won't leave behind a white cast, which has been a ""major problem"" for her. ""I want a sunscreen that can blend naturally with all skin tones,"" said Hall, the beauty director of ELLE. Nerisha Penrose, an assistant editor at ELLE, added: ""The sun's rays don't discriminate, but some of the SPFs on the market do.""

""A lot of sunscreens have been inelegant"" because they are chalky and make Black people look ashy and ghost-like, Henry said, adding that mineral sunscreens, opaque physical blockers sitting on top of the skin and reflecting light, typically leave behind a white cast. ""That's why chemical sunscreens were created — these chemicals bond to the skin and convert UV light into heat,"" said Henry. She explained that mineral sunscreens have become ""a lot more elegant on the skin"" because they are micronized, or made with smaller particles, and are thus less visible on the skin. ""Now we have sunscreens that you really can't see on darker skin types,"" she said.

We asked these dermatologists and beauty editors to share their favorite sunscreens that blend seamlessly into melanin-rich skin. Their recommendations range from a tinted mineral sunscreen to 2-in-1 products that simplify their morning beauty routines. Shop the best sunscreens for Black people in 2020 that won't leave behind a ghost-like finish to your skin.

Best sunscreen for darker skin tones

""Ask any Black girl to show you her beauty staples and I guarantee you'll see this sunscreen,"" said Penrose. ""The Black Girl Sunscreen was made for us and by us."" Penrose, who has dry skin, appreciates the hydrating and vegan ingredients found in the sunscreen, including avocado and jojoba oils. Hall began using this sunscreen after Penrose recommended it to her. ""It's ultra-sheer and never leaves me with a weird white cast. Plus, I love that it's packed with cocoa butter and avocado oil so it's super nourishing,"" she said. Lenise also uses this SPF and calls the formula ""great"" and ""amazing"" because she doesn't get a white cast when she uses this sunscreen. ""Everyone should absolutely believe the hype of Black Girl Sunscreen,"" said Allen, who added the ""brand is normalizing inclusive sunscreen that works with our skin, not against it — white residue is not welcome here.""

Penrose began using Renée Rouleau Weightless Protection SPF 30 at the beginning of quarantine in March, ""and it's held me down ever since."" ""As the name suggests, it glides on like a dream and doesn't feel too cakey on the skin, and doubles as a moisturizer or primer, especially in the summer,"" she said. The vegan sunscreen offers UVA and UVB protection, green tea soothes your complexion and licorice extract helps calm inflammation.

Nykia Spradley, commerce editor at Allure.com, said she wears sunscreen whenever she's outdoors and admitted she's ""trying to be better"" about wearing SPF indoors. ""I really feel like it's the easiest and most effective way to stay looking young, that's why I make it a priority,"" she told us. Spradley recommended Glossier Invisible Shield for daily use because it ""feels weightless"" and plays nicely with her skin care products, including moisturizer. Glossier said this SPF sports an ""antioxidant complex"" of vitamin E and vitamin P, along with broccoli and aloe leaf extracts to help fight free radicals.

""I'm not a fan of the thick, weighty feel of classic sunscreens, so this light-as-a-feather formula changed everything for me once I experienced its sensorial, gel-based texture that sinks into the skin so seamlessly,"" said Allen. Spradley wants her sunscreen to be sheer so she doesn't have to ""rub extra hard"" for it to blend into her skin. ""I don't want to see any traces of it if I'm wearing it alone,"" she said. Another non-negotiable? SPF 30 or higher and mineral sunscreen. She likes to apply this SPF 40 mineral sunscreen because it glides on clear and she said it's ""a win all around, even when my skin is a bit more tanned."" Henry also recommended this sunscreen because ""it's literally unseen and clear from the offset — it looks like a makeup primer when you apply it,"" she said.

Lenise prefers Supergoop! Everyday Play, a broad-spectrum sunscreen that she applies to her face and body. ""Normally the higher the SPF, probably the thicker the consistency is because it offers and affords you more protection. This is the highest SPF I have at home and it's still no (white) cast at all,"" she said. Sunflower extract, which is rich in antioxidants and helps protect your skin against environmental damage, while rosemary leaf extract has antioxidants to calm your complexion. It's a fragrance-, oil-, cruelty- and gluten-free sunscreen that's water-resistant for up to 80 minutes and it works on all skin types.

Hall also recommended Bolden's 2-in-1 face moisturizer with SPF 30 because it hydrates, brightens and protects her skin from the sun or, as Hall said, ""it does it all."" Vitamin C evens skin tone, squalane improves texture and fine lines while safflower oil calms inflammation and hydrates. Prioritize supporting Black-owned businesses? Rest easy: Bolden was created by two Black women with melanin-rich skin in mind.

Hall called Unsun her ""favorite mineral-tinted sunscreen."" Katonya Breaux, Frank Ocean's mom, created the line of tinted sunscreen with darker skin tones in mind. The company said the shade Medium/Dark works for olive-to-chocolate complexions and offers a sheer wash of coverage to your skin. Shea butter and coconut, safflower plus olive oils keep your skin well-moisturized and aloe leaf juice calms inflammation. The sunscreen works for all skin types, including sensitive skin, and if you value clean and natural beauty products, consider that Unsun is available to shop at Credo Beauty, which said it banned products that include any of the 2,700 ingredients found on their ""dirty list.""

""UrbanSkinRX is not a Black-owned brand but they still make products with us at top of mind. Their brand has a melanin expert and their products are really awesome,"" said Lenise. She called the sunscreen ""super gentle"" because it doesn't clog her pores and the consistency ""feels like an amazing moisturizer."" It's also fragrance-free, which is ""super important"" for her sensitive skin needs. A trio of good-for-you skin care ingredients — vitamin E, hyaluronic acid and squalane — hydrate, smooth and help correct uneven skin tone. The company said the vegan sunscreen isn't tested on animals and is paraben-, toxin-, sulfate- and fragrance-free.

Downie's ""absolute favorite"" sunscreen is SkinMedica Total Defense. It offers UVA/UVB protection and a blend of antioxidants to help protect against infrared waves, an invisible light ray that we interpret as heat. Downie said infrared heat — opening a hot oven, cooking pasta, walking down a hot sidewalk and having heat radiate up to your face and getting in a “super hot” car — can also affect your skin. “Infrared heat and infrared rays are harmful to our skin,” said Downie. She said “very few sunblocks” available have infrared protection, and the technology has only been available since about 2017. “Most sunblocks have anti-UVA and anti-UVB sun protection. This is one of the only sunblocks on the market that has anti-infrared protection,” she added. Downie also said it rubs into her brown skin without leaving behind a white cast. She appreciates it's hypoallergenic and fragrance-free, as well, because she has “extra sensitive skin” near her eyes, underlying eczema and acne-prone skin.

“This is going to slow down your aging significantly,” said Downie. The brush-on sunscreen — available in both SPF 30 and SPF 50 options — is tinted and available in Tan and Deep. She said they last about a year, and her female clients “love them” because they can reapply the sunblock over their makeup or to tone down shine in the hot summer months. They also offer broad-spectrum coverage and are water-resistant for up to 80 minutes, making it a great option for sunny days by your local lake.

Allen likes to use this spray sunscreen for beach days because it offers SPF 55 and ""takes the guesswork out of things when it comes to reapplying. It literally only takes two seconds to mist, then go on about your day,"" said Allen. Her go-to tip for staying protected while outdoors? Keep your sunscreen next to your beverage so that you don't forget to spritz. The lightweight, oil-free and non-comedogenic sunblock offers UVA/UVB protection.

296,Shrinking sea meadows add to carbon emission concerns,"Hundreds of miles from the nearest shore, ribbon-like fronds flutter in the ocean currents sweeping across an underwater mountain plateau the size of Switzerland.

A remote-powered camera glides through the sunlit, turquoise waters of this corner of the western Indian Ocean, capturing rare footage of what scientists believe is the world’s largest seagrass meadow.

Human activity is helping destroy the equivalent of a soccer field of these seagrasses every 30 minutes around the world, according to the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP). And scientists are now racing to take stock of what remains.

“There are a lot of unknowns — even things as simple as how much seagrass we have,” said Oxford University earth observation scientist Gwilym Rowlands, who is helping the Seychelles government map the island nation’s seagrass and estimate how much carbon it stores.

“If you look at the map data for seagrass, there are huge holes” in what we know.

Seagrasses play a large role in regulating ocean environments, storing more than twice as much carbon from planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) per square mile as forests do on land, according to a 2012 study in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Countries that hope to earn credit toward bringing down their CO2 emissions could tally their seagrasses and the carbon they store, a first step toward accrediting carbon offsets for eventual trading on an open market.

The grasses also curb the acidity of surrounding waters — an especially important function as the ocean absorbs more CO2 from the atmosphere and becomes more acidic.

But seagrasses provide some buffer from acidification, which can damage animals’ shells and disrupt fish behaviors. In one study published March 31 in the journal Global Change Biology, scientists at the University of California, Davis, found that seagrasses dotted along the California coast could reduce local acidity by up to 30 percent for extended periods.

The plants also help clean polluted water, support fisheries, protect coasts from erosion, and trap micro-plastics, said the study’s lead author Aurora Ricart.

“What is even cooler is that these habitats are present everywhere,” she said.

While most seagrasses fringe coastlines around the world, the shallowness of Saya de Malha allows sunlight to filter to the seabed, creating an aquatic prairie in the Indian Ocean that provides shelter, nurseries and feeding grounds for thousands of marine species.

The bank’s isolation has helped protect it from coastal threats, including pollution and dredging. But even such remote stretches of international waters face increasing incursions from shipping and industrial fishing.

In March, scientists from institutions including Britain’s Exeter University travelled with Greenpeace on an expedition to collect some of the first field data on the area’s wildlife, including its little-studied beds of seagrass.

With the boat bobbing for days above the plateau, the researchers gathered bits of grass floating in the water, tweezering them into bottles for analysis back on shore.

Data on seagrass meadows are patchy, but research so far estimates the grasses cover over 300,000 square km (115,000 square miles), distributed across all continents apart from Antarctica, according to UNEP. That would be an area the size of Italy.

It is not yet known how much carbon is locked into Saya de Malha, but globally the tangled roots of seagrasses are estimated to trap over 10 percent of the carbon buried in ocean sediment per year.

“This has massive implications for the (world’s) climate change mitigation efforts,” said Dimos Traganos, lead scientist on a German Aerospace Center project developing software to improve seagrass tracking using satellite imagery and other data. That effort has been helped by recent advances in cloud computing and data storage, he said. “We are in such an exciting period.”

Seagrass meadows are believed to be retreating around 7 percent per year globally, according to the most recent seagrass census published in a 2009 study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It notes the estimate was based on incomplete data available at the time.

The more closely studied areas illustrate the harm human activity can cause. Pollution from mining and damage by fisheries may have helped to eliminate 92 percent of mainland Britain’s seagrasses in over a century, according to a March 4 study in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.

If still intact, these could have supported around 400 million fish and stored up to 11.5 million tonnes of carbon — equivalent to 3 percent of Britain’s CO2 emissions in 2017, the study said.

This year, Seychelles began assessing its coastal seagrass carbon stock for the first time, and at least 10 countries have said seagrasses would play a part in their climate action plans, according to UNEP.

Seychelles and Mauritius, which have joint jurisdiction over the Saya de Malha’s seabed, should count up and care for the wealth of seagrass on their shared doorstep, said James Michel, who served 12 years as president of the Seychelles until 2016.

“Then we’ll be in a better position to know how to not only preserve it, but also to manage it to ensure that it is protected for the future.”",0
297,'Tantalizing' results of 2 experiments defy physics rulebook,"Preliminary results from two experiments suggest something could be wrong with the basic way physicists think the universe works, a prospect that has the field of particle physics both baffled and thrilled.

The tiniest particles aren’t quite doing what is expected of them when spun around two different long-running experiments in the United States and Europe. The confounding results — if proven right — reveal major problems with the rulebook physicists use to describe and understand how the universe works at the subatomic level.

Theoretical physicist Matthew McCullough of CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, said untangling the mysteries could “take us beyond our current understanding of nature.”

The rulebook, called the Standard Model, was developed about 50 years ago. Experiments performed over decades affirmed over and again that its descriptions of the particles and the forces that make up and govern the universe were pretty much on the mark. Until now.

“New particles, new physics might be just beyond our research,” said Wayne State University particle physicist Alexey Petrov. “It’s tantalizing.”

The United States Energy Department’s Fermilab announced results Wednesday of 8.2 billion races along a track outside Chicago that while ho-hum to most people have physicists astir: The magnetic field around a fleeting subatomic particle is not what the Standard Model says it should be. This follows new results published last month from CERN’s Large Hadron Collider that found a surprising proportion of particles in the aftermath of high-speed collisions.

Petrov, who wasn’t involved in either experiment, was initially skeptical of the Large Hadron Collider results when hints first emerged in 2014. With the latest, more comprehensive results, he said he is now is “cautiously ecstatic.”

The point of the experiments, explains Johns Hopkins University theoretical physicist David Kaplan, is to pull apart particles and find out if there’s “something funny going on” with both the particles and the seemingly empty space between them.

“The secrets don’t just live in matter. They live in something that seems to fill in all of space and time. These are quantum fields,” Kaplan said. “We’re putting energy into the vacuum and seeing what comes out.”

Both sets of results involve the strange, fleeting particle called the muon. The muon is the heavier cousin to the electron that orbits an atom’s center. But the muon is not part of the atom, it is unstable and normally exists for only two microseconds. After it was discovered in cosmic rays in 1936 it so confounded scientists that a famous physicist asked “Who ordered that?”

“Since the very beginning it was making physicists scratch their heads,” said Graziano Venanzoni, an experimental physicist at an Italian national lab, who is one of the top scientists on the U.S. Fermilab experiment, called Muon g-2.

The experiment sends muons around a magnetized track that keeps the particles in existence long enough for researchers to get a closer look at them. Preliminary results suggest that the magnetic “spin” of the muons is 0.1% off what the Standard Model predicts. That may not sound like much, but to particle physicists it is huge — more than enough to upend current understanding.

Researchers need another year or two to finish analyzing the results of all of the laps around the 50-foot (14-meter) track. If the results don’t change, it will count as a major discovery, Venanzoni said.

Separately, at the world’s largest atom smasher at CERN, physicists have been crashing protons against each other there to see what happens after. One of the particle colliders’ several separate experiments measures what happens when particles called beauty or bottom quarks collide.

The Standard Model predicts that these beauty quark crashes should result in equal numbers of electrons and muons. It’s sort of like flipping a coin 1,000 times and getting about equal numbers of heads and tails, said Large Hadron Collider beauty experiment chief Chris Parkes.

But that’s not what happened.

Researchers pored over the data from several years and a few thousand crashes and found a 15 percent difference, with significantly more electrons than muons, said experiment researcher Sheldon Stone of Syracuse University.

Neither experiment is being called an official discovery yet because there is still a tiny chance that the results are statistical quirks. Running the experiments more times — planned in both cases — could, in a year or two, reach the incredibly stringent statistical requirements for physics to hail it as a discovery, researchers said.

If the results do hold, they would upend “every other calculation made” in the world of particle physics, Kaplan said.

“This is not a fudge factor. This is something wrong,” Kaplan said.

He explained that there may be some kind of undiscovered particle — or force — that could explain both strange results.

Or these may be mistakes. In 2011, a strange finding that a particle called a neutrino seemed to be traveling faster than light threatened the model, but it turned out to be the result of a loose electrical connection problem in the experiment.

“We checked all our cable connections and we’ve done what we can to check our data,” Stone said. “We’re kind of confident, but you never know.”",0

299,How to avoid the flu: Disinfect your house to kill the flu virus,"Flu activity over the last year has been “unusually low” compared with past years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but that doesn't mean you should get in the habit of letting your guard down. In addition to following COVID-19 safety protocols, like wearing face masks when interacting with others outside of your household, maintaining social distance and frequently washing hands, which can also reduce your risk of catching the flu, it's important to learn the best ways to disinfect the house, especially if someone in your home does get infected by influenza.

Follow these recommendations from Dr. Tanya Altmann, a pediatrician and spokesperson for Clorox, and Meg Roberts, former president of Molly Maid cleaning company, to help keep flu germs from spreading in your home.

1. Quarantine the sick person

The flu spreads when the sick person coughs, sneezes or even talks, affecting people as far as 6 feet away! Flu germs are also spread by touching a surface that has flu viruses on it. That’s why Roberts recommends keeping the sick person confined to one room and one bathroom. It reduces exposure to the rest of the family, and limits the number of rooms you have to disinfect.

2. Disinfect surfaces

Since the flu virus can live on hard surfaces for 24 hours, it's important to clean the house after the flu has been detected. Disinfect surfaces that the sick person has touched, paying special attention to the sick person’s bedroom and bathroom. Use an antibacterial cleaner on key spots such as: tabletops, countertops, remote controls, computer keyboards, doorknobs, sinks, light switches, faucet handles, sinks, countertop, tub and toilet (including the entire seat and the toilet handle).

“To disinfect a surface,"" say Altmann, ""wipe so that the surface remains visibly wet for four minutes and then let it dry.”

Another option is to disinfect hard surfaces by wiping or mopping with a solution of 1/2 cup of bleach per gallon of water. Allow the solution to be in contact with the surface for at least five minutes. Rinse and air-dry.

Take care not to spread germs unintentionally. After mopping floors in the contaminated room and the designated bathroom, disinfect the mop head by soaking it for 15-20 minutes in a solution of 1/2 cup bleach and one gallon of water. Also, do not re-use cleaning cloths in other parts of the house. Toss them in the washer instead.

To sanitize kiddie items such as non-electric plastic/metal toys, sippy cups, teething rings, bottle nipples and dishes, wash items first then soak them for two minutes in a solution of 2 teaspoons of bleach per gallon of water. Rinse in warm water then air dry.

3. Three timely tips for the bathroom

Use disposable cups in the bathroom.

Never share hand towels or bath towels with a sick person. Use paper towels instead of cloth hand towels to help prevent the spread of germs.

Keep toothbrushes uncovered and isolate the toothbrush of the sick person from those of other family members.

4. Reduce germs in the bedroom

Add these ideas to your regular bedroom-cleaning regimen:

Place a wastebasket in the sick room to catch all those used tissues — and make sure to line the basket with a plastic grocery bag to minimize contact with germs. Empty at least once a day, replacing bags each time.

Sometimes the wastebasket get grungy — especially if the sick person vomits in it. To disinfect it, rinse the wastebasket well then wipe the inside and outside with a solution of 1/2 cup bleach and 3/4 gallon of water. Allow two minutes for disinfecting then rinse with warm water and air dry.

Dust can be extra irritating when someone’s sick, so Roberts recommends dusting furniture — especially the headboard and the nightstand — and vacuuming the floor. Remember corners and under the bed.

Move stale air out and fresh air into the bedroom by opening the windows every day. You don’t have to leave them open all day, just long enough to freshen the room.

5. Take care when doing laundry

A sick person's towels, bedding and clothes (and the clothes of the caregiver, too) are full of germs, so don’t “hug” dirty clothes as you take them to the washer. This could spread the germs onto you. Instead, transport dirty clothes in a laundry basket and wash your hands after loading the washer.

Sanitize your laundry with bleach — regular bleach for whites and color-safe bleach for colors. (Be sure to follow fabric care instructions on label.) Add 2/3 cup of bleach (1/3 cup for HE machines) to the dispenser or wash water. Add clothes and start to wash, making sure the laundry is in contact with the bleach solution for ten minutes, says Altmann.

After washing the bed sheets, clothes and towels of a sick family member, take time to wash your washing machine. The moist environment in the washer is a breeding ground for germs. Run an empty cycle of hot water and add bleach to the dispenser, then run an additional cycle to ensure the bleach is gone.

6. Don’t use sponges for cleaning

While the flu’s in your home, use disposable paper towels or germ-grabbing microfiber cloths for cleaning. Just remember to wash microfiber cloths daily.

7. A word to the wise

Clean hands are just as important as a clean house, especially during flu season. To kill germs, wash hands all over with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. (For kids, sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice.) Everyone should wash hands after using the bathroom, being outside or being in contact with the sick person; before eating, and before touching the eyes, nose or mouth. (That’s usually how germs enter your body and get you sick.)

If you haven’t already done so, get the flu shot. Though it typically starts in October and peaks between December and February, flu activity can last as late as May in the U.S. — and the flu shot is even more important for keeping your immunity up during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, according to the CDC.

If you get the flu, the CDC recommends taking an antiviral medication like Tamiflu, which can be effective even if taken beyond the recommended second day of sickness.

300,How to clean wood cutting boards the right way,"A wooden cutting board can make for a perfect accent in an open kitchen. Something about chopping up vegetables on a plank made from organic material feels both luxurious and very chic at the same time.

But let's get real: Once you've moved on to the messier stuff, like meat, that cutting board starts to lose its crisp, clean appeal. So, how do you clean a large wooden cutting board, how do you clean a wood chopping block and how do you remove stains from a wooden cutting board?

Great news! There are so many ways to clean every kind of cutting board mess.

""Make sure you are sealing your cutting board with mineral oil every month if it is wood, it helps the board last longer and ward off stains and bacteria from setting in,"" Melissa Maker, author of ""Clean My Space: The Secret to Cleaning Better, Faster — And Loving Your Home Every Day"" told TODAY Home.

""To clean, wipe off all debris with a damp cloth and sprinkle board with coarse salt, about a 1/2 cup should do. Halve a lemon and use the fleshy side to scrub the board in a circular motion, working from left to right, top to bottom. When done, give the board a quick rinse or wipe down and blot dry.""

Check out some of our favorite methods here including Maker's lemon-and-salt method and read on for even more we weren't able to fit into the video!

How to clean a wooden cutting board

Here are five easy methods for cleaning and maintaining a wooden cutting board.

The homemade paste: If your mess requires something a little more TLC, you can make a DIY cleaning paste to take care of it. Combine one tablespoon baking soda, one tablespoon salt and one tablespoon water. Cover the board in the homemade paste and scrub away any grime. The lemon-and-salt method: This option's super easy and smells great. All you need is a lemon and some salt. Sprinkle salt liberally over the cutting board. Cut a lemon in half and rub the salted cutting board with the cut side of the lemon. Rinse off with water. The paper towel trick: For a quick clean, all you need is two paper towels, a little vinegar and some hydrogen peroxide. Dampen one paper towel with white vinegar and wipe down the board. Then dampen the other paper towel with hydrogen peroxide and wipe the board again. So quick and simple! The heavy-duty option: After cutting meat or seafood on a wooden cutting board, you'll want to enlist this heavy duty cleaning hack. Combine one teaspoon of bleach with two quarts of water. Cover the board in the bleach solution and let sit for a few minutes. Rinse thoroughly with hot water. The quickest method: This procedure is very quick, which is part of the reason why we love it so much. It's also great at removing stains (we're looking at you, red onion). Once the cutting board is completely dry, sprinkle salt all over the surface. Scrub the board using a clean sponge soaked in hot water. That's it!

301,How to clean and disinfect your home to protect it from COVID-19,"You can’t control the cleanliness of what you touch outside the home, such as surfaces in stores or on public transportation. But within your home, there are specific steps you can take to protect yourself and your family from COVID-19 and other germs.

Connie Steed, president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, has some tips for how to clean and disinfect the house against infection.

Tips: Cleaning for coronavirus

These tips should be used in conjunction with basic of coronavirus prevention guidelines: Wear a face mask that covers your nose and mouth when interacting with people outside your household, maintain social distance, regularly wash your hands for at least 20 seconds, use hand sanitizer, avoid touching your face, cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and stay home if you are sick (unless seeking medical treatment). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommends getting a COVID-19 vaccine when it's available to you.

1. Clean commonly touched surfaces

The COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person when people come into contact with an infected person’s respiratory droplets at close range. While surface transmission isn't considered to be a common way to get infected, it may be possible for the virus to spread if you touch a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touch your own eyes, nose or mouth, according to the CDC. You can also contract the cold or flu and other viruses this way, so it's a good idea to remain diligent about cleaning surfaces.

Steed recommends daily cleaning of “high-touch” surfaces around the home, such as doorknobs, light switches, countertops and cabinet handles.

“You don't really need to go out and buy some super disinfectant — just a household detergent and water is sufficient,” Steed told TODAY Home. She noted that if a surface is particularly dirty, you should wash with water and detergent and then disinfect it.

NBC News investigative and consumer correspondent Vicky Nguyen stressed that if you use a wipe or a spray, let it air dry to help kill the germs.

2. Use the right cleaning supplies

When it comes to supplies like sponges and mops, Steed recommends sticking with disposable wipes or cloths.

“These really are ideal for cleaning in the home because you can dispose of them after one use,” she said.

If you do reuse sponges and cloths, “they really should be washed in hot water and dried on the hottest setting after each use,” Steed said. “Mop heads should be rinsed in hot water after each use until the water sort of runs clear, and then they should be rung out completely and left to air dry.”

Also, when using disinfectants, Steed advises people to follow manufacturer instructions carefully. Some cleaning fluids may need to sit wet on a surface for a certain number of minutes to be effective.

The American Chemistry Council has compiled a list of common EPA-approved household cleaning products that are effective in fighting the coronavirus — check out the list here.

3. Don’t forget electronics

Your phone could be an infected surface hiding in plain sight. Phones often travel everywhere with us throughout the day, potentially picking up germs along the way.

“It is something that people just don’t think of,” Steed said. “(Phones have) become extensions of ourselves.”

She recommends using an alcohol wipe, or else just warm soap and water, to regularly clean the surfaces of your phone. Also, don’t forget to regularly disinfect shared electronics in the home, like computer keyboards and mice, landline phones and remote controls, especially if a sick person has been using them.

4. Some tips for the kitchen

Practice common sense hygiene when it comes to food preparation. Wash your hands and make sure people who are sick don’t come into close contact with shared food.

When someone is sick in the household, give them their own designated plates, drinking glasses and eating utensils. When washing dishes, clean them thoroughly with soap and water. If you have a dishwasher, use the hot setting, Steed recommends.

Make sure to frequently clean high-touch surfaces in the kitchen, such as countertops, drawer pulls and fridge handles.

5. Some tips for the bathroom

Bathrooms should be a “high-priority focus” when it comes to keeping yourself and your family safe from germs, Steed says. She has a few tips for protecting bathrooms from infections:

Frequently clean all surfaces, including the toilet, shower and sink

Keep toothbrushes separate from each other

Regularly wash hand towels — and don’t share hand towels with a sick person

6. Quarantine sick people in the home

The coronavirus can spread between people who are within about 6 feet of each other, according to the CDC. So, if someone in your family is infected, the best way to keep everyone else safe is to give the sick person a separate bedroom and bathroom if possible, Steed says.

The sick person should avoid contact with others in the household, and should only leave the home for medical treatment. The sick person should also wear a mask anytime that contact with others is necessary. It’s also a good idea to limit visitors to the home while someone is sick with COVID-19, the CDC says.

If you're doing a sick person's laundry, the CDC advises using disposable gloves, and do not shake the laundry, which can spread germs. Nguyen said you don't need to worry about the temperature, but make sure you're using enough detergent and dry clothes on high heat.

Also, ensure that shared spaces in your home have good air flow by using an air conditioner or opening a window, weather permitting.

7. Make it a habit

These measures are all important for protecting your home against the coronavirus, but they are also good to follow in general to safeguard against the flu other infections.

“All of this is important for routine maintenance of a home,” Steed said. “You're not going to get people to clean doorknobs every day, I suspect, but … it's not just about this virus. If you've got somebody with flu, if you’ve got somebody with a gastrointestinal infection … this kind of thing should become front line and center at home to help reduce the risk of other people in the home getting sick.”

And finally, once you and your family members become eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, getting vaccinated will also help reduce your risk of getting sick from the coronavirus.

303,How to clean the refrigerator — and how often to do it,"When was the last time you cleaned the refrigerator?

Wiping up the occasional drip and opening a box of baking soda doesn't count. We're talking a full-throttle cleaning that disinfects, organizes and restores order to one of the busiest spots in the home. Did you know that a neglected and dirty fridge can also be costing you more money in energy bills and causing food to spoil faster?

If you're unsure how to properly maintain your appliance, then read on as our experts share smart tips and recommended cleaning schedules for making your fridge sparkle both inside and out.

How to clean the refrigerator — weekly

Wipe up obvious spills and sticky spots.

Wipe sticky residue from containers and bottles.

Check out the fruit and vegetable drawers and discard spoiled produce. Wipe down as needed.

Wipe down the door and handle with a warm water and mild detergent solution. Dry thoroughly.

How to clean the refrigerator — monthly

Shelves

Empty the fridge one shelf at a time.

Toss out the old stuff. Check “use by” dates and FDA guidelines to determine what’s “old.”

Wipe each shelf using a solution of 1 quart cool water and 2 tablespoons baking soda. (Warm or hot water could crack the glass shelving.) Dry. Return items to the fridge.

Drawers

When cleaning out the fridge, remove and empty fruit and vegetable and meat drawers. Discard spoiled produce and meat.

Wash drawers in a solution of lukewarm water and mild detergent, then dry thoroughly, says home safety expert Cheryl Luptowski of National Safety Federation.

Remove stubborn odors by rinsing with a solution of 1 quart of water and 2 tablespoons baking soda, followed by a plain water rinse and then wiping dry. Instead of detergent, cleaning coach Leslie Reichert uses 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar to 1 quart of water to wash and deodorize at the same time.

Arrange produce and meat in drawers and return to the fridge.

Door shelves

Remove items from the door shelves.

Wipe down all shelves as well as any sticky and drippy containers with baking soda and water solution. Dry and return items.

Gasket

Wipe the gasket (the seal on the door) with a mild detergent solution. Dry with a clean cloth.

Pro tip from Doug Rogers, the executive vice president and general manager of Neighborly, a home services platform: To test the seal of the gasket, shut the door on a dollar bill. If it slides out easily, the gasket isn’t sealing tightly. Replace it to save energy and wear and tear on the fridge.

Door

Wipe down the door, edges, handle and top of the refrigerator with mild detergent solution. Dry.

When cleaning a stainless steel refrigerator, apply coconut oil with a soft cloth. Buff to remove excess.

Water dispenser

Because yeast and mold can build up on the dispenser spout, it should be cleaned every month or as needed.

Pro tip from Carl Major, owner of Major Appliance, AC and Heating in Slidell, Louisiana: Major recommends cleaning the spout with a pipe cleaner (or small brush) alternately dipped in warm water, vinegar and hydrogen peroxide (in that order).

For added safety, make sure to replace external water filters as recommended by the manufacturer.

Ice dispenser

The ice dispenser drawer can actually harbor mold and yeast, according to Allen Rathey, founder of Healthy House Institute, so it should be cleaned regularly.

To clean the ice bin, turn the ice maker off, remove the bin and discard the ice. Using lukewarm water and a mild dish detergent, wash the bin, rinse well and then dry.

Cleaning option: Substitute distilled white vinegar for dish detergent.

How to clean the refrigerator — every 3 months

Drip pan

The drip pan, which is almost always located at the bottom of the refrigerator, should be cleaned seasonally to eliminate bacteria and diminish the potential of mold growth, says Rogers.

To clean, remove the kick panel and use a flashlight to find where the defrost drain line empties into the pan. Gently pull the pan out (remember, it may be full of water). Empty the pan and clean it with an all-purpose cleaner or detergent and water. Dry and replace.

How to clean the refrigerator — every 6 months

Condenser coils

Condenser coils filled with refrigerant make refrigeration possible, explains Rogers. But, coils that are caked with dust reduce efficiency, raise energy bills and wear out the compressor more quickly.

Depending on the location of the coils, either pull the fridge away from the wall or remove the snap-off grille at the bottom to reveal the coils. Using a long-handled brush, clean the coils. Vacuum the debris.

Condenser fan

As with the coils, maintenance of the condenser fan will increase the efficiency and life of your fridge, says Rogers.

Consult the owner’s manual to locate the condenser fan. Using a soft brush, remove dust, dirt and pet hair. Vacuum the area.

304,How to clean stainless steel appliances,"Stainless steel: It's beautiful, shiny and can instantly upgrade a kitchen.

But there is a downside. The sleek look shows remnants from everyone who has ever touched it. Fingerprints, scratches, water marks, smudges and whatever else is in the kitchen sticks out like a sore thumb, turning your beautiful, shiny fridge into a fingerprint autograph book.

Luckily, TODAY Home found the magic solution: olive oil.

It turns out that the versatile oil is an effective protector for all your stainless steel woes. So how does it work, exactly? The olive oil actually safeguards against blemishes, Donna Smallin Kuper, certified Home Cleaning Technician and author of ""Cleaning Plain & Simple"" told TODAY.

""Olive oil doesn't clean per se, but when you put a bit of olive oil (or baby oil) on a clean microfiber cloth, the microfiber cloth cleans the surface and the oil leaves behind a light, protective film that helps to repel water spots and smudges from hands and fingers. Wipe the surface with the grain of the stainless steel (on a fridge, it's generally a vertical grain) for best results.""

Smallin Kuper cautions to go easy on the oil so you don't end up with a greasy situation. ""You can always add more to the cloth if needed,"" she said.

305,How to clean a sponge and how often you should replace it,"You probably use it every day — multiple times a day if you don’t have a dishwasher — but are you sure that the kitchen sponge you're using to wipe dirty dishes is safe? A study from 2017 says probably not.

Researchers in Germany found that icky RG2-related bacteria (the kind that can cause foodborne disease) stays on your sponge even if you clean it in the microwave or in boiling water.

“From a long-term perspective, sponge sanitation methods appear not sufficient to effectively reduce the bacterial load in kitchen sponges and might even increase the shares of RG2-related bacteria,” the researchers wrote in the paper.

They went on to suggest we should be changing our sponges every week, adding that it’s an easily affordable option for staying hygienic.

How to clean a sponge

While the study shows that cleaning a sponge doesn't help with all bacteria, it can help kill some germs in between replacements.

The best way to clean a sponge and minimize germs is to wash the sponge daily in hot, soapy water and then microwave it wet for two minutes.

No microwave? You can also clean the sponge in the dishwasher. Simply, wash the sponge and then run it through the dishwasher (top rack) with the drying cycle on. Alternatively, you can soak the sponge for one minute in a solution of 1/2 teaspoon of concentrated bleach to 1 quart of warm water. But it's still a good idea to replace sponges often.

How often should you replace sponges?

When it comes to how often you should change sponges, the bottom line is that it’s probably best to just invest in a giant pack of sponges and swap them out on a weekly basis.

And when it comes to cleaning your kitchen counters, you may want to opt for an antibacterial kitchen wipe or machine-washable microfiber towel that you can bleach or throw in the washing machine on the sanitizing cycle just to be safe.

306,'You are not listening to me': Black women on pain and implicit bias in medicine,"Amy Mason-Cooley was in so much pain this past June that she couldn’t walk, a pain that she describes as feeling like “being sliced open with a rusty hand saw.”

Her husband rushed her to USA Health University Hospital, a familiar trip for the Mobile, Alabama resident. Mason-Cooley, 37, regularly experiences excruciating pain as a result of sickle cell disease, a disorder in which abnormally crescent-shaped red blood cells can get stuck in blood vessels and prevent the flow of blood and oxygen to parts of the body.

After 24 hours at the hospital, her pain still hadn’t subsided, but her doctor decided to take her off of medications despite her pleas that she was unable to walk and was still in crisis.

Amy Mason-Cooley, 37, of Mobile, Alabama, has struggled to get adequate treatment for sickle cell disease. Amy Mason-Cooley

“As soon as he stopped all my medications, my blood count started dropping,” she told TODAY. “It dropped down (low enough that) they started talking about doing a transfusion.”

She advocated for herself, telling the doctor, “I don't want you to be in control of my care because you are not listening to me.”

He ignored her requests and, according to her, even smirked in response. It wasn’t until other medical staff came in and got her back on her medication hours later that she finally stabilized.

“I don't want you to be in control of my care because you are not listening to me.”

Mason-Cooley filed a complaint with the hospital, and recounted her experience in a Facebook post that was shared over 13,000 times before she made it private. The post hit a nerve for numerous people across the country who have been denied appropriate care after their own pain was dismissed.

While the hospital did not return a request for comment, they did post a statement to their Facebook page saying they “investigate all complaints,” after Mason-Cooley’s post went viral.

A shared experience among Black women

Mason-Cooley’s experience is all too familiar to other Black women, who are caught between being considered impervious to pain because of their race, and overly hysterical about pain because of their gender.

“Pain is an area ripe for implicit bias having an impact because it's an extremely subjective area,” said Janice Sabin, a research professor at the University of Washington in Seattle, who studies implicit bias in medicine. “If a person is bleeding, you can figure out how much blood is lost. But someone who has lower back pain, for example, it's a very subjective measure.” Additionally, she said, cultural differences in how people express their pain and how doctors register that expression, can impact pain management care as well.

Mason-Cooley says no matter how she expresses her pain, she runs the risk of being dismissed.

“There’s so much judgment. If you're too calm, then they say, ‘Oh, you're not sick. You don't look sick.’ And then if you're crying and moaning, they say you're exaggerating. I don’t really know what they want from us,” she said, exasperated.

This particularly impacts people suffering from diseases like sickle cell disease, which almost exclusively affects Black people, or fibromyalgia, lupus and endometriosis — diseases that are often misdiagnosed and misunderstood.

Medicine’s history of bias

Medicine has a history of bias, the vestiges of which we are still grappling with today.

A 2016 study found that nearly half of first and second year medical students believed that Black people have thicker skin than white people, and perceived Black people as experiencing less pain than white people, an idea born from 19th century experiments that were conducted by a physician named Thomas Hamilton. He was a wealthy plantation owner who regularly tortured an enslaved Black man named John Brown, creating blisters all over his body in an effort to prove Black skin went deeper than white skin.

A 2019 study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine analyzed data from 14 previously published studies on pain management and found that Black patients were 40% less likely to receive medication for acute pain compared to white patients, and 34% less likely to be prescribed opioids.

“The field of medicine was very complicit historically in racial categorization and biological concepts of race,” said Sabin. Medicine’s role in espousing biological differences between Black and white people laid the foundation for justifying slavery and the inhumane treatment of Black people. Dr. James Marion Sims, known as the founding father of gynecology, conducted experimental surgeries on enslaved Black women without anesthesia, developing a body of work that continues to misrepresent how Black women experience pain.

The slavery-era belief that Black people were hypersexual and simultaneously less intelligent than white people also continues to impact the care that Black women get.

""With Black women there is an assumption that they don't know their bodies, that they don't understand, that they're not educated about their bodies,” Dr. Colene Arnold, a gynecologist who specializes in pelvic pain disorders, told New Hampshire Public Radio’s The Exchange podcast. She pointed to a study that found Black women are less likely to be diagnosed for endometriosis than white women when they were experiencing pelvic pain, and instead, misdiagnosed as having pelvic inflammatory disease, which is typically sexually transmitted.

“When we look at patient testimonies, particularly from Black women ... We're seeing that these typical tropes of Black women are used ... that they are hypersexualized and that if they have some sort of illness or pain, that it's likely self-inflicted in a sense that they did something wrong,” Keisha Ray, an assistant professor at the McGovern Center for Humanities and Ethics in Houston, Texas, told The Exchange.

'I'm here because I'm sick'

In another pain crisis just last year, Mason-Cooley recalls being left in a hospital waiting room for 10 hours until she passed out from pain, only to wake up to a nurse telling her, ""This isn’t a pain clinic,” implying that she was seeking drugs.

“I have straight up told doctors and nurses, ‘If I wanted it to get high, I could do it on the streets for cheaper, with less judgment. I’m here because I’m sick,’” Mason-Cooley said.

Others on Mason-Cooley’s Facebook thread posted about experiencing pain in the middle of the night and forcing themselves to wait until the morning to go to the hospital, because they knew a 2 a.m. trip to the emergency room for severe pain would only result in accusations that they are addicts. It’s a lot of added stress to deal with when you’re struggling with intense pain.

And having untreated pain can have long-term physical, psychological, social and economic consequences. Additionally, say the authors of the 2019 study, pain that’s dismissed causes patients to have less trust in the medical system. That was what Sevon Blake, a 29-year-old Black baker in Queens, New York, experienced.

“I used to have a lot of lower abdominal pain, and I brought up the concern to my doctor multiple times. He would say, “‘It's probably just a little gas, you’re fine’, and just kind of like brush under the rug.”

""... It's gotta stop. We're asking you to listen to us.""

Blake switched from her Asian male doctor to a Black female doctor who took her concerns seriously. Her new doctor listened to her, discussed her options and eventually referred her to a gastroenterologist. It turns out Blake has a gluten intolerance, an issue that was managed with dietary changes. “I didn’t feel like I could talk to my previous doctor, if he was just going to dismiss me, then I’m not going to be proactive and tell him what I’m feeling.”

Mason-Cooley, a vocal advocate for the sickle cell community who spoke on Capitol Hill about the disease in 2018, said all she wants is to be heard.

“I don't want to undermine any doctor or any nurse because it’s a noble job,” she said. “But I know people with sickle cell that have actually died from a heart attack because the pain was so excruciating. No one took it seriously and they passed away. So it's gotta stop. We're asking you to listen to us. We just want to be treated the way you would want your own family treated.”",0
307,'We're looked at as superhuman': How racism affects Black women's mental health,"Denita Parrish worked as a 911 operator for nearly eight years. While she liked helping people, it was tough. Every day she listened to callers recount trauma as she faced racism and microaggressions from co-workers. The job was daunting and overwhelming.

She started seeing a therapist to help. But when her therapist retired, she just stopped going. Finding a new therapist felt like an extra worry.

“All of the real-world things that are going on is affecting me, of course, as a Black woman,” the 38-year-old government employee who lives in Pittsburgh told TODAY. “That's a lot to deal with.”

When Denita Parrish's therapist retired, she went without one for a while. She started training to be a mental health advocate for her community and that has helped her tend to her own mental health. Courtesy Denita Parrish

On top of feeling depressed by systemic racism she faces, Parrish’s concerns about her family adds to it. She frets about her sons, who are 10 and 6, because of police brutality, racism and other factors that put them at greater risk. And, her partner is in jail and it doesn’t seem like he will be paroled soon for his DUI conviction, even though he served his sentence, she said.

“It’s a major stressor. I have two Black boys and their father is in prison,” Parrish said. “I work very hard. I shouldn’t have to put up with this extra stuff.”

Parrish is not alone.

The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health collects some data on Black women and mental health but it isn’t entirely complete, explains Mia Moore Kirby, an assistant professor in the social work department and center of African American studies at University of Texas, Arlington. While African Americans experience mental illness at the same rate as other Americans, they're more likely to receive inadequate care or no care at all. The American Psychiatric Association estimates that one out of every three Black people who need mental health treatment actually receives it.

“There’s no specific information on how many people have diagnoses just because so many people go untreated — and this is for all groups,"" Kirby told TODAY.

Or put another way: “There are pieces of information. But can we speak to the experience of Black women when it comes to health and mental health issues? It's difficult to do that,"" said Cortney Beasley, founder of Put In Black, an online community focused on Black people and mental health, and a therapist at a start-up in San Francisco Bay area, told TODAY.

Barriers to help

Black women are often underrepresented in research and wary of seeking mental health treatment. The reasons behind both sometimes overlap.

“The mistrust that Black people feel towards our health care system ... and the stigma that comes along with mental health issues and going to therapy … it's all been designed in a way that's not really conducive to Black people getting the help they need,” Beasley said.

Medicine has a tragic history of forced experiments on Black people, including the Tuskegee Study and the case of Henrietta Lacks, when doctors took cells from Lacks without her or her family’s permission and used them for research and profited from it. Today, Black women often feel wary about participating in research. Yet, other research simply doesn’t consider Black women.

“Some researchers don't research people of color and then also there's concern associated with us volunteering for studies,” Kirby said. “It's an issue on both sides.”

There’s also a history of social workers (and therapists) recording information to be used against Black women.

Fewer than 5% of psychologists are Black. Even if everyone in the country wanted a Black therapist there wouldn’t be enough of us to go around. Joy Harden Bradford

“I also think that some of that has to do with how social workers — which were the original mental health folks in Black communities — were introduced,” LaNail Plummer, CEO and clinical director of Onyx Therapy Group in Washington, D.C., told TODAY. “In those situations, the social worker, who was the middle person, actually gathered information and that information was later used against the client.”

In addition to structural barriers and systemic racism, many Black women struggle to find a therapist who looks like them — or is culturally competent.

“Fewer than 5% of psychologists are Black. Even if everyone in the country wanted a Black therapist there wouldn’t be enough of us to go around,” Joy Harden Bradford, a psychologist based in Atlanta, Georgia and founder of Therapy for Black Girls, told TODAY.

At 62 years old, Karen Walker is now seeing a Black therapist and she said it’s made a huge difference.

“My treatment now is much better,” the retired nurse’s aide in Pittsburgh, told TODAY. “(My therapist) can respond back to me because of her experiences, real life things that have happened to her and we can talk about it and work things out.”

Walker feels like her therapist now has a “different approach” and makes her want to return. Sometimes when Black women ask for help they feel like they’re not getting the best care or being dismissed. Kirby studied the “strong Black woman” stereotype’s role in mental health and found that it prevents women from receiving care.

“The 'strong black woman concept' (implies that) we're able to handle all things and so sometimes clinicians — who may not be culturally competent — may also speak that language,” Kirby said. “That’s not validating a person's experience, not empathizing with what's going on and maybe minimizing their symptoms. And I think African American women in particular have symptoms minimized. We're looked at as superhuman.”

Marissa Carrington, 27, feels this pressure to be everything. She works for a grassroots organization that focuses on restorative justice practices and conflict resolution. She has two children and recently learned one of her daughters has anxiety and impulse control disorder. In addition, friends and family rely on her to help with their problems. Many days, Carrington felt overwhelmed and mad.

Since paying attention to her mental health, Marissa Carrington feels happier and even uses some of the skills she's learned to help her navigate tricky parenting situations. Courtesy Marissa Carrington

“Basically, my attitude was kind of nasty. Just the things that I have been through made me angry,” she told TODAY. ""I'm just ready to be happy so I just wanted to work on myself.""

Creating space for Black women’s mental health

Carrington attends a program, Beams to Bridges, offered by the Pittsburgh-based Black mental health group Steel Smiling, and feels much happier and even better able to cope with parenting stress. The one-year program teaches ""Mental Health First Aid"" but also destigmatizes mental health. Parrish also attends and even found a new therapist to help her grapple with parenting alone but not being a single parent. Shanell Ware, another participant, feels grateful to have joined when she did. Watching recent videos featuring police brutality has caused her to relive her traumatic experience when police officers choked her during a traffic stop in 2008.

“When it comes up, it brings up the pain,” the 36-year-old, assistant manager at a cleaning company told, TODAY. “I had never spoken out loud about it. My therapist was the first person I expressed how I felt.”

Ware realized being “bottled up with hurt and pain” made her lash out at loved ones. Since seeing her therapist and working with Steel Smiling she now knows how to manage stress better. If she feels anxious or angry, she starts singing or slowly counts in her head until it passes. And, she’s also become a mental health advocate in her community. That’s one of the goals of Beams to Bridges: To end stigma around mental health in the Black community and bolster community support.

Shanell Ware felt angry from a lot of the trauma she faced in her life. But her therapist helped her develop coping mechanisms and she's even shared some of her stories with other people. Courtesy Shanell Ware

“They are making referrals and connecting their friends and families and really being mental health champions,” Julius Boatwright, CEO of Steel Smiling, told TODAY. “They are mental health support in action.”

Steel Smiling offers a Black Mental Health Fund that's available nationwide to defray treatment costs. Requests quickly came in for help.

""People do need support,"" Boatwright said. ""What we would love to see is Black people all across the country being community mental health ... champions. And this is supporting more traditional mental health (professionals).""

Plummer says Steel Smiling, which she works with, help Black people access services they need.

“The community-based companies are doing all the legwork that needs to get done in order to bring people into counseling,” she said. “They get people relaxed so that they can come into counseling.”

Steel Smiling also introduces Black people to therapists who look like them and coaches them on interviewing therapists.

Nationally, Therapy for Black Girls provides a database of more than 1,000 providers so that Black women can find Black therapists.

“There are certain things that you can likely talk with a Black woman therapist about as another Black woman that you won't have to explain twice,” Harden Bradford explained. “There are sadly micro-aggressions that exists even in the therapy space.”

Another national organization, The Loveland Foundation, provides support to Black girls and women to attend therapy. Its therapy fund allows them four to eight therapy sessions with culturally competent providers across the country and partners with Therapy for Black Girls among others. Actress Taraji P. Henson also started the Boris L. Henson Foundation, which aims to destigmatize mental health in the African American community and provide scholarships to Black people pursuing mental health careers. It's currently raising money to offer up to five virtual therapy sessions at a lower cost for people undergoing additional stress during these unprecedented times.

Harden Bradford also hosts a podcast about mental health. Not every episode focuses on illness or trauma — some examine mental health in pop culture — but other address complex issues, such as postpartum depression, self-care after sexual assault and recovering from an abortion, to name a few. She’s learned that the podcast had an impact that she never anticipated.

“People will use episodes of the podcast as a lead in for some difficult conversations,” she said. “If you don't necessarily have the language (around mental health) it could be that you share the podcast episode and ... have a conversation.”

308,How this Black doctor is exposing the racist history of gynecology,"There's one name Dr. Kameelah Phillips, an OB-GYN at Calla Women's Health in New York City, would prefer not to use in her operating room: Sims.

Depending on the context, the word can mean either a surgical tool, ""Sims' vaginal speculum,"" or its inventor, Dr. James Marion Sims. Sims is known as the founding father of gynecology, but his legacy is fraught because of how he gathered much of his learnings — by operating on enslaved Black women without their consent or anesthesia.

Today, Phillips is ""reclaiming"" this story, she told TODAY. She prefers to call the tool ""Lucy.""

Lucy was an enslaved 18-year-old who almost died after Sims operated on her, attempting to fix her postpartum urinary incontinence, according to the Journal of the National Medical Association.

Phillips recalled feeling ""shocked, appalled and disappointed,"" when she first learned about Sims' history over 10 years ago. In that moment, she said it was ""a no-brainer"" to stop using his name.

Dr. Kameelah Philipps refers to the Sims' surgical speculum as ""Lucy,"" after an enslaved woman Dr. J. Marion Sims experimented on. provided

""(Sims) wasn’t going to hold space in my (operating room),"" she said. ""His instrument ... was developed off the pain of women who looked like me.""

The disturbing history of Dr. J. Marion Sims

In 2017, the name ""J. Marion Sims"" made headlines when someone spray-painted the word ""racist"" on his statue in New York City's Central Park, amid nationwide calls to remove monuments to people with ties to the Confederacy.

The following spring, city officials took down Sims' statue. Shortly after, Sims' name fell out of the national conversation and was again relegated to medical textbooks and classrooms, where his story is rarely told in full.

""Lots of people don’t know about it, but (that's) not a mistake,"" Phillips explained. ""When people of color and women have our stories selectively removed from history books, why would I expect people to know about it?""

Renaming the Sims' speculum

In recent weeks, multiple online petitions have been launched to rename medical devices named after Sims; so far, at least 10,000 people have signed them.

Phillips has been calling the device ""Lucy"" for over a decade, but occasionally she needs to tell a new surgical tech what ""Lucy"" refers to, and a history lesson usually follows.

""It’s an opportunity for education and enlightenment,"" she said. ""Most of us throughout the day don’t think about these names, the things (Sims) has done, what he represents.""

Lucy is one of three women who Sims experimented on whose names we know. The others are Anarcha and Betsey, but there are at least a dozen more, Bettina Judd, Ph.D., assistant professor at University of Washington, who wrote a book on the history of medical experimentation on Black women, told TODAY.

In addition to creating an early version of the speculum, Sims is credited with the current procedure to repair vesicovaginal fistulas, a postpartum condition where urine leaks through the vagina. To gather this knowledge, he'd operate upwards of 20 times on a single patient, who'd be on all fours, Judd said.

Some of Sims' supporters say the women were in extreme pain and wanted the procedures. But Judd disagreed with this justification, explaining that the enslaved women didn't have the option to say no.

Others insist Sims was a product of his time, to which Judd answered, ""Whose time are we imagining when we say that? We’re imagining that time depends on racist, white men. We’re imagining that slaves didn’t think it was wrong they were enslaved. Even among his peers, there were plenty of dissenters.""

""Sims understood enslaved women not to have the same pain threshold as white women,"" Judd continued. ""Through his texts and medical practice, you can see how he enacted that, (conducting) these horrendous experiments on Black women.""

Sims also experimented on enslaved infants, according to medical journal Social History of Medicine. Searching for a cure for neonatal tetanus, he thought the baby's skull shape could be the cause, so he used an awl (a pointed tool for piercing holes) to forcibly align the bones. The procedure was fatal.

Sims' legacy now

According to Judd, Sims' legacy continues not just through instruments and procedures, but biases still held by medical professionals.

For example, research from 2016 found that medical students and residents held ""false beliefs about biological differences between Blacks and whites,"" which ""predict racial bias in pain perception and treatment recommendation accuracy,"" the study stated.

As Judd explained it, ""The belief that Black folks, particularly Black women, are ... impervious to pain has a history. We're not just making it up.""

Other data highlights the apparent effects of such beliefs: NBC News reported in January that Black mothers are 2.5 times more likely to die in childbirth than whites. Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released June 24 found that Black people represented 1 in 4 COVID-19 deaths, despite comprising 13% of the population.

Charles Johnson, a father of two, whose wife died after giving birth to their second child, told TODAY he thinks about Sims often. Kira Johnson, a 39-year-old Black woman, underwent a routine cesarean section in April 2016 and died several hours later of a postpartum, internal hemorrhage.

""When I found out about Dr. Sims, I was blown away that the ripples of his work are still so present in modern-day obstetrics,"" Johnson, who lives with his young boys in Atlanta, Georgia, said. ""I refuse to believe that, had (Kira) been caucasian, that this would've happened.""

Johnson's since created 4Kira4Moms, a foundation advocating for stronger maternal health regulations. He also believes telling Sims' full story is crucial to protect Black moms — but it's only ""the first step,"" he said.

How to create change in health care practices

Johnson, Judd and Phillips all proposed changing how medical schools educate students about racial bias as one strategy to achieve more equal health care outcomes.

""We need to teach these things about the history of the American medical profession and how it can have catastrophic effects. It has to be mandatory,"" Johnson said. ""You have to teach specific stories. It needs to be more than data. It needs to be real.""

Since the death of George Floyd, people are once more rejecting honoring Sims' legacy. The president of University of South Carolina, in Sims' home state, supports renaming a women's dorm called Sims. A recent petition demanded the removal of Sims' statue at the state capitol in Alabama, where he practiced.

Phillips said she's ""extremely humbled and proud"" of what's happening as more people learn about Lucy, Anarcha and Betsey.

""For me to be an African American, female physician ... I don't take it lightly that I'm now in a position to tell their stories that they weren't able to tell (because) they had no voice,"" she said.

This was updated on June 30, 2020, to reflect current petitions to rename medical devices named after Sims.",0
309,4 things Black dietitians want you to know about nutrition and wellness,"A registered dietitian is a trained expert who helps people tailor the science of nutrition into useful solutions for healthier living — whether that’s losing weight or managing a specific health condition. But less than 3% of registered dietitians are Black — and just over 80% are white, which means that most of the nutrition information that gets disseminated across mainstream and social media comes from white practitioners. For the most part, this advice doesn’t take into account cultural differences or social conditions that affect a person’s health status.

Here’s what four Black dietitians want you to know about how these disparities are affecting the way we all view nutrition, why it really matters and what needs to change.

1. It’s not our fault.

There’s an idea that Black people are to blame for the health problems they experience, Maya Feller, a registered dietitian in Brooklyn, told TODAY. “I recently had someone tell me that Black people need to take responsibility for their health and eat vegetables,” she said. “It's important for us to understand that Americans across the board are not meeting the recommended intakes for vegetables — not just Black people. Yet, we continue to be told that it's our fault when the country at large is deficient.”

Valerie Agyeman, a women’s health dietitian and founder of Flourish Heights, shared a similar observation. “Research often suggests that there are higher rates of diabetes, hypertension and heart disease in Black people,” she said, “and the sad truth is that they get blamed for it when in all actuality the health outcomes Black people face are linked to social determinants like socioeconomic status, employment, access to budget-friendly nutritious foods, health care and much more.”

In other words, it’s not a lack of willpower or a refusal to try; the real problem is that implicit biases (unconscious race-based stereotypes) in our health and social systems create health disparities and put Black people at higher risk of diseases. As Marisa Moore, a culinary and integrative dietitian in Atlanta, pointed out: “It would be a mistake to judge a person based on your own personal situation without fully understanding all that goes into the food choices and health status of Black people.”

2. The system needs work.

The ability to attain good health in the first place depends on a multitude of factors. Some of the factors that can make or break your health and well-being are:

Neighborhoods that have low crime rates, as well as parks, playgrounds, bike paths and sidewalks where you can safely stay active.

The availability of full-service grocery stores that are stocked with healthful and reasonably-priced foods.

Access to health services for screenings and interventions.

Well-funded public schools and employment opportunities that provide economic stability.

“Our communities tend to not only have fewer full-service grocery stores, more liquor stores and fast food outlets,” said Feller, “but we also have fewer safe spaces to engage in intentional physical activity. We have limited access to higher quality healthcare. We are over-policed and violently punished at astonishing rates. We have lower incomes — and tend to live in underperforming school districts.” Feller explained that when it comes to nutrition, health and dietitian advice, Black people aren’t just significantly disadvantaged, they’re literally being left behind. She noted that environmental conditions like these exacerbate high rates of chronic illnesses, driving 80% of health outcomes, and that it’s a vicious cycle. “Being trapped within a cycle increases the likelihood that the next generation will face the same roadblocks,” she said.

It’s inappropriate to talk about health problems in Black communities without mentioning these social and environmental problems. “Our language is the biggest issue here,” said Vanessa Rissetto, a registered dietitian at Culina Health in Hoboken, New Jersey. She explained that when we say things like Black people have a propensity towards obesity, we make it sound as though by being Black, you are going to be obese. “We leave out the social issues, such as Black people have lack of access, they are not treated the same way whites are when they see practitioners, perhaps there are language barriers or financial issues,” she said. When we talk about health, we have to add this context.

3. There’s a narrow view of healthy eating.

Google healthy eating and you’ll see pages of images with veggies — mostly salads — being prepped or eaten by white people. On Instagram, the hashtag balanced diet looks similar, with a few smoothie and grain bowls thrown in. Is that what it means to eat healthfully? Black dietitians say no, and they challenge you to think more broadly about what to eat to be healthy.

“When we see images of healthy people, they’re exercising and eating a salad. This reinforces the idea that being healthy looks a specific way and is mostly for white people,” said Feller. Moore added that cultural foods are often demonized. “The truth is our traditional foods are actually quite healthy,” she said. “Greens, okra, sweet potatoes are just a few — and we also have to respect that food and culture are connected.""

Additionally, Moore indicated that our narrow view of healthy eating excludes many in the Black, indigenous and people of color (BIPOC) community. “If people are made to think they have to change to only eating brown rice, fresh and organic fruits and vegetables, drinking matcha lattes and going on exotic retreats to be healthy, while their greens and beans cooked with meat are labeled ‘bad,’ then healthy eating may seem inaccessible,” she said. “Giving up your cultural foods is not a prerequisite for health.”

Feller added that “when we begin to see images of people eating curries, dhals, tamales, pasteles, peas and rice, escovitch fish, soups and more, we will see that there are multiple ways to eat healthfully and that there are so many different faces and bodies that represent health.”

4. We need more diversity in the wellness space.

One of the biggest problems, said Feller, is that the media projects a one-size perspective. “The ideal body tends to be that of white, cis-gendered, able-bodied, thin and/or chiseled people,” she said.

Agyeman shared a similar viewpoint. “There is a lack of imagery in skin complexion, body shapes and even hair textures,” she said, adding that it’s critical for mainstream media to put more BIPOC at the forefront of wellness. “Healthy eating belongs to everyone — it is not one-sided.”",0
310,What is racial trauma? How Black therapists are helping patients cope,"Last March, as businesses across the country closed and the death rate from the new coronavirus climbed into the thousands, Dr. Jennifer Mullan, a psychologist in New Jersey, suddenly found herself busier than usual.

""I was working triple time,"" she said. ""I was inundated with calls from people I usually see on a weekly basis saying they needed to be seen immediately.""

Her clients in New York City who don't have washers and dryers in their apartments were panicking because laundromats in the city had closed. Others were worried because they had been showing symptoms of the virus but were turned away when they sought help at doctor's offices.

Then, in May, George Floyd was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis, launching weeks of protests against police brutality and racial injustice — and, for many Black Americans, bringing to the surface decades of racial trauma. Once again, Mullan's workload skyrocketed.

Many clients were bringing up the videos of police brutality they had watched on the news and on social media. The videos alone can be triggers, she said.

""Witnessing George Floyd screaming for his mother — that in itself can be extremely traumatic for many Black-identifying Americans, because many people are saying, that could be my son, that could be my father,"" Mullan said.

""A lot of individuals I'm working with right now are feeling absolutely exhausted and burnt out, and consistently feeling like it is unsafe to leave the house,"" she added. ""Breonna Taylor was murdered in her bed. That is bringing trauma. People don't feel safe in their homes. There is that constant feeling of, could I be next?""

Dr. Richard Orbe-Austin, a psychologist in New York, said he too heard about the police killings from his clients.

“It is something that has been indeed very triggering,” he said. “Some of my clients have talked about the pain of seeing (those killings) and how it triggered particular feelings of anxiety and fear, or their own experiences of being stopped by the police.”

What is racial trauma?

Racial trauma is the cumulative effect of racism on someone's mental and physical health.

That includes direct acts of racism such as hate crimes or being discriminated against at work; systemic racism, which includes health disparities, pay inequity, lack of diversity and more; as well as microaggressions, which are more subtle acts of racism in the form of comments or questions that often perpetuate racial stereotypes.

Add all that to the recent police killings as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affects African American communities, and therapists aren't surprised that this moment in time is having a profound psychological effect on their Black patients.

What does racial trauma look like?

Racial trauma looks a lot like post-traumatic stress disorder, therapists said.

""The symptoms of PTSD are similar to how the trauma of racism shows up in people,"" said Brittney R. Cobb, a licensed clinical social worker in North Carolina, who runs the Instagram account @ablackfemaletherapist.

That means irritability, low self-esteem, poor concentration, feelings of hopelessness, fatigue, anxiety and depression. And that psychological stress in turn can lead to physical health problems — hypertension, heart attacks, diabetes and obesity, for example, which are all disorders that disproportionately affect Black people.

Part of what therapists are doing is helping patients simply identify their own racial trauma and where it comes from.

“I think a lot of people might not understand that this is part of a larger system of systematic oppression,” Mullan said. “I really take time to break things down in tangible ways and say, ‘This is what historical trauma means.’”",0
311,How to find a gynecologist or pediatrician — as a Black woman,"As a mom, dietitian and Black woman living in the United States, I am acutely aware of the pervasive race-related bias in health care that places my children and me in harm’s way. Being Black while seeking out empathic, equitable and unbiased medical care takes attention — and intention.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the maternal mortality rate in the U.S. for 2018 was 17.4 per 100,000 live births. Black women fare much worse: the rate skyrockets to 37.1 deaths per 100,000 live births. Breast cancer death rates are also 40% higher for Black women compared with their white counterparts. “Black women are dying four to five times the rate of anyone (else) in this country,” said Tracie Collins, the CEO and founder of the National Black Doulas Association (NBDA) based in Suwanee, Georgia. “The odds are stacked against us. The question is, where are you going to fall?”

There are a number of reasons for these horrific outcomes. Black women have inadequate access to high-quality health care. They’re less likely to be routinely monitored and more likely to receive delayed diagnoses and treatment, as well as subpar care, according to researchers at organizations like the National Research Council. Simply put, racism in health care puts Black women’s lives at risk. There have been innumerable accounts where Black women, including celebrities, have cited racism and bias in health care. Articles have been written substantiating these experiences — and providers within the health care community have called this out as a public health crisis.

Even as a young, well-educated Black woman, I am no exception to this. My first pregnancy took an unexpected turn. Midway through, I began experiencing significant pain and immediately went in for an appointment. I was told that the fibroid I had was decompensating and that it “might hurt,” then was sent home with pain medication. Within 24 hours, the pain transitioned to early labor. I was under the care of one of the most progressive and highly skilled obstetricians in New York City, yet my pregnancy ended with the death of my first child.

My treatment and care weren’t intentionally biased, I believe I was just seen as a first-time Black mom who was strong. The stereotype and cultural construct of “the strong Black woman” has detrimental ramifications. Additionally, implicit bias (a type of prejudice in which racial stereotypes are formed without conscious intention) allowed my care provider to discount my pain. On some level, I too had internalized the bias in the air and thought I could manage. I’ve talked to a number of white friends who’ve had similar experiences with different outcomes. The major difference? When they reported pain during pregnancy, most were admitted for further observation — and not sent home.

How can Black women get the OB/GYN care they need?

The NBDA’s Collins strongly recommends that Black women become drivers of their own health care. This includes researching care providers and knowing how to ask questions and get evidence-based responses. It involves understanding how to demand further medical support when a treatment or intervention is necessary. Collins also suggests that all patients document interactions with medical staff and care providers.

When looking for a new health care provider, Collins noted how important it is to understand your insurance coverage and whether (or to what extent) it’s accepted at the provider’s practice. “I would go even further to understand and know statistics within the facility and with providers,” she said.

Mya Walker, a mom from Brooklyn, said she prefers to seek out Black women for her OB/GYN care. “I feel that I want someone that I can really talk to, and more importantly, have someone who I feel may be more predispositioned to care about me or even just relate to any issue I may talk about.” She said that in her previous interactions with white male doctors, they were quick to categorize her and offer a generic treatment. I’ve heard many of my Black women friends express this concern before.

Black women are entitled to health care providers who will listen to them and assure them that their concerns are being heard — providers who will respond with care, compassion and evidence-based advice specific to their health needs and the needs of their family.

“From a clinical perspective, the number one criterion for any medical provider is, do they listen? And are they hearing you?” said Juliette Blount, a nurse practitioner and health equity speaker based in New York City. And by listening, Blount added, “are they listening and nodding, but in their head, they have already decided what they will prescribe?” Or is the provider actively listening and truly hearing the patient. “If they are hearing,” said Blount, “they should be asking questions and seeking clarification based on the listening that they’re doing. You (the patient) should feel relieved versus frustrated at the end of the interaction.”

How to make sure you’re really being heard

Whether or not we’re really being heard by our health care providers is one of the common themes that comes up in our community time and again. Simone Toomer, a Brooklyn-based certified doula and mom of two children, stressed the importance of seeking out individualized care and questioning: “Are (you) being heard — and listened to? Are questions being answered and not brushed off? Is evidence-based care (being) given?”

Toomer emphasized that providers should be referring Black women and their family members to specialists when needed. Patients also need to advocate for themselves, she said. “If, for whatever reason, you feel unheard or disrespected, especially in the Black community, we don’t have to make excuses for that treatment and can change OBs, midwives and pediatricians at any point.” When preparing to switch providers, Toomer said it’s important to request that copies of all medical records be forwarded to the new provider. Additionally, she noted that it may be challenging to change obstetricians after, say, 20 weeks of gestation, and the switch could result in increased out of pocket costs.

I personally gravitate toward health care providers who listen and ask questions when I describe an ailment or express a concern about one of my children. I am most comfortable with providers who are partners in my care, rather than ones who blindly diagnose and prescribe. I look for practitioners who know their craft well and understand when to refer out — and who are thoughtful and practice with humility.

For some, however, self-advocacy may be difficult, especially after repeated experiences of being marginalized. “I would encourage folks to harness their ego strengths and search (for providers) with the feeling that you are in charge of the course of your health,” said Nardia Brooks, a psychotherapist who serves mostly people of color in the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn. When choosing an OB/GYN or pediatrician, Brooks said, “I would encourage strong advocacy for (your)self and (the) unborn child. Read, get your facts straight, have questions ready, interview as many OB/GYNs as your insurance, time and body allow. It’s your body, your child, your course.”

Taking the time and effort to find a provider that is in line with your values and one that you feel good about is well worth the effort.",0
312,Why racism can have long-term effects on children's health,"Dr. Nia Heard-Garris was startled when her 4-year-old son came home from preschool one day and declared, “Mommy, sometimes I’m white.”

As a pediatrician who studies the impact of racism on children’s health and the mother of a Black boy with caramel skin, she carefully inquired further. He told her one of his friends said he only played with white kids.

“He just told the boy, ‘OK, I’m white today then.’ This kid was fine with that answer and let him play,” Heard-Garris, a pediatrics researcher at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, told TODAY.

“My No. 1 job as his parent is to keep him safe and try to help protect him from some of those things. However, the world is the world and I wasn’t expecting at 4, he would have to start to navigate these experiences.”

As kids get older, these experiences get more intense, said Heard-Garris, who wrote about the incident in JAMA Pediatrics. They may also do real damage.

Racism is a core social determinant of health that has a profound impact on the health of children, adolescents, young adults and their families, the American Academy of Pediatrics said in its first policy statement on the subject, issued in 2019 and citing 180 studies and papers.

“Racism harms children’s health, starting from before they are born,"" said Dr. Sally Goza, the AAP’s president, in June.

Toxic stress

Researchers studying the impact said it affects kids’ physical health, mental health and development.

When children are targets of racism, they experience chronic stress and are flooded with stress hormones like cortisol, leading to inflammatory reactions, noted Dr. Maria Trent, coauthor of AAP’s policy statement and a pediatrics professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore.

This can harm kids’ health in the short term, “but also may create long-term problems like heart disease, diabetes and depression,” Trent wrote in an essay for Children’s Rights.

The mental health aspects of racism on children’s health may be better known, Heard-Garris said. That includes the impact of bias kids experience directly or second-hand — perhaps witnessing their parents being the targets — and the effects of both are similar, she noted.

Children’s exposure to discrimination was linked with higher rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, and decreased general health in a 2017 study.

It could lead to behavioral issues such as aggression and hostility, but also being withdrawn and feeling socially isolated, Heard-Garris said.

“The self-esteem is a part of it, and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness. Those tend to come out especially around events like we’re seeing now — feeling like the weight of the world is on your shoulders,” she noted.

Kids tell her, “Sometimes it feels like nothing will change. Sometimes it feels so big.”

Mistrust of health care system

There’s also the issue of unconscious bias in the health care system, which often unknowingly interacts with people of color differently than with other patients, said Dr. Ray Bignall, a pediatric nephrologist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.

He’s particularly concerned about how doctors and other health professionals interface with children in ways that are overtly or covertly racist, which leads to mistrust and delay in treatment. That, in turn, can lead to worse health outcomes for minority kids.

“There are many families who are very hesitant and skeptical of accessing pediatric care,” Bignall said.

“Every African-American person in the U.S., I would venture to guess, so many of us have a story about how the medical system didn’t listen to us or our family member.”

He recalled getting involved in the case of a Black boy with kidney disease whose chart contained complaints about his family not following through on doctors’ recommendations. Bignall’s white colleague had initially provided care, and when Bignall talked to the boy’s mother during a follow-up visit, she told him she almost didn’t come because the other doctor essentially threatened to call child protective services if she didn’t follow the care recommendations more consistently.

When Bignall asked his colleague about it, “the comment he made to me was, ‘I know that I can talk with them this way because we have such a good rapport that I feel like I could kind of light a fire underneath her to look after her kid better,’” Bignall recalled.

“It was such a striking dichotomy from the experience she had shared with me. It really underscores the challenge that a lot of Black patients have.”

Bignall didn’t know whether the other doctor would have said the same thing to a white family, but in his experience, there’s a different threshold for being proscriptive and less collaborative when dealing with ethnic minority families and those who come from a background of social disadvantage, he said.

When Bignall took over the boy’s care, he found out his father had recently died and the family didn’t have heat in their home in the middle of winter. The label “difficult family” in a child’s chart is sometimes a code word for a family that’s stressed out and struggling even before it has to deal with a sick kid, he said.

Other trends in Bignall’s medical field concern him as well. Black kids are disproportionately more likely to be born premature, which predisposes them to kidney disease, he said. A gene variant found in African-Americans may also play a role.

But if Black kids need specialist care or a kidney transplant, they’re referred for it later in the course of illness than other kids, he noted. “Is this because of physician bias? Or (patient) distrust of the medical system? We need to learn more,” Bignall noted. The delay means kids need dialysis sooner, exposing them to the increased morbidity associated with it.

Black children also wait longer to get a donor kidney and then when they do get it, it fails sooner, he said.

Long-lasting effects

Racism is a “socially transmitted disease,” the AAP policy statement noted. Teachers treating minority children differently and guidance counselors telling them they shouldn’t think about college — ""all of those things are still happening,"" which leads to those kids not feeling like they’re smart enough, Heard-Garris said.

The health impacts of racism in childhood are extremely long-lasting, added Dr. Monique Jindal, an internal medicine-pediatrics physician at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution.

“When we talk to adults about their experiences of racism, the number of times an adult will bring up an experience from childhood is so common, which just shows you how these experiences stick with you,” Jindal said.

She recalled watching Black kids wait in the emergency room of a hospital and be treated as if they don’t belong there. She said children tell her about hearing disparaging names and comments at school.

“(When) you’re constantly being told you’re not good enough and not valued, there’s this constant internalized racism where you start to believe these things that people say about you. It affects how a child develops their own identity,” Jindal said.

Every African-American person in the U.S., I would venture to guess, so many of us have a story about how the medical system didn’t listen to us or our family member. Dr. Ray Bignall, pediatric nephrologist at Nationwide Children

“They can internalize it. But then also we’ve seen it can affect what a kid believes they’re capable of doing.”

She recalled treating a 13-year old Black boy who had been assaulted in his neighborhood. After a week in the hospital, he returned because he wasn’t feeling well. Jindal thought it was related to his initial injury, but it turned out he had so much anxiety about what had happened to him that he developed chest pain.

“I asked him, ‘Do you feel safe? How are you feeling?’ And he said, ‘Nobody in the hospital ever asked me that,’” she recalled. “Nobody asked him if he was OK, what his plans were, if he was going to be safe when he went home.”

What can be done:

All of the experts were hopeful this moment in time was an opportunity for change since people are paying attention to the issue.

There are ways for parents and pediatricians to play an important role. Babies as young as 3 months old can notice the difference in skin color; at age 5, children start to know what’s fair and unfair; and by 12, some children even become set in their beliefs, Jindal said. That’s why it’s important to talk about race with kids.

“Kids are soaking up everything that’s around them and that includes these experiences of racism,” she noted. “Ask them questions, what they do and don’t notice, what they think about that. Kids are very honest creatures, they’ll tell you almost anything.”

“It’s important to talk about differences in race, skin color and all those things because kids are seeing them,” added Heard-Garris.

Meanwhile, pediatricians should be sensitive to the racism children experience and create a medical practice where all families feel welcomed, the AAP noted in its recommendations. When kids report experiencing racism, pediatricians should evaluate their mental health, including signs of post-traumatic stress, anxiety, grief and depression.

The health care field should be more diverse, Bignall said. Black people make up about 13% of the U.S. population, but 5% of doctors, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. Latinos make up about 18% of the U.S. population, but less than 6% of physicians.

It means that during training in medical school, residencies and fellowships, there’s a lack of diverse perspectives that allow physicians of other backgrounds to better understand how to take care of minority children, Bignall noted.

“Non-white patients should not require a race-matched provider to receive a standard of care that is equitable and dignified,” wrote Dr. Rhea Boyd, a pediatrician in the San Francisco Bay Area, in The Lancet in 2019.

Bignall and Heard-Garris also supported policy changes addressing everything from inclusion to food and housing insecurity.

“If we put a Band-Aid on a really big problem… then this problem is just going to keep coming up,” Heard-Garris said. “Kids unfortunately will bear the brunt of it.”",0
313,"Brain surgeon: 'If you're Black and a woman, nothing else is visible'","Dr. Odette Harris is director of brain injury care at Stanford Medicine in California. In 2018, she became one of the first Black female professors of neurosurgery in the U.S. Many people believed in her along the way, but she has seen first-hand how race and racism can impact a doctor’s and a patient’s experience. She shared her story with TODAY.

Dr. Odette Harris was born in Jamaica and came to the U.S. as a child. Terrence McCarthy / Stanford University

The first and most powerful person certain of my success was my father. He nicknamed me “Star” as a kid.

I wanted to be many things, including a doctor, as far back as 8th grade, but my love of neuroscience blossomed in college. I had the world’s most amazing mentors. They created for me and allowed the most incredible opportunities to gain access to the field.

My mentors were not diverse — look at our field. Women and African-Americans are woefully underrepresented in the neurosciences. There were not a lot of people on my path who would represent a diversity of backgrounds — races, gender and ethnicity. But it’s testament that someone doesn’t need to look like you or come from the same background as you to be able to add beneficially to your path.

I definitely had naysayers. They come in so many different forms and can be truly detrimental to one’s psyche. The most lingering incidents in my memory came from people who didn’t even know who you were.

My husband jokes that my memoir should be titled, “No, I’m Not From Maryland” because of the number of times when I’ve had the “Odette Harris, MD” name card in a meeting and someone asked, “Oh, are you from Maryland?” Something as absurd as putting the initials of your state next to your name seems more plausible than the fact that “MD” stands for doctor. I can’t even tell you how many people ask that.

One time I was at an all-day meeting. There were only a dozen people at the table and I stood up to take a break at the back of the room. I was stretching my legs and one of the participants came over to ask me if I was going to be setting up for lunch. He truly mistook me for a member of the wait staff. This is somebody who I had been at a table with for five hours in intense discussions. There’s nothing more affirming that you are invisible. I felt immediately demoralized and my contributions felt devalued.

Another time, I was the keynote speaker and I was outside waiting for my car at valet and a person came up gave me their keys to valet park their car.

Harris' clinical focus is traumatic brain injury. Courtesy Dr. Odette Harris

I was once scrubbing to go into the operating theater before surgery and the guy who was in charge of having people clean the rooms came up to ask me to clean a room. And I just said, “I will when I’m done with this case.”

In my experience, if you’re Black and a woman, nothing else is visible. Not the scrubs, not the suit, not the location, not the name and credentials — none of that matters if you’re blinded by that attribute.

Hospitals tend to be places where people are in existential moments in their lives — you don’t know what patients are carrying on their shoulders — so sometimes in stress, people revert to lesser versions of themselves. But when it comes from colleagues, it’s harder to process that.

Taken aback by loved one’s experience

My father was at a well-known hospital in New York. They saved his life, but I can tell you that race 100% factored into his care. I once got a call from a social worker who described my father as “non-compliant with his medications.” When you use words like that, you paint a picture of the patient that is deleterious to the record and ultimately to the health care that’s rendered.

My father had an attendant so all of his medications were given on schedule and he was not non-compliant. So I challenged her and asked, “What did you base that on?” What came out of the conversation was, “Well, just looking at him, he seems to be someone who wouldn’t be compliant.”

My father needed to be seen by a specialist in follow-up, but he was sent to the general clinic. I called to speak to the social worker to assess why he wouldn’t be seeing the specialist and was told the clinic is for those who are not insured. But my father is dually insured. The signifier of race is so powerful that they don’t even bother to check his insurance status — not that it should matter, by the way.

He was somehow ineligible for the specialty clinic because he was “uninsured” — but he wasn’t uninsured. The assumption was that here’s an elderly Black man who’s been hospitalized who is not compliant, per the chart, so what difference does it make what clinic we put him in? It’s 100% detrimental to his care, 100% detrimental to the care of individuals. I 100% believe it happens constantly. My father didn’t tell people his daughter was a doctor. He was going through these health care scenarios just as a person and the disparity in treatment was extreme.

I’m hopeful about the trajectory of things now only in the sense that I’m an extreme optimist.

From a realist standpoint, I remain concerned. When we’re on the other side of this movement, what are the repercussions, if any? We’ve had women in medical school classes at very high rates and yet we’ve not seen that trickle in terms of leadership — the number of deans, chief operating officers, chairs. We’re not seeing those numbers be representative and that’s just with gender.

But without hope, my life, my path, my journey, my accomplishments would not even exist. Because I had to be able to see what was unseen and I had to be able to hope in what I hadn’t seen before.

314,Pregnant 26-year-old's death sheds light on health care system that fails Black mothers,"It was a day Sha-Asia Washington had looked forward to for the last nine months.

The Brooklyn mother-to-be posed for a photo from her bed at Woodhull Medical Center in New York on July 2. Her face mask was pulled down to her chin so the camera could capture her joyful smile.

Washington, 26, was a few days past her due date when went to the hospital for a routine stress test. After some observation, doctors noticed her blood pressure was high and gave Washington a drug to induce labor. She was asked if she wanted an epidural and after some hesitation, according to her family, she agreed.

Her boyfriend, Juwan Lopez, was on FaceTime with his mother, Desiree Williams, when the situation took a turn for the worse.

""The next thing you know he’s waiting there and they start running her down the hallway to the operating room,” Williams told Rolling Stone. ""He’s just screaming, ‘What happened? What happened?’ And nobody’s answering. Then somebody said the baby’s heart rate started dropping.""

Washington went into cardiac arrest while doctors delivered baby via c-section. Washington was pronounced dead after doctors spent 45 minutes trying to save her with CPR. Her newborn daughter, Khloe, was healthy.

Washington's death is shedding light on the racial disparities Black women face when giving birth.

In 2018, 658 women died of maternal causes in the U.S. A recent study showed Black women had a death rate of 40.8 per 100,000 births, three times higher than the rate of white women. American Indian and Native Alaskan women had the next highest rate at 29.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, more than double the rate in white women.

Experts have cited several reasons for the disparities, including systemic and institutional racism within the healthcare system, underlying health conditions more common in Black mothers and access to prenatal care.

Washington's family is now asking for justice. A GoFundMe page has now raised more than $88,000 to help with funeral costs and to support Lopez, who is now raising Khloe as a single father.

""WOODHULL HOSPITAL KILLED SHAASIA GIVING HER A EPIDURAL PLEASE HELP US GET JUSTICE,"" said a description on the fundraiser page.

It also comes three months after Amber Rose Isaac, 26, died at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx after she tweeted her concerns about the care she had been getting from the hospital.

Amy Schumer is also using her platform to speak out about the cases.

""We need to wake up and do better every day,"" she wrote, alongside gorgeous pregnancy photos Washington and Lopez took together as they eagerly awaited the birth of Khloe.

Washington's family also wants to raise awareness about what happened to her and the other Black women who died in childbirth. Last Thursday, they gathered outside Woodhull Medical Center, where one life was cut short and another had just started, to demand justice. They were joined by friends and a group of New York City doulas.

""She just started her family. Just got her own apartment to be on her own,"" Washington's future sister-in-law, Jasmin Lopez wrote on the fundraiser page. ""If you know Sha-Asia she wanted to be a mom and she was gonna be an amazing one.""",0
315,Anxious about society re-opening? Follow these 5 rules,"A 5-step plan to fight re-entry anxiety

Chapman uses an acronym to break down a set of skills using cognitive behavioral therapy to manage strong emotions through the re-entry process: FIGHT, as in fight COVID-19 anxiety.

F: Focus on what you can control.

While there’s a lot of uncertainty associated with COVID-19, and anxiety and uncertainty go hand in hand, he said, there are actually a number of elements we can control. Those include how much media coverage we allow ourselves to watch and how much we talk about it. We can also control the things we can do in our immediate environment, and we can follow CDC guidelines as it relates to social distancing. This focus will give us a sense of control and predictability, he said, that will help us manage anxiety much more effectively.

I: Identify negative thoughts

While negative thoughts are inevitable right now, those that are catastrophic in nature, or that are predictive — as in ‘this is going to happen to me’ or ‘I know that this won't end anytime soon,’ create intense emotions, Chapman said. An important skill is to identify those negative thoughts and recognize that they contribute to maintaining strong emotions.

G: Generate alternative thoughts

This isn’t about positive thoughts, necessarily, Chapman explained, but coming up with more flexible thoughts. “It's not a ‘you got this, attaboy’ sort of thing. What if you feel like you don’t got this?”

He recommends coming up with what he calls a retrieval cue, something that reminds you to remain in uncomfortable situations. That can be an image or a small statement — Chapman likes to use an anchor. “It's a reminder of being flexible, being present, not escaping, that triggers the brain to recall the right things to do and say in that situation, and helps you remain.”

“I create a hierarchy of social situations that are uncomfortable, identify my thoughts in advance, and then become more flexible in those thoughts,” he explained. That cue “reminds me of anxiety being harmless, of anxiety being adaptive and helpful, and I ride the wave as opposed to fleeing.”

H: Highlight adaptive behaviors

Chapman recommends finding behaviors you can engage in to help navigate strong emotions. That could be exercise, mindfulness, and meditation, or connecting with family and friends even if it’s via technology.

A critical adaptive behavior is anchoring in the present, he said. Say you’re in a crowded subway car and feel anxiety rising, a technique to use in the moment is breathing in through the nose for four seconds and out through the mouth for six. “That stimulates heart lung synchronization, so now you're anchored and grounded in the present moment,’ he said. “And then you do what I call a three point check: What am I thinking right now? What am I feeling in my body right now? What am I doing, or feel like doing right now — and it might be I feel like peacing out and escaping immediately. Well, am I reacting to what's happening right now, or to a future path? The bottom line is, I need to respond to what's happening in the present moment.”

Following the situation, ask yourself what you learned, Chapman said. “Your brain learns a new non-threatening association despite how you feel in that context. So it's not about stress reduction. It's about learning something new, learning that I can tolerate discomfort, learning that this sky isn't actually going to crack and learning that it might be better than I expected it to be.”

T: Teach

Arguably the most important element is to teach someone else to do the same thing, Chapman said. “We're all in this fight together. If we band together and use the same skills and strategies. I think that we will make it through together.”",0
316,Alone time: How to find time alone during quarantine,"For the past two months plus, I’ve been sharing a 1,000 square feet with three other people. Sure, I’m married to one and gave birth to two, but we’re lucky enough to have a couple of doors to close for privacy and as long as we’re all healthy, I really have no complaints. But, like so many with kids at home (or roommates), I miss the uninterrupted time I used to have to think clearly about work and process what’s happening in the world. Heck, I miss time to myself of any kind.

Charlynn Ruan, a clinical psychologist and the CEO of the Thrive Psychology Group in Los Angeles, CA says everyone needs a little time to themselves — even extroverts. “Being constantly surrounded by others can tax our brain and leave us feeling cranky, exhausted, anxious and overwhelmed,” says Ruan. “Our brain needs to filter out the majority of input it takes in during any given moment and focus on what is relevant to us.”

That’s why time to yourself — even just ten minutes — can do wonders for your psychological well-being, says Amy Morin, psychotherapist and the author of “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do.”

“Some time alone every day is definitely good for our mental health. We’re constantly influenced by the people around us. Their opinions and their actions affect us. Without any alone time, you could get caught up in the daily hustle and bustle while losing sight of the bigger picture. We risk losing sight of our own goals or values. It’s important to have some quiet time to think about your needs and the things that are important to you in life.”

Time to yourself also helps you process your thoughts and feelings. “When we are surrounded by people, we have more noise, more movement, more emotions and more situations that require our brain to filter and make decisions about what is important in that moment,” Ruan explains. “When this is ongoing, the system starts to overwhelm and we start to lose focus, struggle with decision making, and feel anxious. She says, silent spaces give our brains a break from filtering out sensory input, like your roommates dishes clanging or the strains of the music from Animal Crossing.

Solitude has many benefits

If you’ve been feeling edgy and snappy in quarantine with a crew, you aren’t alone — it’s just a sign you might need time alone. Morin says solitude builds mental strength, increases productivity, and sparks creativity. “Individuals who are comfortable being by themselves experience greater happiness and more life satisfaction. They’re also less likely to experience depression and are better at managing stress,” she says.

Kids benefit from alone time, too. “Although many parents think that kids are more likely to get in trouble when they have less to do, studies show kids who are comfortable being alone exhibit fewer behavioral problems,” says Morin.

5 ways carve out alone time in a full house

1. Establish some boundaries

Ruan says the first step to gaining more alone time is to have an open conversation about the different needs each person at home has, and how others can respect these needs. “Each person needs to express their needs for solitude before they start to resent the other people in the house who may be unwittingly violating their boundaries,” she says, adding that parents should be mindful of when they might be reaching “the point of overwhelm,” and give themselves a break. “Kids will respect when mommy needs a time-out,” she says. “They understand what it feels like to get overwhelmed by their reactions and emotions and it takes the shame off of them for also needing time to calm down.”

To help kids understand that boundary, Morin recommends giving them an activity to keep busy while setting a timer to give them an auditory cue that signals when your alone time is up. “Explain they should knock on your door or yell in the event of an emergency, but make it clear that being annoyed by your brother or wanting a refill on your snack isn’t an emergency,” she suggests.

2. Make a plan

Work with your housemates to establish a solo time schedule, while being flexible and communicative about changing needs. “As this quarantine drags on, needs change,” Ruan says. “Create an agreement with your housemates that all needs will be honored, needs can be changed and the default attitude will be grace and acceptance.”

3. Be an early bird

Morin says waking up before everyone else in the household is a great way to carve out a few extra minutes to yourself. “Drinking a cup of coffee in silence might be all you need to start your day out well,” she says. In roommate households, or homes with older children, Ruan also recommends taking advantage of differing sleep schedules to sneak in some solo time. “Encourage each person to figure out their most restorative alone time routine and start using this daily time when others in the house are asleep to have silence,” she says.

4. Parent in shifts

Coupled families with kids can carve out childcare shifts to give each other the alone time they need to get work done, or just regroup, suggests Ruan. “Couples who are used to spending weekends together as a family because they are at work all week might feel like this means they don't like spending time together, but in reality, they need this intentional time apart to make up for all the time apart they used to have going out into the world for work, errands and other activities we can't do right now,” she says.

5. Take a walk

Morin says spending time in nature by yourself can be especially good for mental health. Studies show walking in nature has a restorative effect on cortisol levels — cortisol is the hormone produced by stress. What’s more, Stanford University researchers found a 90 minute walk in nature might reduce rumination, or negative self-referential thought patterns associated with a heightened risk for depression and other mental illnesses.

When you finally get time some alone, drop your to-do lists and do something restorative instead, suggests Ruan. “Time alone can help you be more focused and less reactive, especially if you spend it on restorative activities like journaling, exercise, yoga or meditation. Resist the urge to use the time to clean or catch up on their to-do list and instead use this time as the self-care luxury it is,” she says.",0
317,"Exhausted, tired and unfocused while you're working from home?","I should be nailing this working-from-home thing these days. I’ve been based in a home office for years, so I’m not adjusting to Zoom meetings or missing my colleagues. My kids are self-sufficient. I’m not sick or caring for anyone who’s sick. With gyms and restaurants closed and travel restricted, I have lots of free time. I feel like I should be getting so much done.

But I’m not. I’m distracted and fighting to concentrate. I’m in bed a little longer every night, but I’m not sleeping as well. I’m spending more time than ever scrolling through Facebook, Instagram and Medium. It feels like an accomplishment to play Words With Friends.

Turns out, I’m not the only one struggling. “We’re feeling less productive and more fatigued because we are not equipped for this,” says Melanie Ross Mills, a family relationship expert in Dallas.

We’re not in February anymore

Many of us ‘check out’ in response to trauma, and we’re all facing trauma these days. “We can’t accomplish what we could have been able to do last February. Our continuity is lost and we’re feeling highly distracted,” says Mills. “For comfort, we binge — on Netflix, on that extra bag of Doritos, on a glass of rosé — and that contributes to our inability to focus.”

Even those of us who are used to working from home are not used to COVID-19. “We are facing a very real threat, and a physiological response is inevitable,” says Beth Darnall, associate professor and psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine.

In the face of this threat, our nervous systems can shift into high alert. Our heart rates and respiration rates can climb. We might have anxious thoughts. Our cortisol and adrenaline levels can increase. “All of this is physically fatiguing,” Darnall says. “And mentally, it’s difficult to concentrate on work details when you’re reading about people dying.”

The uncertainty these days also adds to our struggles. “People want to feel in control over their lives,” says Ashley Baldwin, a licensed professional counselor in Emmaus, Penn. “We feel powerless over this pandemic. It’s leaving people feeling stressed out, depressed, and anxious.”

Creating a sense of safety and stability can help minimize the negative effects of living through a pandemic. Here are eight things we can try:

1. Maintain a “new normal” routine

Even when we’re staying home, we can shower, dress, eat, sleep, work, and practice self-care on a regular timetable. “In a normal life schedule, we have biorhythms that offer us cues that are grounding and stabilizing,” Darnall says. “As much as possible we want to maintain those natural biorhythms.”

2. Give yourself grace

Many of us expect ourselves to perform at pre-pandemic levels. “Have compassion. Assure yourself that nobody is performing at their peak right now,” Darnall says.

Mills agrees. “It’s really important to give ourselves permission to let go — to accept the fact it’s not like it was in February,” she says. “We can be so hard on ourselves when we’re not who we used to be and not functioning the way we know.”

3. Find a substitute for your commute

Look for a new ritual to help you transition from work time to home time. “Sometimes we just need to decompress on our way home from work, and we aren’t given the time to do that now,” Baldwin says.

4. Limit your news consumption

“If we all take stock of the amount of time we have been spending engaging in the news, it’s probably a fairly low return on investment,” Darnell says. She recommends taking a news vacation for a day or two — did it change how you felt or how you slept, or allow you to focus on things that are under your control?

5. Try techniques that promote peaceful feelings

To calm our nervous systems and ground and center ourselves we can try guided relaxation audio files, diaphragmatic breathing, or meditation. “These can counteract the effects of stress and deregulation,” Darnall says. “We’re essentially training ourselves toward stability.”

6. Acknowledge your increased demands

Even something as simple as picking up groceries for a neighbor adds to our stress these days. And many of us are facing much greater demands, like homeschooling, caring for sick loved ones, and managing a household where everyone is home all the time. The simple act of recognizing these additional responsibilities can make it easier to cope.

7. Do the things you already know you should

All of the tried-and-true self-care strategies are even more important now — eat right, take breaks, exercise and spend time outside (responsibly).

8. Practice gratitude, especially now

“Gratitude for me unlocks everything. It’s paramount,” Mills says. “Ask yourself, ‘In what ways are you seeing life transformed for the better? How are you becoming a better person?’”",0
318,9 tips to deal with the uncertainty of the coronavirus outbreak,"A few months ago, very few of us could've imagined a world in which eating dinner outside our homes or hugging a close friend would feel like a luxury from a past life. The changes we've seen in the last weeks would've been unthinkable.

The times we're living in now are also likely taking a toll on all of us, says Robin Stern, a psychologist and the associate director of the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence. ""We're all anxious about the news, stressed and stretched from dealing with the day-to-day disruption.""

It's not just the grave news reports we're getting, says Stern. We can't engage in the usual routines that help us cope, like working out at the gym, meeting up with a friend for coffee or even our morning commute. It's natural that we're going to be more irritable, less patient and less calm, she says. The disruption and uncertainty is affecting nearly every aspect of our lives.

Uncertainty can trigger a fear response — and the stakes are high right now

What we're experiencing as a result of the pandemic is unprecedented in many ways, including the amount of uncertainty we're all facing. Uncertainty is particularly difficult to deal with because it triggers fear, says Neda Gould, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences and director of the mindfulness program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""We view uncertainty as a potential threat to our well-being.""

Right now, the stakes feel really high, says Gould. We don't know how the virus might physically affect us or our loved ones, how our work and ability to provide for ourselves and our families might be affected or when we'll be able to eat, move and socialize again in the ways we like. ""There's uncertainty on many levels,"" she says.

In general, if the stakes are higher, the threat feels higher, Gould explains. For example, let's say you're waiting to hear whether you're going to be offered a job you really want. The uncertainty around the prospect of not getting the job is a ""threat"" to your potential livelihood and professional happiness. By contrast, if the stakes are lower, the threat feels lower. If, for instance, a friend doesn't immediately respond to your phone call, the ""threat"" of not being able to chat isn't such a big deal.

Gould points out that it's the small routines in our daily lives — walking the dog, riding the train to work, picking up the dry cleaning — that help create a sense of normalcy. And often when there are larger global or societal stressors, it's these daily routines that help us ""escape"" those more ominous concerns and feel comforted. But she warns, ""This is not the case with the coronavirus pandemic — where even our daily activities are significantly impacted.""

It's not just you — none of us do well with this much uncertainty

Whether deciding when to cross a busy street, whether to buy or not buy a house or which college to attend, we all need a reasonable degree of certainty to act, explains Arie Kruglanski, a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland. ""When uncertainty strikes, especially concerning many of people's life's domains, people experience angst.""

Kruglanski's work over the past several decades has investigated why some of us react to uncertainty with more intensity than others. Part of the answer, he says, is determined by the individual's need for cognitive closure, which simply put, is ""the need for certainty."" It's also a matter of how important or trivial the uncertainty is.

It's not surprising that right now, the amount of uncertainty we're facing is troublesome to us all, he says. ""Uncertainty that is coupled with mortal danger, such as the current pandemic, is unlikely to be welcomed even by people with a low degree of the need for closure.""

How to better manage when the world has been turned upside down

There are a number of healthy coping strategies you can use to manage stress and anxiety during the pandemic. Here's what the experts say will help.

1. Start with you

Self-care has never been more important, says Stern. When everyone around you is anxious and on edge, the best way to stay healthy and help those in need around you is by taking care of yourself. Get sleep, eat well and engage in some kind of movement every day. Do the things that will help you stay calm and centered. Those steps are the priority right now.

2. Don't judge your anxieties — or those of the people around you

Go easy on yourself and others. This is an unusual situation, so don't beat yourself up for feeling anxious or upset, says Stern. Acknowledge your feelings and think about how to deal with them one step at a time.

Similarly, don't judge others for their anxieties or reactions. People are going to miss out on sports tournaments, graduations, weddings and even funerals, along with countless other celebrations, over the next few months. There are going to be disappointments. Those feelings are real, and they matter — even if other losses are happening that you might view as more serious. It's important for all of us to keep the bigger picture in perspective, but we still need to give ourselves (and those around us) permission to feel the feelings we have, Stern says.

3. Stay connected — virtually

Kruglanski suggests thinking of virtual meetups as both communication and commiseration. Sterns adds that it's times like these when we need one another most. And even though we can't physically be together, it's important to stay connected through social media, phone calls and video conferencing.

4. Try practicing radical acceptance

Get as comfortable as you can with the idea that many things — including those that you can normally control — are no longer within your control, Stern says. Right now, the only constant is change. It's a hard mindset to adopt, she says, but letting go of the things you can't control will help you focus on the things you can. She suggests starting with positive self-talk. Tell yourself that you'll concentrate on the things you can control, such as cooking a meal, calling a friend or starting your day with a workout.

5. Focus on the facts

It's important to stay informed about the new policies being implemented and any updated guidelines you should follow. But keep your focus on the facts without adding the ""what ifs,"" says Gould. He recommends that if you do find yourself in a cycle of catastrophic thinking, practicing deep breathing and mindfulness techniques to dial it back.

6. Avoid information overload

Stay informed, but don't read about the pandemic all day every day. Pick a few trusted sources of information and decide when you're going to tune in and check them. Then stick with that schedule. Constant news consumption, says Stern, is more likely to fuel your anxiety than to be helpful.

7. Have fun

It's a serious situation, but taking time to do the things that make you smile and laugh can make daily life more enjoyable, Stern says. Find the small joys in the situation, like getting to spend more time with loved ones, cooking or watching funny movies. We need those warm, caring moments right now, she says.

8. Be grateful for what you have

Spend some time thinking about the things that make you feel grateful. Then express your gratitude to others. Tell your friends and family how much you appreciate them. When they reciprocate, says Stern, accept their messages of appreciation and gratitude. Sharing these feelings can make us feel cared for — and make us feel good.

9. Take control of the things you can control

Focus on the aspects of your daily routine that you can still follow — or create a new routine that suits your current situation. Kruglanski says this can help you stay on track throughout the day, as well as allow you to continue progressing toward your bigger life goals. Look for opportunities to catch up on the backlog of things you always wished you had more time for, like learning a language, reading novels or reorganizing your closets. Find new routines that make you happy, says Kruglanski. ""Exploit the positive opportunities.""

319,Coronavirus: 12 questions to ask yourself to stay sane while in quarantine,"If six weeks ago you’d told me that my social calendar was about to free up entirely, that shoes would be a thing of the past and I’d have a dozen more hours a week free, I’d have leapt for joy. I was deeply craving some serious R&R, but living under lockdown during a global pandemic, it turns out, isn’t exactly a staycation. While self-isolating and social distancing may be the best actions we can take as a society to stem the spread of the coronavirus, it's challenging for many of us. As the days blur into weeks, it’s increasingly difficult to feel sane.

“Our bodies and our brains are set up to deal with short-term crises that have clear ends in sight,” says Allison Buskirk-Cohen, associate professor and chair of the psychology department at Delaware Valley University. “Long-term ambiguous stressors — like managing the COVID-19 situation — are much more challenging.”

One trick to help handle this stress — and break down the monotony of these long, long quarantine days and nights — is to routinely check in with yourself.

Good questions to ask yourself while quarantined

Here are 12 questions mental health clinicians recommend asking yourself every day.

1. ‘Have I flossed yet today?’

“This question is a silly way of asking about how you’re engaging in physical self-care,” says Burskirk-Cohen. “Self-care is about building healthy habits that you incorporate as part of your daily life: things like getting enough sleep and proper nutrition are critical building blocks. It’s a form of preventative health and shouldn’t be an emergency action.”

2. ‘What are my priorities today?’

“Long-term planning is anxiety provoking right now, since so much is changing each day,” says Buskirk-Cohen. “It’s really difficult to make any kind of long-term plan when you don’t know what’s going to be safe or feasible. Instead, I recommend concentrating on the present. Lists are helpful to me, so I’ll work on a list each morning, prioritizing the items from top to bottom. Simple things that are important, like eating meals, go on the list. Crossing them out gives a sense of accomplishment. It also helps me maintain my focus on priorities, and make sure they are reflecting my values.”

3. ‘How is my body feeling?’

“Doing a check in with your physical body gives you information about where you are feeling stress,” says Robin F. Goodman, licensed clinical psychologist. “Then you can do something to feel better physically, which will have a ripple effect on your mind and emotions.”

4. ‘What emotions am I feeling?’

“Paying attention to your emotions allows you to then be intentional about managing them,” Goodman says.

5. ‘Am I asking too much of myself?’

“We need to be able to recalibrate our expectations given that we are not operating under normal circumstances,” says Mitchell Hicks, clinical psychologist and core faculty member at Walden University's school of psychology. “We can’t give our all to work when we also need to care for children [all day].”

6. ‘Am I asking too much of others?’

“Just like we need to reconsider the expectations of ourselves, what we expect of others needs rethought,” says Hicks. “If you’re a two-income family with both partners working from home, you’ll need to renegotiate how you both work and manage children to try to reduce frustrations between you.”

7. 'What am I stressed about, and how important is it, really?'

“We can all get tied up in the moment-to-moment issues that pop up and seem to throw us off our game, but is it really that important?” Hicks says. “This can get us to calibrate our response.”

8. ‘What do I know for sure is true?’

“Having a few truths you can hold on to as factual can provide some stability at a time of so much uncertainty,” says Racine Henry, a licensed marriage and family therapist. “They can be large or small, [such as”] ‘I’m alive and well. I have food to eat. I don’t have to commute back and forth to work, etc.’”

9. ‘How will I connect with others in a way that celebrates joy?’

“One of the most difficult aspects of social distancing is that we lose interacting with others in enjoyable ways,” says Buskirk-Cohen. “Set regular ways of connecting with friends and family that are not directly related to COVID-19.”

10. ‘What can I do to help someone right now?’

“Looking at what you can do to contribute to others can improve gratitude and a sense of hopefulness,” says Goodman. “It can be as simple as sending a funny text to a friend, clapping out the window [for healthcare workers].”

11. ‘What new habits do I want to form during this time?’

“As difficult as this time is, it does present an opportunity to do things differently,” says Jonathan D. Horowitz, clinical psychologist and CEO of San Francisco Stress and Anxiety Center. “Are there changes you have wanted to make, in your routine, diet or workday? This may be a good time to implement them.”

12. ‘What do I want to learn from this event?’

‘We can't control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond to it, and the meaning that we make of it,” says Horowitz. “When we ask what we can learn from our difficulties, we see ourselves as empowered and capable, and we open the possibility for positive change.”",0
320,Americans are unhappier than ever — here's how to find joy in troubled times,"Americans are the unhappiest they've been in 50 years, according to the COVID Response Tracking Study, conducted in late-May by NORC at the University of Chicago. Only 14% of respondents said they were very happy, down 31% from the same period in 2018.

During such painful times, the idea of cultivating personal happiness might seem trivial — selfish, even — but it might just be more important now than ever before.

“All of this negative energy taxes the mind, body and spirit,” says Carla Marie Manly, a clinical psychologist and author of “Joy From Fear: Create The Life Of Your Dreams By Making Fear Your Friend.” “As such, it’s vital to intentionally counteract this toxic, fearful energy with a conscientious investment in creating happiness.”

Laurie Santos, a professor of psychology at Yale University who teaches the class “The Science of Well-Being” (an online version is presently free on Coursera), argues the importance of cultivating happiness for its potential health benefits alone. “There's evidence that positive moods can boost our immune system and can protect us from respiratory viruses, so it's not something to feel guilty about; it's a smart strategy just like washing our hands.”

But how does one actually boost happiness during a global pandemic? It’s certainly not as simple or tactile as washing one’s hands — but there are actions we can take to manifest joy. Here’s what experts recommend:",0
321,Music is getting me through this pandemic — a hobby can do the same for you,"The COVID-19 pandemic has increased anxiety and stress to such an extent that some experts are warning of a looming mental health crisis.

While the United Nations and the World Health Organization are making resources available to help with this, experts are also offering important advice. One key piece I’ve taken to heart comes from the Mayo Clinic: “Enjoy hobbies that you can do at home.” After all, “a distraction can get you away from the cycle of negative thoughts that feed anxiety and depression,” and doing “something positive to manage anxiety is a healthy coping strategy.”

Mayo isn’t alone in this. Numerous experts are encouraging people to return to the hobbies they may have left behind. For some, it might even help ward off a temptation to turn to alcohol.

But for many of us, these days can be extremely hectic. Perhaps you’ve got children at home, and are working to make sure they get educated online while also trying to do your job. Maybe you’ve got sick family members you’re trying to care for.

I’m remotely managing a team of six, and can easily feel that I always have to be “on.” And because I work in tech, people are relying on us more than ever. My company helps businesses move their phone systems to the cloud, which many are doing in the era of COVID-19. It’s a time filled with pressure.

To take care of my mental health, I’ve set aside time to unplug from work. I’ve used that time to recommit to music. I’ve been writing songs, playing my guitar and even making music videos. It has made my daily life better.

Any artistic pursuit can be therapeutic, which explains why many are used as part of therapy programs. And during this pandemic, music has played an especially important role for millions of people. As the World Economic Forum pointed out, crowds have been singing and playing musical instruments from balconies and joining virtual choirs online. (Jon Bon Jovi even gave a shout out to Chicagoans who sang “Livin’ on a Prayer.”)

If you don’t have a creative outlet, now may be a good time to start one. StoneSpring Hospital in Virginia says, “Now is the time to pick up a new instrument, learn how to paint or try a new cooking technique. If you’re not sure where to start, search YouTube for instructional videos.”

Whether you have an established interest or are just dabbling with a new one, here are three tips I recommend for reaping maximum benefits from it during this pandemic:

1. Schedule it

No matter how hectic things are, try to schedule time for your creative outlet. Then, do all you can to stick to it. It could be an hour a few times a week, or a block of a few hours once a week.

I scheduled my music time based on when I start to feel drained mentally. In general for me, that’s Thursdays. So each week on Thursday, I stop working at about 4pm, then spend the rest of the day doing music production and songwriting.

It’s a powerful way to recharge. I perform much better in my work on Fridays when I do this.

If you can seal yourself off in a room somewhere and be away from other people in your home during this time, that’s ideal.

2. Consider your personality type

While your hobby time is yours alone, in which you don’t have to take care of anyone else, you can share it virtually with people who have the same or similar interest. For example, if you want to make music together with a friend over video chat, you may find that fulfilling.

I’m introverted, specifically what Myers-Briggs calls INTJ. I’m experiencing Zoom burnout (also called Zoom fatigue) already. So for me, during a stressful week, the most therapeutic practice is to get in a zone and jam out alone.

3. Create a goal

I find it helpful to not just write and play music for fun, but to specifically have projects I want to accomplish. I look forward to these, and they help incentivize me to pull through on my scheduled time for music.

So I decided I was going to finally edit the music video a friend and I shot for a song we co-wrote, and I’m working toward an EP, a collection of five songs.

If you have children at home, some of these same steps may be very helpful for them as well. I know that music was important to me when I was growing up.

“It’s especially devastating to think about students who rely on music classes to get them through the school day. Or the students who could easily fall through the cracks without the safe spaces they’ve found in band, choir or orchestra,” an activist for music education wrote in a column republished by the Washington Post.

It’s a difficult time for all of us, and there are no easy answers. But if you commit to a pursuit you love, or discover a new one, you just may find that your week gets less exhausting, less stressful and more fruitful.

322,6 weird things you're probably feeling right now that are perfectly normal,"Guilt mixed with gratitude. Nostalgia tinged with remorse. Dread combined with anticipation. These are just a few of the feelings we might experience in a given day — or hour — while sheltering in place. This wacky mashup of intense emotions may make you concerned for your sanity, but according to mental health experts, this is all par for the course of living through a pandemic.

Here’s a look at some of the seemingly strange — but perfectly normal — feelings therapists have observed in their clients in recent weeks.

1. Wanting quarantine to end, but not really

“Many people privately express to me that they are ‘enjoying’ quarantine,” says Carla Manly, a clinical psychologist. “My introverted clients, in particular, are quite pleased with the slower pace of life. Yet, at the same time, it is also normal to desperately want the shelter-in-place orders to end given that they are government-imposed rather than a personal choice.”

2. Guilt and gratitude at the same time

Alisa Kamis-Brinda, licensed clinical social worker, notices patients feeling profound guilt along with a sense of gratitude.

“They are grateful for all that they have, but like everyone else, have uncomfortable feelings about the changes in their lives or feel fearful about what is happening,” Kamis-Brinda says. “Then they remember that there are people who are really struggling with health, financial issues or basic needs. Their mind tells them that they shouldn’t feel bad because of all that they have. It makes sense. They are human and struggling with the scary things going on and the major changes in their lives. At the same time, they know that they are fortunate for all that they have.”

3. A drop in anxiety when you’re typically really anxious

“One interesting paradox I've noticed among my clients who have pre-existing anxiety is actually a reduction in their anxious symptoms, since they feel that, finally, everyone around them is experiencing what they have felt in ‘normal’ times,” says Rebecca Shaw, licensed clinical social worker.

“During normal times, people who suffer from anxiety often feel out of place. That’s both a symptom of the anxiety itself and a byproduct of living in a society in which the majority of people do not experience clinical anxiety. That byproduct effect can compound the symptoms that are already there, making the experience of anxiety much more intense — but in the society we’re living in these days — with markedly higher numbers of people experiencing severe anxiety for the first time — a percentage of those who already suffered from anxiety before the pandemic no longer have that ‘out of place in society’ feeling. It’s almost as if pre-coronavirus anxiety sufferers are veterans of the condition. It’s definitely important to note that those experiencing a decrease in their anxiety symptoms are in the minority, but the phenomenon is fascinating nonetheless.”

4. Nostalgia for the past — and regret for the road not taken

“This smaller world we find ourselves in might remind us of our childhoods, and we might be drawn to things we haven't thought about in a long time,” says Randy Paterson, a psychologist and author. “Related to this is a flight to security. For example, we might find ourselves drawn to the books we read as children or old television shows. I was in a store the other day and found myself looking over the Lego kits.”

Paterson also observes people feeling “regret for opportunities not taken,” adding: “We lived in a world of thousands of restaurants, parks, activities, friends we could have invited over, vacations we might have taken, changes that we could have made in our lives when we had more security and freedom, and so on. For now, at least, many of these opportunities are limited.”

5. Intense grief without a direct cause

“Many clients have expressed a sense of grief and loss that is not commensurate with their direct experience,” says Natalie Mica, licensed professional counselor. “This is a normal reaction to the multitude of losses the collective is facing during this time. In addition, the loss of routine schedules, hobbies, touch, pleasures, entertainment, etc. can account for this.”

6. Apprehension about returning to ‘normal’

“Some people are realizing that they were pretty unhappy in pre-pandemic times, and are unenthusiastic about the idea of returning to an unsatisfying job, or to commuting,” says Jennie Steinberg, licensed marriage family therapist. “Other people really want to resume their pre-pandemic lives but feel a lot of fear about going back out into the world. A lot of people are feeling very uncertain about what ‘moving forward’ looks like.”

Accept these feelings and don’t judge yourself

What are we to do with all these mixed up feelings? Just let them be. Don’t judge or try to change them.

“Accepting our feelings for what they are, rather than trying to fight them, is crucial, since fighting ourselves leads to exhaustion, anger and self-blame — not to mention, it doesn't really work,” says Shaw.

Celeste Viciere, licensed mental health clinician suggests we might also boost our self-compassion given that none of us “has experienced being in a pandemic” before. “There is no right or wrong way to feel. Take it one day at a time. If today is not a good day, that is OK. Work on resetting tomorrow.”",0
323,How to survive coronavirus anxiety: 8 tips from mental health experts,"The spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. is creating a new age of anxiety and it’s no surprise.

With airports filled with travelers in masks, stores selling out of disinfectant and public health officials urging Americans to prepare for the bug to disrupt daily life, the national level of worry seems to be off the charts.

Mental health experts emphasized it’s normal, and potentially even helpful, to feel anxious at this time.

“Anxiety, when it’s at the right level, encourages us to take positive action,” Dr. Kelli Harding, an assistant professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, told TODAY.

“It’s OK to have that moment of panic because, in a way, if you can move beyond that, you can start making adequate precautions.”

The problem comes when people start stewing in their fear.

The anxiety is being driven by collective uncertainty over what will happen, even though evidence so far shows the new virus causes mild symptoms in most cases, said Joshua Klapow, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor of public health at The University of Alabama at Birmingham.

People may experience everything from feeling nervous as they watch the news, to experiencing panic when they’re near somebody who coughs or sneezes, he noted. It doesn’t matter if the person with sniffles is someone affected by allergy season.

NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel called it ""coughobia.""

Coughobia. coughing can be healthy. It’s a clearing of the airways. I have a son who struggles to cough on his own. It’s a major problem. Tdy, got an email from a woman with allergies, says she terrifies people when she sniffles. societal pressures, emerging part of virus story. — Richard Engel (@RichardEngel) March 3, 2020

“People are now quick to jump to a worst-case scenario. That creates ongoing distress,” Klapow said. “Anxiety is sticky. We tend to make illogical leaps when we’re nervous.”

Ironically, feeling stressed like this not only feels bad, but increases the risk for becoming ill.

When a person’s biological alarm system is over-activated, it floods the body with cortisol — a stress hormone that suppresses the immune system, said Sherry Benton, a licensed psychologist in Tampa, Florida, and founder of TAO Connect, which provides online mental health therapy.

“What’s dangerous is if your anxiety is really exaggerated,” Benton said. “What’s happening to you emotionally? Are you walking around terrified that this is coming, or are you able to prepare and then get on with your life?”

The best treatment for anxiety is often positive action, Harding noted.

Here are some simple steps you can take right now to feel better:

1. Take a media break

Don’t immerse yourself in news about the coronavirus 24/7. “You have to stop scouring social media and the internet for the latest twists and turns,” Klapow advised. Stay up to date using trusted sources, like the website of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, then step away.

2. Wash your hands frequently

It’s something that will actually lower your risk of getting sick. Learn how to do it properly: for a full 20 seconds using warm water and soap. “It’s quite incredible how helpful that is,” Harding noted.

3. Practice good self-care

Get plenty of nutrients by eating fruits and vegetables, exercise regularly and get enough sleep. “We know that sleep has a direct impact on the immune system. So you can take all the vitamin C you want, but if you’re sleep deprived, your immune system is compromised,” Klapow noted.

“Although those things seem very benign — they don’t seem as potent as putting on a face mask — they are things all of us can do to stay as healthy and as infection-free as possible.”

4. Take sensible steps to prepare

There's definitely reason to take precaution, so being adequately prepared will provide peace of mind. Ready.gov, the government's website, has concrete tips, like storing a two-week supply of water and food.

5. Go for a walk outside

Time spent in nature is soothing for the mind and body. Sunlight may lower your blood pressure, research has found. “If you can, get a little sunshine during your day. Take a stroll. Take a deep breath,” Harding suggested.

6. Acknowledge your anxiety

It's generally unhelpful to tell a highly-anxious person to just stop feeling anxious, Harding said. Instead — whether it's coronavirus or another panic-provoking situation — it's useful to just acknowledge the anxiety and work through it. ""Name it to tame it"" is a mantra in mental health for big emotions, she noted.

7. Write down your worries

Seeing the words on paper or on a screen may stop you from spinning yourself into a frenzy.

“What are you catastrophizing? Write down the things you find yourself thinking and reflect on them. Challenge your own thinking to get it more in balance and reasonable,” Benton said.

8. Send a little love to people who you care about

Put together a text message chain or email chain with family on it — that way you can have it set up before it feels like an emergency situation and easily communicate with your loved ones. “We’re definitely not in this alone,” Harding said.",0

Kristen Little

Eggs and sweet potatoes are the perfect pair and staples in my house. I always stock up on when I am at the grocery store because they both last for a long time. I love making eggs with a baked sweet potato and some cinnamon for breakfast, but I wanted to create something new that would be a dish you could eat for any meal. Enter harissa shakshuka.

Shakshuka is traditionally a breakfast food made in a cast-iron pan, but there is just never enough for my whole family to enjoy. This version makes enough for everyone — and there's usually enough for seconds!

325,8 flavor-packed ways to use up cherry tomatoes,"Whether it’s the dead of winter or the peak of summer, cherry tomatoes should always be on your shopping list. Unlike larger varieties, cherry tomatoes are available ripe and ready year round. And despite their small size, they’re packed with bright, tomato flavor and just enough sweetness. They’re also wonderfully juicy and pop in your mouth, thanks to their delicate skin.

Though often enjoyed raw in salads or on veggie platters, cherry tomatoes are as versatile as their big brothers and can be used in pasta, pizza, sauces and more. For kitchen inspiration, we asked some of our favorite food pros, including Giada De Laurentiis, Katie Workman, Kelly Senyei, Jennifer Marie Garza, Abra Berens, Martha Stewart, Serena Wolf and Kirsten Buck for their best recipes and tips. If you don’t already have cherry tomatoes in your fridge, you’ll want to add a pint — or maybe two — to your grocery list.

Pesto pizza toast Elizabeth Newman

Caramelized cherry tomatoes are the “star” of this easy dish, says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis. They add “an irresistible pop of sweetness” and great color if you use a mix of red and yellow. “Cherry tomatoes are one of the only kinds of tomatoes I'll use all year round,” adds De Laurentiis. They make “this pesto pizza a go-to for an easy weeknight dinner, no matter what month we are in.”

Spaghetti with Cherry Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella and Basil Serena Wolf

“Cherry tomatoes have such a delightful sweetness, says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of ""The Dude Diet Dinnertime:125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners"". Wolf’s simple pasta sauce “highlights their bright, fresh flavor with just a little olive oil, slivered garlic and crushed red pepper for heat.” She cuts some of the tomatoes and leaves the rest whole, for a more interesting texture. “The halved tomatoes break down almost completely, while the larger ones simply soften and add an extra pop of chew and flavor when you bite into them,” Wolf explains.

BELT Salad With Dairy-Free Dilly Ranch Dressing Kristen Buck

Kristen Buck, author of ""Buck Naked Kitchen: Radiant and Nourishing Recipes to Fuel Your Health Journey,"" calls this salad a “lightened up, veggie forward” take on a classic BLT sandwich. Hardboiled eggs add protein and make the salad more substantial, while the Dilly Ranch Dressing is “a step up from standard mayo.” Cherry tomatoes are the most important ingredient, insists Buck, because they add “freshness, acidity and sweetness.” Her favorites are fresh, local and from the farmers’ market in summer, but with sweet, tender cherry tomatoes available year round, you can enjoy this salad whenever you like.

Baked Chicken Caprese Low Carb Inspirations

This easy-to-make, Caprese salad–inspired chicken dish comes from Jennifer Marie Garza, the author of ""Keto Friendly Recipes: Easy Keto for Busy People"" and the blogger behind Low Carb Inspirations. “Cherry tomatoes carry a powerful punch of concentrated tomato flavor” and pair perfectly with chicken, Italian seasonings and mozzarella, explains Garza. “I wouldn’t make this recipe without them!”

Salmon with Polenta and Warm Tomato Vinaigrette Cheyenne Cohen

A warm tomato vinaigrette makes “a great counterpoint” to rich, pan-roasted salmon in this easy yet elegant dish from Katie Workman, the blogger behind The Mom 100 and author of ""Dinner Solved: 100 Ingenious Recipes that Make the Whole Family Happy, Including You"". Just a few minutes on the stove “slightly collapses the cherry tomatoes, and their juices lend a really nice sweet acidity to a simple vinaigrette” made with shallot, oregano, oil and vinegar. Once you make this easy sauce, you’ll want to put it on everything, including chicken, pork or beef. “Definitely think of it when you are grilling this summer,” says Workman.

Tomato Panzanella with Corn, Cucumbers, and Herb Salad EE Berger

Panzanella, at its most fundamental, is a bread salad,” explains Abra Berens, author of ""Ruffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables"". She also describes it as a “one of those magical dishes that becomes more than the sum of its parts.” All kinds of tomatoes are used in panzanella, but Berens likes using cherry tomatoes in this version, because their shape contrasts with the torn bread and small kernels of corn. “Plus, they don’t juice as much as large globe tomatoes, so you can control the texture of the salad longer.” And, perhaps best of all, the combination of cherry tomatoes and frozen corn makes this a year-round dish.

Cherry Tomato Crisp Martha Stewart

“This warm, comforting side dish is the perfect unexpected complement to any main,” says cooking and entertaining expert Martha Stewart. To create this savory spin on the dessert crisp we all know and love, Stewart swaps fruit for cherry tomatoes and turns breadcrumbs, grated cheese and fresh parsley into an irresistible crunchy topping. “I love the combination of the bursting cherry tomatoes with the crispy bread and Parmesan,” says Stewart.

Quick Shrimp Scampi Kelly Senyei

“Shrimp scampi may seem like a fancy, restaurant-only dish,” but it’s surprisingly simple to make at home,” insists Just a Taste blogger Kelly Senyei. “You really only need a few ingredients to develop a big punch of flavor.” Cherry tomatoes work perfectly in this pasta, because they “soak up all that garlicky, lemony white wine sauce.” Best of all, “aside from cooking the pasta, this entire dish comes together in one pan, making cooking and cleanup a total breeze.”

326,Better than takeout: 6 inexpensive and easy versions of your favorite Korean dishes,"If you’re watching your budget this time of year (and who isn’t?) you’re probably taking a hard look at what you spend on food. And yet it’s busy this time of year, so it’s tempting to turn to takeout or delivery to streamline the dinner routine.

Forget the expense of takeout and the charge for delivery. You can serve up your own Korean favorites for less, and prepare them just the way you like. Here’s how.

Bibimbap Courtesy of Korean Bapsang

Bibimbap is simply rice topped with vegetables, meat and sauce. Don’t be put off by the long list of ingredients in this recipe. Hyosun Ro, who blogs at Korean Bapsang: A Korean mom’s home cooking, includes a collection of toppings you could choose, but just three of four of them would make a decent bibimbap.

“Bibimbap is much easier to make at home than you might think. You can use leftover side dishes from previous meals, or quickly cut up and blanch or sauté whatever vegetables you have in the fridge or find in your local grocery store,” Ro says.

Just about any vegetables will do — mushrooms, zucchini, cucumbers, carrots, spinach, bean sprouts or broccoli slaw, for example. “You only need three or four of these vegetables and your choice of protein such as beef, pork, chicken or even seafood,” she says.

Kimchi Stew Courtesy of My Korean Kitchen

Sue Pressey, creator of My Korean Kitchen, says kimchi jjigae is a staple Korean dish. “Many Korean home cooks make it at home often because it’s very easy and quick to make using readily available ingredients,” she says. “Also, by making it at home, you can easily adjust the spice level of the stew.”

While you can swap the meat based on what you have on hand or your dietary needs, Pressey is a fan of this kimchi jjigae made with pork belly. She says, “When the fat melts into the stew, it adds depth of flavor, making the stew extra hearty and comforting. Just perfect for wintery weather!”

Ready to try making your own Korean barbecue? Chungah Rhee, CEO and founder of Damn Delicious: Quick and Easy Meals for the Home Cook, says it’s easy and shares her take on the recipe for beef bulgogi her mom used to make.

“This is one of my favorite Korean dishes to make at home,” she says. “The secret is freezing the steak for 30 minutes to help slice it real thin.” Those thin slices soak up the marinade and cook quickly, so outside of the marinating this dish comes together in no time.

Serve it with rice and kimchi, or in red leaf lettuce tacos. “It’s a perfect weeknight meal,” Rhee says.

It’s getting easier to find sushi-grade fish these days — you might see it in Asian markets, grocery stores that carry prepared sushi, frozen-food cases or online. If a fish isn’t marked as sushi grade, ask — don’t assume it’s OK to eat raw.

Finding sushi-grade fish means making sashimi dishes like dup bap at home can be accessible and affordable. This recipe calls for tuna, salmon and red snapper, but you can mix and match your favorite sushi-grade seafood.

Grace Park, co-founder of Crazy Korean Cooking, recommends preparing this dish for a group, since buying different types of sushi-grade fish is expensive, though not nearly as costly as a restaurant meal.

As with the bibimbap, don’t be intimidated by the long list of ingredients. You can build it with whatever you like. Just the fish, lettuce and sauce would come together nicely. “You can add vegetables and green leaf lettuce, perilla leaves, radish and chili peppers for the best flavor and authenticity,” Park says. “And for picky eaters, you can also just use whatever fish you like.”

Kimbap Courtesy of kimchimari.com

At a glance, you might mistake these Korean seaweed rice rolls for sushi. While they look similar, kimbap typically includes ground beef or prepared meat like Spam instead of raw fish. But like sushi, the rolls come in many different flavors depending on how you fill them.

Korean food blogger JinJoo Lee of Kimchimari: Authentic Korean Recipes Even You Can Cook, shares three different versions of kimbap — the classic beef and vegetables, a variation with burdock roots and cucumbers, and a quick version that uses ham or Spam.

“Even if it’s your very first time making it, you are sure to succeed without too much difficulty and be able to make your kimbap just the way you want it,” Lee says.

Mandu Courtesy of Rasa Malaysia

Bee Yinn Low, the food blogger behind Rasa Malaysia, says that dumplings are traditionally served as part of the Lunar New Year celebration. These are so delicious, though, you’ll want to enjoy them all year round. And while wrapping the dumplings can take a bit of time, you can make 20 to 30 dumplings with her mandu recipe and freeze what you don’t eat, so you’ll have a quick snack or meal ready the next time you’re craving them.

The dumplings get a unique Korean flavor and texture from the kimchi in the filling. “The recipe is so easy and versatile,” Low says. “You can customize the ingredients in the filling and choose the preferred protein — pork, beef, chicken, turkey or vegetarian. It’s also very affordable because you can make dozens of the dumplings with the recipe.”

327,How to make a classic Margherita pizza (and your own dough) at home,"The classic. Get on it. Or add toppings just as they do down at the pie shop in town: cooked crumbled sausage or ground beef; pitted black olives; sauteed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; pepperoni; anchovies; whatever you like.

Ingredients

1 round pizza dough (recipe follows)

3 tablespoons pizza sauce (recipe follows)

Extra-virgin olive oil

2 3/4 ounces fresh mozzarella

4 to 5 fresh basil leaves, roughly torn

Directions

Place a pizza stone or tiles on the middle rack of your oven and turn the heat to its highest setting. Let the oven heat for at least an hour. Stretch the dough and use a spoon to apply the sauce to its center. Use the back of the spoon to spread the sauce evenly across the surface, stopping about 1/₂ inch from the edges. Drizzle a little oil over the pie. Break the cheese into large pieces and place these gently on the sauce. Add other toppings, if using any, to taste. Scatter the basil leaves over the top. Using a pizza peel, pick up the pie and slide it onto the heated stone in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 4 to 8 minutes.

THE BEST PIZZA DOUGH

Ingredients

306 grams “00” flour (about 2 cups plus 2 tablespoons)

306 grams all-purpose flour (about 2 cups plus 3 tablespoons), plus more for dusting

16 grams kosher salt (about 2 teaspoons)

4 grams active dry yeast (about 1 ¹/₂ teaspoons)

8 grams extra-virgin olive oil (about 2 teaspoons)

Directions

In a large mixing bowl, combine the “00” flour, all-purpose flour, and salt. In a small mixing bowl, stir together 400 grams (a little less than 2 cups) lukewarm tap water, the yeast, and the oil, then pour it into the flour mixture. Knead with your hands until well combined, about 3 minutes, then let the mixture rest for 15 minutes. Knead the rested dough for 3 minutes. Cut into 4 equal pieces and shape each into a ball. Place on a heavily floured surface, cover with a dampened cloth, and allow to rest and rise for 3 to 4 hours at room temperature or for 8 to 24 hours in the refrigerator. (If you refrigerate the dough, remove it 30 to 45 minutes before you begin to shape it for pizza.) To make pizza, place each dough ball on a heavily floured surface and use your fingers to stretch it, then your hands to shape it into rounds or squares. Top and bake.

HOW TO STRETCH PIZZA DOUGH

Working on a floured surface, with floured hands, softly pat down the risen ball of dough into a circle, rotating it as you do. Using the tips of your fingers, push down gently around the perimeter of the pie, rotating it as you do, to create the edge. Pick up the dough and lightly pass it back and forth between your palms, trying to rotate it each time you do, using gravity to help the dough stretch. At about 12 inches in diameter, the pizza is ready to go. Return the pizza to the floured surface, making sure that the side that you first pressed down on remains facing upward, and gently slide the pie back and forth a few times to make sure that it does not stick. Add a little more flour to the surface beneath the pie if it does. Gently slide a lightly floured pizza peel beneath the pie, or place it carefully on a floured cutting board or the back of a baking pan. Make sure again that the dough can slide back and forth. If it does, the pie is certified for topping.

A SIMPLE PIZZA SAUCE

Empty a 28-ounce can of good tomatoes into a food processor or blender. Add a splash of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt. Whiz that together and use about 3 tablespoons per pie. Leftover sauce can be kept, covered, in the refrigerator and used for more pizzas later, or as a simple pasta sauce.

328,How to make pancakes at home so flippin' easily,"Who doesn’t love waking up to the sweet smell of homemade pancakes, especially when you can eat them in your pajamas? Plus, making pancakes is really easy. Try this basic foolproof recipe and feel free to jazz it up with flavorful add-ins like fruit, cinnamon or chocolate.

First, prepare the dry and wet ingredients separately. Kelly Senyei

Prepare the batter by whisking together 1½ cups of all-purpose flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. In a separate small bowl, whisk together 1¼ cups whole milk with 1 large egg and 2 tablespoons of melted unsalted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until combined.

Take care not to over-mix your batter. Kelly Senyei

Avoid over-mixing the batter to ensure your pancakes are light and fluffy rather than dense and flat. The batter should still be lumpy after you mix it.

Once bubbles form on the tops of the pancakes, it's time to flip! Kelly Senyei

Heat a skillet or griddle pan over medium-low heat then grease it with vegetable oil, butter or a combination of the two. Drop 3 to 4 tablespoons of batter into the pan, spacing the pancakes at least 2 inches apart. At this point, you can sprinkle assorted mix-ins on top, such as chocolate chips, fruit or nuts. Once bubbles form on the tops of the pancakes, flip them once and continue cooking until they are no longer doughy.

Top with all the syrup and butter your heart desires. Kelly Senyei

Using a spatula, transfer the pancakes to a plate and serve immediately with your choice of toppings.

329,"7 simple, satisfying egg recipes for breakfast, lunch or dinner","Put an egg on it? Sure, but why stop there? In terms of nutrition, eggs pack a punch and are a source of protein, iron, vitamins and minerals. They’re also inexpensive and easy to cook, plus eggs can be prepared in myriad ways from baked to poached to fried to scrambled and are wildly versatile, working with a wide range of ingredients and in a variety of different cuisines. There’s also the fact that eggs are the kind of staple ingredient we always pick up at the market and always keep in the fridge.

All that is to say, there’s no need to limit eggs to topping your favorite dishes and there’s certainly no need to reserve them for breakfast and brunch. To help you make and enjoy egg’s full potential, we’ve rounded up recipes and tips from chefs and food pros, including Andrew Zimmern, Giada De Laurentiis, Teri Turner, Kevin Curry and Stacy Adimando. They’ve shared their favorites, which range from Middle Eastern-inspired baked eggs to a quick and irresistible pasta to egg-filled potato skins. If you don’t have eggs in your fridge already, you better go pick up a dozen — or maybe two!

Idaho Sunrises Credit: Teri Turner

If there’s anything better than potato skins, it’s definitely these scrambled egg–filled and bacon-topped potato skins, created by Teri Turner, author of ""No Crumbs Left: Recipes for Everyday Food Made Marvelous"". Potato skins, says Turner, are “a spectacular carrier for just about anything.” Scramble some eggs, add bacon and chives, and you have a hearty breakfast or light dinner that’s “crunchy on the outside, buttery on the inside, with a luscious bite of egg,” says Turner. “It’s absolutely delicious.”

Sweet Onion Carbonara Courtesy of Giadzy

When it comes to turning eggs into dinner, TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis looks to pasta and specifically, carbonara, a Roman classic that uses eggs, cream and cheese to create an irresistibly luscious sauce. “I am a big fan of reinventing classics and this carbonara is no exception,” she explains. “I love the sweetness the dish gets from the caramelized onions.” To keep that creamy sauce creamy, cook it over low heat and only briefly. “The eggs add a wonderful velvety texture from just warming them through and cooking gently,” says De Laurentiis. “You wouldn’t want to end up with pasta a la scrambled eggs!”

Linguine and Prosciutto Frittatas Courtesy of Giadzy

These pasta-filled frittatas are a spin on pizza di spaghetti, a dish De Laurentiis grew up eating and that was often made with leftover pasta from the night before. Frittatas are flexible and can be filled with almost anything. In addition to linguine, De Laurentiis packs hers with prosciutto, garlic and fresh parsley, plus Asiago, mozzarella and mascarpone. “These mini versions are perfect for a weekend brunch or even a weeknight dinner alongside a salad,” says De Laurentiis, who also likes to pack them in her daughter’s lunchbox.

Salad with Poached Eggs and Bacon Vinaigrette Photo credit: Madeleine Hill

“You taste the purity of eggs when you poach them,” says Andrew Zimmern, the James Beard Award–winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""Bizarre Foods"". While he uses poached eggs for all kinds of dishes, including eggs benedict and on top of burgers and waffles, Zimmern “adores the flavor of eggs paired with greens, vinaigrette and of course, bacon,” as in this elegant salad he created. For perfect poached eggs, Zimmern says “timing is everything,” as you don’t want to overcook them. Another trick is to “use acidulated water to keep the whites gathered.”

Chilaquiles Photo credit: Madeleine Hill

Zimmern also adds eggs to chilaquiles, a Mexican dish featuring fried corn tortillas that are cooked in salsa and sprinkled with cheese. “Paired with fried eggs, they are one of my favorite breakfasts,” says Zimmern, who recommends using a super-hot pan to fry eggs. “Let the edges get lacy and crispy before serving,” he says.

Tex-Mex Shakshuka Courtesy of FitMenCook

Inspired by a trip to Israel, this is fitness influencer and ""Fit Men Cook"" author Kevin Curry’s take on shakshuka, a Mediterranean dish in which eggs are poached in a tomato-based sauce flavored with different herbs and spices. Because shakshuka is another highly adaptable egg dish, Curry puts a Tex-Mex spin on his version. “Life’s all about finding ways to mix things up!” says Curry. “Crossing recipes and flavor profiles that would never normally share a plate is a great way to add variety.” With that in mind, Curry incorporates onion, green bell pepper and spicy chili powder, along with more traditional spices like cumin and coriander.

Broccolini Frittata Photo credit: Linda Pugliese

“Forgiving” and “endlessly adaptable” is how Stacy Adimando, author of ""Piatti: Plates and Platters for Sharing, Inspired by Italy"" describes frittatas. Adimando’s features broccolini and is topped with chopped anchovies, grated cheese, or both, depending on your preferences, but you can use “almost any cooked vegetable, cheese or herb,” she insists. Plus, frittatas can be served hot, at room temperature or even chilled. Finishing a frittata in the oven is a little easier, but Adimando insists flipping one on the stovetop isn’t as hard as it seems. “Have confidence and be sure to wiggle the first side of the frittata loose in the pan before transferring it to a plate and flipping.” Also, use a nonstick skillet or at least a very well-seasoned one.

330,"Move over, chicken noodle. Here are 6 twists on chicken soup you'll love","January is maybe the ""soupiest"" month in the calendar year. It’s cold, the over-the-topness of the holidays has come to a close, and we’re all trying to reign it in a bit. Soup is also comforting, easy to make, versatile, perfect for incorporating leftovers, and just downright delicious. And if the soup community (what, it’s not a thing?) could elect their leader, it would almost definitely be chicken soup. Which has the reputation for also being “medicinal” as well as soothing and savory — if you want to challenge that contention, go ahead. I’ll argue back while slurping on some chicken noodle soup.

And guess what? Pretty much every part of the world has a version of chicken soup! While many of us do think of the classic American/Jewish chicken noodle soup, or maybe even chicken matzoh ball soup, or the perfect storm of chicken noodle matzoh ball soup (food of the gods) as the quintessential chicken soup, there’s lots more chicken soups to sample.

And how simple and pleasurable to explore other cuisines by experimenting with different flavors in the guise of one of the most welcoming soup categories out there. Whether you’re fighting the cold, or fighting an actual cold, a bowl of chicken soup is just the thing.

Red Lentil, Fennel and Chicken Slow Cooker Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

This Indian-ish inspired soup is completely satisfying, thick, fragrant with cumin and coriander, and slightly dal-like in personality because of the red lentils. Fennel is like celery that’s done some push-ups, with an anise-ish flavor that elevates everything else. And the fresh parsley at the end kind of makes the soup, for me. Plus, a slow-cooker soup — always a yes.

Thai Chicken Noodle Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

Comfort food, but on the lighter side. If you’ve never cooked with rice noodles, let’s take a quick pause. There is nothing hard about cooking them, in the same way that there is nothing hard about cooking any kind of noodles or pasta. The difference is with rice noodles, you are usually giving them a soak in very hot water, versus adding them to a pot of boiling water. The coconut milk adds nuttiness and creamy-ness, the fish sauce adds umami (which roughly translates to the word savory-ness) and both are easy to find in the Asian section of the supermarket, or online. A bit of lime juice, ginger, and jalapeño elevate the flavor and will also help clear out any congestion!

The Easiest Shortcut Chicken Ramen Noodle Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

It’s not the complicated recipe creation that makes me feel happy and proud so much ... it’s the easy ones. You simply simmer the bones and skin of a rotisserie chicken (everything but the meat, which you shred and save for the soup itself) in some broth, all on their own, or with the addition of a few chunks of carrot, celery and onion if you feel like taking one extra step. Then you strain the broth and add cooked ramen noodles (you’ll toss those little salty packets of “flavoring”). Add some sliced carrots and celery to the strained broth for color and flavor and texture and a nod to the fact that it’s nice to have produce in your chicken noodle soup. The dill is optional though it does make chicken noodle soup taste like chicken noodle soup to folks who grew up with the Jewish version of this soup.

Avgolemono Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

Avgolemono is the lemony chicken soup of Greece. It has a richness and a thickness that comes from whisking in some eggs into part of the liquid, then whisking that mixture back into the whole pot. It’s sometimes made with rice, but often made with orzo (a rice-shaped noodle), which I used here. Our family likes a lot of bang for their buck in their chicken soup, so this one is fairly well populated with chicken, orzo and fresh herbs.

Fragrant Chicken Tomato Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

The word “fragrant” is in the title because when the coriander and the cumin join the chicken and the onions in the hot pan, the smell will make everyone within 250 feet feel instantly ravenous. This soup is chunky and the tomatoes add a lovely richness and acidity.

Mexican Tortilla Chicken Soup Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom 100

This divine soup is scented with chili, cumin and coriander, and topped with all kinds of deliciousness, like avocado and tortilla crisps. This is one of my favorite soups of all time.

331,"Healthier takeout noodle recipes: pad Thai, japchae, ramen and more","With their soft, tender texture and knack for absorbing and delivering bursts of flavor, noodles are one of the most satisfying and crave-worthy dishes around — and perfect for the long days under lockdown when we all need some comfort in a bowl. Of course, it’s easy to hit up your favorite food delivery app, where you’ll no doubt find a wide assortment of noodle dishes. However, an even better option is to ditch the takeout and make your own noodles.

Homemade noodle dishes are not just easier and faster than you think; they’re also far better for you. When you choose the ingredients and do the cooking, you know just what’s going in your bowl — and belly — and can control not only the quality and nutrition, but also the flavor. You’ll likely want to follow a recipe, but if you love red peppers yet loathe green ones, you can customize the ingredient list to suit your palette.

Looking for recipe inspiration? We’ve got you covered. Here, food pros, including Giada De Laurentiis, Serena Wolf, Kelly Senyei, Kevin Curry and Alexandra Stafford, share their best noodles dishes, plus cooking tips and ingredient swaps. With these recipes and tips, all that’s left is to stock the pantry and boil some water!

By making japchae at home, you can control the amount of oil and sugar in the dish. Elizabeth Newman for Giadzy

""Making your own japchae at home is really quite easy and quick to do,” insists TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis. This Korean stir-fry is traditionally made with potato starch vermicelli noodles, but you can substitute angel hair pasta. “You also get to control the amount of oil and sugar in the dish,” says De Laurentiis. “In my version, I swap in honey for refined sugar and pack it with tons of healthy and colorful veggies for a bowl of noodles everyone will enjoy.”

This healthier pad Thai recipe doubles down on the cabbage and pulls back on the noodles. Kevin Curry/Fit Men Cook

“A flavor journey,” is how fitness influencer and ""Fit Men Cook"" author Kevin Curry describes his Chicken Pad Thai. “It’s a robust medley,” featuring crunchy cabbage, chewy chicken and a vibrant and complex sauce, plus hearty brown rice noodles. To make his version of this takeout classic a bit lighter and leaner, Curry doubles down on the cabbage and pulls back on the noodles. “I like to prioritize vegetables, because they’re “filling and help cut calories,” notes Curry. And if chicken’s not your thing, swap in shrimp, tofu or flank steak.

In addition to being gluten free, butternut squash noodles add an extra serving of vegetables to your day. Kevin Curry/Fit Men Cook

Love spaghetti and meat sauce but not the weighed down feeling you get after devouring a big bowl? We feel you and so does Curry, who created this better-for-you version made with butternut squash noodles and ground lamb. In addition to being gluten free, butternut squash noodles add an extra serving of vegetables to your day. Ground lamb is a fattier meat, which means you need very little oil to cook it in. Alternatively, you can sub lean ground beef or turkey. If you’re short on time — or don’t have a spiralizer — Curry says it’s fine to use pre-spiralized veggies from the supermarket and says he sometimes does so, too — just make sure they’re as fresh possible.

This recipe uses that package of ramen noodles in the back of your pantry -- along with almost any vegetable you have on hand. Alexandra Stafford

“I love so many things about this recipe,” says ""Bread Toast Crumbs"" author and Alexandra’s Kitchen blogger Alexandra Stafford. “It’s fast, it’s loaded with vegetables and the dressing is made with pantry staples, so when time is at a premium, I can throw these noodles together.” And then there’s the taste. The sauce has a “salty-sweet dynamic” and “a nice amount of heat thanks to crushed red pepper flakes,” says Stafford. Best of all, this dish can be made with so many different vegetables, from cabbage, Swiss chard, kale and bok choy to carrots, bell peppers and snap peas. “The key is to cut the vegetables thinly, so they cook quickly,” notes Stafford.

These drunken noodles can be customized with any kind of protein, vegetable or protein. Kelly Senyei

“Making takeout-inspired dishes from scratch guarantees you know every single ingredient that goes into it,” says Just a Taste blogger Kelly Senyei. “Best of all, you can customize with different proteins or varying degrees of spice to suit your palate.” This Thai favorite is traditionally made with wide rice noodles, and though it might not be authentic, “any noodle will work, including Italian varieties, such as pappardelle and tagliatelle,” says Senyei. “The thicker the noodle, the more surface area to soak up all that garlicky sauce.” And when it comes to stir-frying, Senyei’s top tip is to have all your ingredients fully prepped before you start cooking. “Stir-frying is a very fast cooking technique, and you don't want to have to stop mid-process to find the garlic or dice the peppers.”

This Thai-inspired curry is made with good-for-you ingredients, including veggies, lean protein and coconut milk. Serena Wolf

“This dish comes together in less time than it takes to get takeout or delivery — 25 minutes max,” says Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of ""The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners"". It’s also “loaded with bright, fresh flavor, tender shrimp and plenty of delicate rice noodles.” Despite its decadent flavor, this Thai-inspired curry “is made with good-for-you ingredients, including veggies, lean protein and coconut milk.” And like most noodle dishes, it’s ripe for improvisation. Halibut, cod, salmon or chicken make great swaps for the shrimp. Or, go vegan with tofu or chickpeas.

This plant-based dish is packed with filling fiber and protein and comes together in about 30 minutes. Serena Wolf

Roasted cauliflower turns “beautifully caramelized and buttery in the oven and pairs amazingly well with the slight nuttiness of buckwheat soba noodles,” says Wolf of this unexpected veggie and noodle combo. Her ginger-scallion dressing is simple but lends “awesome umami flavor with just the right amount of heat,” while “a squeeze of fresh lime juice just before serving brightens things up.” This is also a plant-based dish, packed with filling fiber and protein and comes together in about 30 minutes. Be sure to save any leftovers — these noodles are just as good served cold or at room temperature, notes Wolf.

332,This Trini-Chinese chicken is the cure for dinnertime doldrums,"You can find versions of this dish all over Trinidad and Tobago, a taste of that nation's diversity of culture and commitment to the delicious. The skin is fried into a lacquered mahogany. The meat beneath it tastes of five-spice, ginger and soy and is generally accompanied by the hum of oyster sauce mixed with the zing of the pickled Scotch bonnet pepper sauce that is seemingly omnipresent on the island's tables. Do not stint on the lime used in the marinade. It offers a tartness that helps cut the saltiness of the soy.

TRINI-CHINESE CHICKEN

Ingredients

8 to 10 chicken thighs, legs, and wings (about 3 pounds total)

2 tablespoons Chinese five-spice powder

3 or 4 limes

3 tablespoons soy sauce

One 2-inch knob fresh ginger, peeled and minced

¹/₂ cup neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed

2 tablespoons sesame oil

¹/₂ cup oyster sauce

1 to 3 tablespoons Scotch bonnet pepper sauce, such as Matouk’s

Freshly ground black pepper

¹/₄ cup chopped green scallions

Directions

In a large nonreactive bowl, toss the chicken with the five-spice powder, then with the juice of 2 of the limes, the soy sauce, and ginger. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to a full day. Combine the oils in a large skillet set over medium-high heat. There should be at least 1/4 inch of oil in the pan. When the oil is hot, remove the chicken from the marinade, allowing the excess marinade to drip back into the bowl, and fry, in batches if necessary to not crowd the pan, turning the pieces frequently, until well browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce. Combine the oyster sauce, 1 tablespoon of the hot pepper sauce, and the juice of the third lime and stir to combine. Adjust the seasonings with more hot sauce, lime juice, and black pepper to taste. Garnish with the scallions and serve with white or fried rice, with a drizzle of the sauce over each piece of chicken and the remaining sauce on the side.

333,4 meatless meals your family will love,"Speaking as a cook, a parent and a member of the general population who isn't going to become vegetarian any time soon, I know that the decisions I make around eating meat need re-evaluating. Choosing animal products that are sustainable and humanely raised is one consideration we all need to focus in on. And eating less meat is another: smaller portions, more vegetarian moments in the week ... all of this can contribute to the health of our families as well as our planet and neighbors.

But, hey, no soapboxes here — just an awareness that even small changes add up on all sorts of fronts. One way to move the needle is to institute one completely vegetarian meal per week in your home, a Meatless Monday (or any day that works for you). And it doesn’t have to be on one consistent day — the point is simply to consciously make one dinner completely meat free. Whether you decide to go full vegan (no dairy, eggs, honey or anything that comes from an animal) is of course up to you.

So, yes, we know there are a lot of reasons to think more vegetarian thoughts, but if it’s not delicious and satisfying — and if you can’t sell it to your family — then all of the good intentions in the world will fizzle out pretty quickly. So, without further ado, our first collection of crowd-pleasing meatless recipes for March, one for each week in the month!

Mediterranean Lentil, Red Onion and Avocado Salad Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

If you ever thought lentil salads were boring, think again! Fresh, delicious, and so easy to make. In this salad lentils (try and get the French ones) are simply cooked, then combined with a balsamic dressing and some lightly cooked vegetables. And then the finishing touches: diced avocado, plus healthy handfuls of sliced scallions and herby fresh parsley. The colorful assortment of chopped and diced vegetables results in a lentil salad that’s a little lighter than straight lentil salads, and very varied (e.g., not at all boring) within each bite.

Instant Pot Vegetable Chili Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

The classic perfect vegetarian chili recipe, reinterpreted for the Instant Pot. It’s straightforward, it’s delicious, it’s economical, it’s just what a vegetarian chili should be. If you don’t have an Instant Pot, you can cook it in a regular slow cooker, but you will have to sauté some of the ingredients first. And you also can make it on the stove, and just let it simmer for an hour or so once all of the ingredients are in the pot. Skip the sour cream and shredded cheese at the end, or use dairy-free versions, if you are looking to keep the meal vegan.

Farrotto with Golden Beets, Mixed Herbs and Crispy Shallots Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

Farrotto is essentially risotto, but instead of being made with short grain rice (like arborio) it’s made with farro. Farro is an ancient hearty wheat grain, with a chewy texture, and it’s a good source of iron, fiber and protein. Its nutritional value makes it an excellent grain to incorporate into all kinds of dishes, particularly for vegetarians. This is another true one-pot meal.

Creamy Four Cheese Pasta Courtesy of Katie Workman/Mom100

And now for something a little decadent — reach for this gem on a day that calls for a splurge. Skipping meat is hardly a hardship when there is a vat of creamy mac and cheese taking center stage. This one is ultra velvety and lush thanks to a blend of mascarpone (Italian-style cream cheese), cheddar, Monterey Jack, and creamy goat cheese. This is kind of the Rolls Royce of mac and cheeses. Balance out all that cheese and dairy with these roasted winter vegetables with Sriracha honey glaze.

334,Winter weekends call for steak and Guinness stew,"Here is a hearty, stout-infused, and cheese-thickened stew that is excellent for serving to large crowds, essentially a British steak and kidney pie without the kidneys and piecrust. The gravy stretches nicely over buttered noodles, so three pounds of meat goes a long way. You could tip it into a baking dish and top with puff pastry or mashed potatoes if you're bound for a potluck; you could definitely make a batch and put it in the freezer against the knowledge that some day you're going to need it to feed a crowd on the quick. It delivers big, big flavor whenever it's served. Served with buttered noodles or mashed potatoes — something starchy and rich.

Ingredients

4 tablespoons (¹/₂ stick) unsalted butter

2 large red onions, peeled and diced

4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

2 carrots, peeled and chopped

2 celery stalks, trimmed and chopped

10 button mushrooms, trimmed and sliced

3 pounds brisket (preferably second cut) or stew meat, chopped into bite-size pieces

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 fresh rosemary sprig

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

Two, 12-ounce cans stout

8 ounces grated cheddar cheese

Preparation

Heat the oven to 375°F. In a large, oven-safe pan fitted with a lid, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-low heat. When the butter melts and begins to foam, add the onions and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until soft, about 10 minutes. Add the carrots, celery, mushrooms, and the remaining 2 tablespoons butter and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms are dark in color and the moisture released by them has evaporated, about 15 minutes. Season the beef pieces all over with salt and pepper. Add the beef and rosemary to the pan, then sprinkle the flour over them and cook over high heat, stirring often, for about 5 minutes. Add enough Guinness just to cover the beef. Cover the pan and put it in the oven for 1 1/2 hours. Remove from the oven and stir. Return to the oven and cook for 1 hour more. If the sauce remains thin, set the pot over medium-low heat, remove the lid, and reduce the liquid. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Fold in the cheese and stir to combine.

335,Healthy 30-minute meals: Broccoli mac and cheese,"We made it through January — and the tightened-up diet season devoid of alcohol and refined carbs. Now we’re ready to introduce some of our favorite meals back into rotation, without going off the deep-end and undoing a month of hard work.

For those nights when we decide to loosen the reigns a bit, lightened-up comfort food recipes that will satisfy cravings are key. Case in point: this baked broccoli mac and cheese from registered dietitian Alix Turoff's latest book, ""Lose Your Belly Fat Cookbook: A Jumpstart Plan and 75 Delicious Recipes for Weight Loss"". The recipe gets a healthy twist with high-protein chickpea pasta, skim milk and reduced-fat cheese, and even manages to sneak some veggies in. Perhaps the best news, you can have it on the table in 35 minutes flat, which is my kind of weeknight dinner.

Another upside? You’d be hard pressed to find someone who doesn’t like mac and cheese. From your picky toddler, to your spouse, to your best friend — the gooey, carby dish gets two thumbs up regardless who you’re sharing the dinner table with.

Baked Broccoli Mac and Cheese

Servings: 6

Total cook time: 35 minutes

Ingredients

12 ounces chickpea pasta (dry)

1 ½ tbsp butter

¼ cup yellow onion (minced)

¼ cup flour

2 cups skim milk (or milk of choice)

1 cup chicken broth (or vegetable broth)

8 ounces reduced fat cheddar cheese (~2 cups shredded)

¼ tsp sea salt and black pepper (to taste)

12 ounces broccoli florets (pre-cut)

2 tbsps Parmigiano Reggiano

¼ cup bread crumbs (seasoned)

Nonstick cooking spray

Preparation

Cook pasta and broccoli together in a large pot of salted water, according to package directions for al dente (or slightly under cook 2-3 minutes). Spray a baking dish with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large skillet, melt butter. Add onion and cook over low heat about 2 minutes, add flour and cook another minute, or until the flour is golden and well combined. Add milk and chicken broth and whisk, raising heat to medium-high until it comes to a boil; cook ~5 minutes or until the sauce becomes smooth and thick. Season with salt and pepper. Once the sauce is thick, remove from heat, add cheese and mix well until cheese is melted. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, add cooked macaroni and broccoli and mix well. Pour into prepared baking dish. Top with grated cheese and breadcrumbs. Spray a little more cooking spray on top. Bake for 15-20 minutes, then broil for a few minutes to get the breadcrumbs golden.

336,Taqueria-style fish tacos with salsa and lime crema,"The mother recipe is simple: Cook fish, serve in a taco. You can grill the fish. You can fry it. Whatever method you use can yield fish worth folding into a tortilla. Here, though, is a bespoke fish taco recipe I ginned up after watching a bunch of chefs cook fish fillets for a lot longer on one side than another, seeing what a marvelous crust they got in return. Fluke works great if you're in the Northeast. But any firm white fish will do, including tilapia, the farmed fish protein that many street corner fish taco joints use really well. Deploy a simple salsa and lime-flecked crema topping to accompany the fish, however you end up cooking it.

Ingredients

For the salsa

2 medium tomatoes, seeded and finely chopped

1 small red onion, peeled and diced

1 clove garlic, peeled and minced

¹/₂ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro

1 jalapeño pepper, halved lengthwise, seeded, and cut crosswise into half-moons (optional)

Kosher salt

For the crema

¹/₄ cup mayonnaise

¹/₂ cup sour cream

1 lime, cut in half

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

1 tablespoon canned chipotle pepper, finely chopped (optional)

For the fish

1 cup all-purpose flour

1 tablespoon chili powder

1 ¹/₂ teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for finishing

1 ¹/₂ teaspoons freshly ground black pepper

1 cup whole milk

2 pounds flounder or any firm white-fleshed fish, cut across the grain of the flesh into strips about ¹/₂ inch wide by 3 inches long

¹/₂ cup peanut oil, plus a splash more for greasing the pan

2 tablespoons unsalted butter

Twenty-four 6-inch fresh corn tortillas

2 to 3 cups shredded green cabbage

Preparation

Make the salsa. In a medium bowl, combine the tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeño, if using. Add salt to taste. Make the crema. In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise and sour cream until combined. Season to taste with the juice of the halved lime, the salt, the black pepper, and the chipotle, if using. Prepare the fish. In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Pour the milk into another medium bowl and place the fish in it. Pour the peanut oil into a 12-inch frying pan and place over medium-high heat until it shimmers and is about to smoke. Remove the fish pieces from the milk bath and dredge them lightly through the flour mixture, shaking to remove excess. Add the butter to the pan. Place some fish pieces in the oil, without crowding them, and cook until deep golden brown on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn carefully and cook for 1 minute more. Remove to a warmed, paper towel–lined plate and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with the remaining fish. Meanwhile, lightly grease a skillet with a drizzle of oil and set over medium heat. Heat the tortillas, one or two at a time, until they are soft and hot. Keep them warm, wrapped in a dish towel if you don’t have a tortilla warmer. Fill each tortilla with 3 pieces of fish, browned side up, followed by the tomato salsa and a pinch of cabbage. Drizzle with the crema. Serve 1 or 2 tacos per person, with lime wedges and hot sauce, such as Tapatío or Frank's, on the side.

337,How to make crispy chicken parmesan in your air fryer,"Crispy and gooey when done right, but too often oily and soggy, chicken parmesan seemed an ideal candidate for the air fryer. We could eliminate the greasy pan frying and simplify this multistep dish. But we soon learned that, without a pan of hot oil, the coating of crunchy panko bread crumbs refused to brown. This was easily fixed: Pretoasting the panko in the microwave with a bit of olive oil turned it richly golden. To streamline the breading process, we whisked the flour and egg together, adding garlic powder and dried oregano for flavor. We dipped our chicken in this mixture and then pressed it in the toasted panko that we'd combined with grated parmesan for an extra hit of cheesiness and an even crunchier texture. A short stint in the air fryer gave us chicken that was juicy inside and crunchy outside. We sprinkled on shredded mozzarella and cooked the cutlets just long enough to melt the cheese. A little warmed pasta sauce poured over the top kept our recipe simple and avoided soggy cutlets. Chopped basil added a fresh finish.

Serves 2

Cook Time: 13 minutes

Total Time: 45 minutes

Serve with pasta, if desired.

¾ cup panko bread crumbs

2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese

1 large egg

1 tablespoon all-purpose flour

¾ teaspoon garlic powder

½ teaspoon dried oregano

Salt and pepper

2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, trimmed

2 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (½ cup)

¼ cup jarred marinara sauce, warmed

2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil

Toss panko with oil in bowl until evenly coated. Microwave, stirring frequently, until light golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer to shallow dish, let cool slightly, then stir in Parmesan. Whisk egg, flour, garlic powder, oregano, ⅛ teaspoon salt, and ⅛ teaspoon pepper together in second shallow dish. Pound chicken to uniform thickness as needed. Pat dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Working with 1 breast at a time, dredge in egg mixture, letting excess drip off, then coat with panko mixture, pressing gently to adhere. Lightly spray base of air-fryer basket with vegetable oil spray. Arrange breasts in prepared basket, spaced evenly apart, alternating ends. Place basket in air fryer and set temperature to 400 degrees. Cook until chicken is crispy and registers 160 degrees, 12 to 16 minutes, flipping and rotating breasts halfway through cooking. Sprinkle chicken with mozzarella. Return basket to air fryer and cook until cheese is melted, about 1 minute. Transfer chicken to individual serving plates. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons warm marinara sauce and sprinkle with basil. Serve.

338,"These air fryer Brussels sprouts make the perfect healthy snack, appetizer or side dish","Fried Brussels sprouts have become a menu staple — and for good reason. The tiny cabbages caramelize and crisp while maintaining enough structure to work as a dipping vessel. Of course, deep-frying them is something of a project and doesn't yield the healthiest results. We wanted to see if we could use the air fryer to make “fried” Brussels sprouts that kept their virtuous qualities but tasted as decadent as their deep-fried counterparts. Our first attempts were promising but not perfect. Since we usually achieve crispiness (when not frying) by using a very hot oven, we tossed the Brussels sprouts in a little oil and roasted them in the air fryer at 400 degrees. They crisped up quickly but tasted raw inside: The air fryer was doing too good a job at browning. We tried adding a splash of water before cooking the sprouts, hoping the resulting steam might soften them faster, but no luck. The solution turned out to be more obvious: Lowering the heat to 350 degrees gave the sprouts time to soften on the inside while the outside crisped. The results mimicked the deep-fried sprouts so well that we were inspired to create a version with another beloved fried vegetable: crispy shallots.

Serves 4

Cook Time: 20 minutes

Total Time: 25 minutes

The Brussels sprouts are delicious with just a squeeze of lemon, but irresistible with Lemon-Chive Dipping Sauce (recipe follows). If you are buying loose Brussels sprouts, select those that are about 1½ inches long. Quarter Brussels sprouts longer than 2½ inches.

1 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Salt and pepper

Lemon wedges

Toss Brussels sprouts with oil, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ⅛ teaspoon pepper in bowl; transfer to air-fryer basket. Place basket in air fryer and set temperature to 350 degrees. Cook Brussels sprouts until tender, well browned, and crispy, 20 to 25 minutes, tossing halfway through cooking. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with lemon wedges.

Variation

Air-Fried Brussels Sprouts with Crispy Shallots

Add 3 thinly sliced shallots to bowl with Brussels sprouts along with oil, salt, and pepper.

Lemon-Chive Dipping Sauce

Whisk ¼ cup mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon minced fresh chives, ½ teaspoon grated lemon zest plus 2 teaspoons juice, ½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce, ½ teaspoon Dijon mustard, and ¼ teaspoon garlic powder together in bowl.

339,7 hearty and easy chili recipes top chefs and food bloggers love,"Chili is one seriously popular dish: In 2018, ""chili"" was beaten only by ""cake"" in Google recipe searches in the United States. It's no wonder the stew is so popular — it's versatile, satisfying, makes great leftovers, and, with the right ingredients, it can be incredibly healthy.

But it's also easy to get stuck in a chili rut, making the same old beef or vegetarian version over and over. So we asked seven chefs and food bloggers, including Julia Turshen, Giada De Laurentiis, Martha Stewart, and Melissa Clark, to share their favorite chili recipes. Lucky for us — and you! — they delivered big time, offering up creative yet completely doable chili ideas. So if you've never thought of adding black-eyed peas or a dash of cocoa powder to your chili, now's the time, whether you're looking for the perfect chili for a party or you simply need a new idea for dinner tonight.

Giada De Laurentiis' Sweet Potato Chili Courtesy of Giadzy.com

""This chili is my favorite because it comes together in under an hour yet has all the flavor of a chili that has been slow simmered all day,"" says Giada De Laurentiis, who shared this beef, bean, and sweet potato chili recipe from her site Giadzy. ""This is thanks to the three different chilies and an added layer of sweetness from nutritious sweet potatoes. Added bonus: It's rich in protein while only using half the amount of meat so it leaves you full but not needing a nap.""

""This chili is the ultimate crowd-friendly, make-ahead dish when you have loved ones over,"" says Julia Turshen, the author of numerous cookbooks, including ""Feed the Resistance"", ""Small Victories"" and ""Now & Again"", as well as the founder of Equity at the Table. ""I always make the chili the day before (it tastes even better that way) and then serve the toppings (sour cream, grated cheese, avocado and scallions) on the side so everyone can mix and match to their liking. I love using black-eyed peas because they're a little unexpected in chili, but their nutty flavor and creamy texture goes beautifully, plus they're a nod to the foodways of the South, which also inspired the cast-iron cornbread that I like to serve with the chili. But by all means use whatever type of bean you love and already have in your cupboard!""

Martha Stewart's Pressure-Cooker Pork and Pinto-Bean Chili Photo: Marcus Nilsson

“Broiler-charred poblano chiles and a liberal dose of cumin give this hearty stew a wonderful smokiness,"" says Martha Stewart, who shared this Instant Pot-ready chili recipe from her book ""Martha Stewart's Pressure Cooker."" Stewart adds, ""Pork shoulder is an ideal cut for the pressure cooker — cubes are browned and braised for the chili base here. Serve with wedges of cornbread for a warming fall supper or the ultimate game-day entree.”

Chungah Rhee's Quinoa Chili Chungah Rhee

""This is an all-time favorite, especially during the cold winter months,"" says the blogger behind Damn Delicious, Chungah Rhee, who shared this healthy recipe from her new cookbook ""Damn Delicious Meal Prep."" Rhee adds, ""It's vegetarian, protein-packed, and the perfect bowl of comfort food that you can eat guilt-free! It's truly a win-win for all.""

Melissa Clark's Easy Weeknight Pressure-Cooker Chili Christopher Testani

When you have only 30 minutes to put together dinner yet still want something hearty, try this recipe from The New York Times contributor and cookbook author Melissa Clark. The recipe, from Clark's new pressure-cooker cookbook ""Comfort in an Instant"" calls for ground pork or beef — your choice! — plus pinto or kidney beans and easy to find spices, including chili powder and cumin. After a quick saute of the meat and vegetables, the pressure cooker completes the work of turning a few staples into an outstanding dinner.

Kelly Senyei's Slow-Cooker Chicken Chili Kelly Senyei

""When it comes to a hearty meal-in-a-bowl, it doesn't get much better than chili,"" says Kelly Senyei, who shared this recipe from her popular blog Just a Taste. "" I've lightened up this protein-packed comfort food by swapping beef for chicken and loading up on extra beans and plenty of spices (read: flavor, not fat). Tossing everything into the slow cooker takes the stress out of meal time and prevents those last-minute greasy takeout orders. Best of all, this chicken chili tastes just as great (if not better) on day two, so you'll be eating healthy all week long.""

Nik Sharma's Cocoa-Spiced Bean and Lentil Chili NIK SHARMA / Nik Sharma

Is it a soup, a stew or a chili? You won't care what it's called once you try this legume-filled dish, which gets a wonderful depth of flavor from cocoa powder. ""It was during my years spent in grad school in Cincinnati that I first got introduced to chili,"" says Nik Sharma, a blogger, San Francisco Chronicle columnist and author of the cookbook ""Season."" He adds, ""What made it special was their use of unsweetened cocoa, which helps to boost the savoriness of the dish."" Sharma took inspiration from his Cincinnati chili experiences when developing this robust vegetarian stew, which is made with creamy lentils, split peas and beans. A garnish of fresh herbs and dollop of Greek yogurt brighten the flavors and makes this chili even more satisfying.

342,Super Bowl recipes: Melissa Clark's Instant Pot spicy Asian chicken wings,"This recipe hits all the right notes — spicy from the hot sauce and fresh ginger, salty from the soy sauce, funky from the fish sauce, sweet from the mirin. Make sure to serve the wings as hot as your fingers can bear. As the sauce cools, it can get a little gloppy, and the wings themselves will lose some of their lovely crunch. But when served steaming hot, they are hard to stop eating — and the second one tastes even better than the first.

SPICY ASIAN CHICKEN WINGS

ACTIVE TIME: 25 MINUTES

PRESSURE COOK TIME: 3 MINUTES

TOTAL TIME: 1 HOUR 15 MINUTES

YIELD: 6 TO 8 SERVINGS

FOR THE MARINATED WINGS

2 tablespoons soy sauce

2 large garlic cloves, finely grated or minced

1/2-inch piece fresh ginger, finely grated

1/2 teaspoon kosher salt

1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

21/2 to 3 pounds chicken wings

FOR THE GLAZE

1 cup mirin

3 tablespoons Sriracha or other hot sauce

Finely grated zest and juice of 2 limes

2 tablespoons soy sauce

1 tablespoon Asian fish sauce

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

FOR FINISHING AND SERVING

Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling

1 teaspoon sesame seeds, for serving

Fresh ground black pepper, for serving

Chopped scallions or cilantro, for serving

1. Marinate the wings: In a large bowl, mix together the soy sauce, garlic, ginger, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken and toss to coat. Marinate the chicken for 30 minutes at room temperature or overnight in the refrigerator.

2. Make the glaze: Combine the mirin, Sriracha, lime zest and juice, soy sauce, fish sauce, and pepper in the pressure cooker pot. Using the sauté function, simmer the glaze, stirring frequently, until it reduces enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 8 minutes. Transfer about one-third of the glaze to a large bowl. Transfer another one-third to a small bowl. Reserve both bowls of glaze for later. Leave the last one-third of the glaze in the pot.

3. Add the chicken to the pot with the glaze, along with any liquid from the marinade bowl and 2 tablespoons water.

4. Lock the lid into place and cook on high pressure for 3 minutes. Manually release the pressure.

5. Preheat the broiler to high. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.

6. To finish using a slotted spoon or tongs, transfer the chicken wings to the glaze in the large bowl and toss well (discard any liquid still in the pressure cooker pot). Arrange the wings in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle the wings with some sesame oil (about a tablespoon or so, but you don’t have to measure it). Broil until they are crispy and browned, 2 to 4 minutes.

7. Transfer the wings to a serving platter and drizzle with the glaze from the small bowl. Garnish with the sesame seeds, pepper, and scallions. Serve hot.

343,"6 easy, delicious ways to upgrade your salad for winter","Looking for a way to nourish yourself in a tasty way this winter? While salads typically scream summer, you can easily winterize the healthy diet staple with a few simple tweaks — and be better equipped to stay on track with those health goals. Give these six delicious ideas a try.

ADD: WINTER FRUIT

Emily Kyle Nutrition

Cold temps offer so many tempting fruit offerings, including winter citrus like oranges and tangerines, as well as apples and delectably crunchy pomegranate arils. Citrus is packed with immunity-helping vitamin C, truly essential this time of year. It has the added benefit of helping you absorb plant-based iron from the veggies in your salad, too. And the beautiful red of pomegranate arils? You have health-helping antioxidants to thank for that rich color. Top a Shaved Brussels Sprout Salad with pomegranate arils, mix apples into a Sweet Cranberry and Apple Lentil Salad, or add tangerines and grapefruit to a Winter Citrus Fruit Salad. If you’re feeling adventurous, sprinkle on a little citrus zest for added flavor.

ADD: WARMING SPICES

Lively Table

“When it comes to winterizing a salad, I think of combining ingredients that are in season like pomegranates, citrus fruits, Brussels sprouts and butternut squash — and adding warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger that are reminiscent of the holidays and colder weather,” says Kara Lydon, RD, a dietitian and yoga teacher in Boston. “Wintery spices have a warm element to them, which in turn makes us perceive the food as grounding, cozy and comforting.” Roast sweet potatoes or winter squash with cinnamon, or simply season a finished salad with a dash of freshly ground nutmeg. “Cinnamon is one of the most antioxidant-packed spices in your cabinet, and it contains antimicrobial properties that may help ward off that pesky winter cold,” says Lydon. Whip up a Turkey Wild Rice Salad, a Black Rice and Purple Brussels Sprout Salad, or a Moroccan Chickpea Salad.

ADD: GRAINS

Liz's Healthy Table

Instead of pairing a salad with whole-grain bread, why not add the whole grains directly to the salad? Any grain will work, but picks with a particularly chewy texture like farro and barley work particularly well. Plus, grains add filling fiber and plenty of vitamins and minerals. “Shake up your usual summer salad by putting your indoor grill to work!” suggests Catherine Brown, a plant-based chef in Errol, New Hampshire. “Grill peppers, squash, onions and eggplant. Then dice them, add a cooked whole grain, some fresh herbs, olives, nuts or seeds, and a flavorful vinaigrette. You'll be transported back to warm summer nights!” Or combine roasted winter veggies — think parsnips, carrots and winter squash — and pair with a black or red rice, as well as orange slices. “Choose an assortment of deep colors to get a wide variety of antioxidants,” advises Brown. Embrace the season with a Kale Salad with Roasted Delicata Squash, Farro, Pistachios, and Apricots or a Grilled Summer Veg and Kamut Salad.

ADD: COOKED WINTER VEGGIES

Edwina Clark

Nothing winterizes a salad quite like roasted sweet potatoes or steamed beets. And you don’t have to serve the veggies warm. “I love adding chunky cooked veggies to salads because they offer heartiness, texture and flavor,” says Edwina Clark, RD, a dietitian in San Francisco. “They provide an additional level of complexity that's hard to achieve with raw foods alone, and they make a salad more satisfying.” When roasted, sweet potatoes offer up a sweet flavor, plus they provide bulk (think plenty of fiber!), allowing you to forgo adding grains to your salad. “Complex carbohydrates in your salad provide energy to last you until your next meal,” says Cassidy Reeser, RD, a dietitian in Athens, Georgia. As for steamed beets, “they’re an easy way to bump up the volume without adding many calories,” notes Clark. “Beets are loaded with betalain, a group of phytonutrients with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. They also offer nitrates, which have been shown to assist with blood vessel health and endurance.” Enjoy sweet potatoes in an Autumn Salad with Roasted Chicken and beets in a Beet, Orange, and Feta Salad with Creamy Mint Dressing.

“When it's frigid outside, a cold salad doesn't seem quite so refreshing,” says Rebecca Clyde, RDN, a dietitian in Salt Lake City, Utah. “Adding a heated component to your salad is a great way to warm up and also reduce food waste. You may not want to eat starting-to-wilt greens raw — but heat them up, and they're perfect.” Charred romaine and sautéed kale or spinach are all yummy additions. But the options don’t stop there. Add dried fruit like raisins or cranberries to your sauté pan, along with low-sodium broth — the fruit will plump up with moisture and deliciousness. Warm up with a Simple Sautéed Kale Salad or a Maple Roasted Squash and Seared Halloumi Cheese Salad.

ADD: NUTS

Beautiful Eats and Things

You’ll find nuts like pistachios, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts in your favorite wintery baked-good recipes. So why not toss the crunchy goodness to a winter salad, as well? “I love adding nuts to my winter salads to give them additional protein and texture,” says Andrea Mathis, RDN, a dietitian in Birmingham, Alabama. “Nuts have been linked with lowering LDL cholesterol, as well as inflammation associated with heart disease.” Go for the crunch with an Orange Pomegranate and Walnut Salad, an Italian Lupini Bean Salad with Crushed Pistachios, or a Kale and Chickpea Salad.

The weather outside this time of year can be seriously frightful for your scalp. Many people experience seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff — the medical names for a dry, flaky scalp — this time of year.

“The external air in the wintertime tends to be drier or less humid than in warmer months, which tends to have a drying effect on our skin, including the scalp,” explains Shari Hicks-Graham, MD, a dermatologist in Columbus, Ohio.

What’s more, indoor heating systems pump out dry air, so they have a similar effect on your scalp, while hot showers can also exacerbate dryness during the colder weather season, says Hicks-Graham. “Scalp dryness can turn into flakiness when we brush our hair or rub or scratch our head,” she adds.

Some people are prone to seborrheic dermatitis year-round, notes Lindsey Bordone, MD, dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center who specializes in hair disorders. That’s because this condition has a lot of different causes.

“Seborrheic dermatitis is often referred to as dandruff and can be the result of genetics, the environment, and your diet,” says Mona Mofid, MD, dermatologist at Sharp Grossmont Hospital in San Diego. “In some cases, there is an overgrowth of a yeast — malassezia — that normally lives on the skin but may be in excess.”

Not shampooing your hair enough can also cause dandruff due to the build-up of oils and skin cells on the scalp. Bordone says stress can also contribute to seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff.

While seborrheic and dandruff are essentially the same, dandruff only affects the scalp, while seborrheic dermatitis can cause skin irritation and flaking on other areas, like your ears, eyebrows, beard region and upper chest.

Luckily, you have a variety of treatment options to soothe your scalp, starting with natural solutions.

“Coconut and olive oil are very good for the scalp,” says Debra Jaliman, MD, dermatologist in New York City and author of “Skin Rules”. Coconut oil is naturally antibacterial and extremely nourishing thanks to the vitamins and essential fatty acids it contains, while olive oil is full of antioxidants that help protect the skin when applied topically. “A good trick is to apply one of those oils to the scalp overnight once a week, or even once a month, to give your scalp a hydrating treatment,” says Mofid.

Another natural remedy you can try: apple cider vinegar, which is antibacterial and anti-fungal, says Jaliman. (Just make sure to dilute it with water before putting it near your scalp.)

Beyond natural remedies, there are plenty of shampoos targeted to treat seborrheic dermatitis. “Some ingredients to look for which can help soothe a flaky scalp include ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulfide, and 2% pyrithione zinc,” says Paul Cellura, MD, dermatologist at Tribeca Skin Center in New York City. “These ingredients are contained in many of the available over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoos.” Glycolic acid, which is commonly used in facial chemical peels, can also be very effective on the scalp when used in modest amounts, says Hicks-Graham.

As for what not to do: “Avoid hair products that may be drying, such as hair sprays and shampoos with a high alcohol content,” advises Paradi Mirmirani, MD, dermatologist and director of hair disorders for Kaiser Permanente in Northern California. “The higher up on the ingredient list, the more of the product it contains.” It’s also best to steer clear of shampoos formulated for oily scalps (these are often labeled as “cleansing” or “clarifying”) because they can contain harsh ingredients that can dry out your scalp, says Mirmirani.

The best shampoos for a dry, flaky scalp

Take care of your dandruff with one of these dermatologist-approved shampoos. But keep this in mind: “If over-the-counter products fail to fully control the scalp irritation, it may be wise to pay a visit to a board-certified dermatologist for further evaluation,” says Cerulla.

Hicks-Graham is a fan of this shampoo because it has a gentle sulfate-free formula that still lathers and feels great on your hair. Xlyitol in the formula fights yeast, while salicylic acid, glycolic acid and willow bark extract exfoliate and soothe.

Coal isn’t just for those who made the naughty list this holiday season. Ths shampoo, which Cerulla likes, relies on 1 percent coal tar to ease flaking and scalp irritation associated with seborrheic dermatitis, dandruff and scalp psoriasis.

Cerulla also likes this drugstore shampoo, which is formulated with 1 percent ketoconazole to help reduce the amount of pityrosporum yeast on the scalp and cut down on inflammation, redness and scaly patches.

Powered by 2 percent pyrithione zinc to help control dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis symptoms, this shampoo is a favorite of Mohid’s because it’s both affordable and available OTC. “For people who experience seborrheic dermatitis on the face or chest it can also be used as a wash and comes in a body wash option as well,” she says.

With 1 percent pyrithione zinc and coconut oil, this shampoo offers a one-two punch against dandruff at an inexpensive price point. “This shampoo helps to nourish dry itchy scalp and also helps to relieve it from irritation,” says Jaliman. “It’s pH balanced to gently cleanse scalp and hair.”

For mild cases of seborrheic dermatitis, Bordone says an OTC dandruff shampoo like this one can be very effective. This classic formula’s star ingredient is 1 percent pyrithione zinc, which helps improve flakiness and itchiness.

Finding time to exercise in your busy day is a win, no matter what. But choosing the right gear will take your workout to the next level.

Proper footwear ensures you’re making the most of your time in the gym, allows you to move around properly and helps prevent injuries. After all, just like you wouldn’t wear flip-flops to a business meeting, you wouldn’t want to wear shoes that hold you back from giving it all in a workout. Upgrade your worn out sneakers with these picks from some of the country’s top trainers and athletes, as well as everyday shoppers.

Best workout shoes for strength and conditioning

Whether you’re lifting dumbbells, using equipment, or just relying on your body weight to get stronger, cross-training workouts require a stable, steady shoe. That’s why Adam Rosante, a strength and mental performance coach, recommends this pair from Nike. “It’s the best training shoe out there,” he says. “It’s super durable, has great lateral stability, and provides the perfect platform for allowing your feet to fire and function naturally.”

Best women's shoes for power walking

With hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon, these breathable shoes were clearly made for walking. One customer reported that she comfortably walked 15 to 20 miles the first time she wore them, adding that they “defied the laws of physics.” “My feet have never felt lighter with shoes on,” she said.

If you love a walking workout, check out this round up of the best, most supportive walking shoes on the market.

Best women's shoes for trail running

When you take your runs onto the trails, extra cushioning is the name of the game. These lightweight but supportive shoes make off-road running so much easier, and the tread provides plenty of traction. Trail runner Tim Freriks says this brand is always his top pick: “Whether I’m on a long run through the mountains or in the Grand Canyon, I know that I'm wearing the lightest shoe without sacrificing cushion and traction.”

Best women's socks for barre classes

These ballet-inspired workout classes don’t require shoes, but you want to wear a pair of non-slip socks to help you get a better grip on the barre and on the floor. These are a top-rated option on Amazon. Reviewers call them “cute and comfortable” and report that the quality continues to hold up after many washes.

Best women's shoes for Crossfit workouts

If you’re heading to the “box” (CrossFit-speak for the gym), you’ll want to have the right shoe for your WOD (workout of the day).

This is the first-ever CrossFit shoe built specifically for women, featuring a more slender shape and narrow toe box designed specifically to suit a woman’s foot. It's also been tested and approved by CrossFit Games athletes like Chyna Cho.

“This is the lightest shoe I’ve trained in from Reebok, and translates into real-life clothing,” she says. “If I were to travel at the airport, I would totally rock this shoe and not feel like a gym rat. And they hold up so well.”

Best women's shoes for HIIT classes

For the full-body functional exercises involved in high-intensity interval training (or HIIT) classes, you want a shoe that’s flexible with a thin, flat sole and a light tread, explains Bergen Wheeler, creator of Exhale Spa’s Core Fusion HIIT classes. This pair will help you feel your feet on the ground, while giving you plenty of stability for high-intensity moves. Bonus: These come in an almost endless array of colors.

Best indoor spin women's shoes

Crush your next indoor cycling class with this pair of clip-in shoes. Designed for recreational riders, the fiberglass-reinforced sole helps boost your power output, while the synthetic leather upper enhances strength and stability. Amazon customers say they fit true to size and are “so comfy right out of the box.”

Best women's shoes for yoga

Sanuk makes shoes “for the journey to your happy place.” And if yoga class is your happy place, these sandals are the perfect thing to wear on your way there. These slip on and off easily, and the rubber soles — made out of real yoga mat material — provide enough support if you have a longer walk to class. One reviewer reports: “I wore these for the first time on an all-day walk around San Francisco. There was no break-in time needed. They handled the hills great.”

Best women's shoes for dance classes

Moving your body to Beyonce’s latest track is definitely a fun ways to break a sweat. But with all the jumping and plyometric moves in dance cardio classes, you need a shoe that’s suited for shock absorption, explains Katia Pryce, founder and creator of DanceBody. “The right shoe is super important for this type of workout because of the lateral movement and constant footwork,” she says. These Asics are “by far” the best shoe she’s found, and she recommends them to all her clients.

Best workout shoes for running

Long runs require shoes with a mix of soft cushioning with plenty of “springiness,” and these kicks deliver the perfect combination. Maegan Krifchin, a professional distance runner, says she prefers this style for their “just right” feeling: “They hug my feet but have enough give, support me but don't over-correct, and won't weigh me down,” she says. “I've gone through at least 24 pairs of Wave Riders since I started running in them!”

This lightweight, neutral shoe also provides an ideal amount of flexibility and cushioning for longer runs. Celebrity trainer Kira Stokes laces these up whenever she’s running more than five miles. “This is a neutral shoe that still allows me to feel the road beneath my feet,” she says. “They also has a nice wide toe box to allow some breathing room.”

Best women's workout shoe for any cardio

If your workouts involve a little bit of everything, this shoe is for you. Stokes likes to include some high-intensity training moves into her outdoor runs, and this pair stands up to all her cross-training needs. “This is a supportive, low profile shoe that provides just the right amount of cushioning, which allows you to maintain stability while moving in different directions,” she says.

346,Want to live like a Scandinavian? Here's how to bring 'hygge' into your home,"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices. If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

With endless gray days and perpetual piles of snow, making the best of winter can seem a monumental task. But Scandinavians seem to have it figured out. They live in line with the idea of “hygge,” a Danish/Norwegian word that loosely translates to a feeling of coziness.

The first things that comes to mind when Americans think of “cozy” typically include soft blankets, warm slippers, and a roaring fire (or scented candles, in a pinch). But while all of those items play a role in the concept of “hygge,” that’s not all it’s about.

What typically gets lost in translation is the fact that hygge also revolves around kinship, nature and simplicity. “In essence, the world of Nordic hygge is about getting back to basics, prioritizing what’s important, and simplifying your life,” explains Signe Johansen, author of ""How to Hygge: Nordic Secrets to a Happy Life.""

In Nordic culture, hygge has just as much to do with getting out into nature as it does with getting cozy on the couch. “What is distinctively Nordic is the freedom to roam in nature at any time of year, a right that is considered sacrosanct across the region,” Johansen writes. In their philosophy, there’s no such thing as bad weather — only bad clothing. (Learn more about how to dress for winter weather here.)

They consider time spent outdoors to have profound therapeutic benefits. In fact, it’s one of three keys to the Norwegian way of life, along with “cabin porn” and an addiction to coffee, Johansen explains. The hygge lifestyle also centers on conviviality. Spending time with family, friends and loved ones (preferably around a fire or a candlelit dinner table, of course) is another crucial element of hygge that often gets overlooked.

Finally, Scandinavian design didn’t gain its worldwide reputation (hej, Ikea!) by accident. Their simplistic, minimalist yet comfortable style is another tenet of the hygge philosophy. First step is simplifying. Get rid of what’s not working, Johansen suggests. Try the “Konmari” method, popularized by Marie Kondo’s book, ""The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up"": If it doesn’t “spark joy,” get rid of, sell, or donate it.

Next, bring in home design pieces that enhance the “hygge-ness” of your home. Think: soft furnishings and textiles — cozy throws, sheepskins and cushions in unusual or graphic prints; plants that bring nature’s hygge indoors; and of course, plenty of candles. “You can never have too many candles,” Johansen writes.

Bearing all of this in mind, we created a list of wonderful products that can help you build a true hygge lifestyle of your own, no matter where you live.

Editor's note: In the process of reviewing and updating our articles, we sometimes find that previously recommended products are outdated. As a result, we've updated this piece with newer models of the products the experts recommended below.

Scratching your head about what to get your favorite cook? We turned to some of the nation’s top food pros for their favorite gift ideas. Every pick on the list makes healthy cooking fun, fast and full of flavor, so you know each one sends a thoughtful message to friends and family on your holiday gift list. To accompany your gift, consider picking up one of our pros’ cookbooks (and cookbooks that are fall- and winter-perfect) to provide some ideas to put the new gadget to work.

This tool is a must-have in every kitchen! Katie Higgins, the healthy food blogger behind Chocolate Covered Katie, recommends this Cuisinart model. “I use this food processor to dice carrots or zucchini, shred sweet potatoes for hash browns, blend shredded coconut into butter, and to make my favorite Black Bean Brownies. I much prefer a food processor over a blender, because I find it more evenly processes all ingredients thanks to the larger surface area,” she says.

Health-supportive chef and recipe developer Danielle Krupa recommends a smaller version, Cuisinart Mini-Prep Food Processor. “It makes whipping up healthy items like hummus, fresh salsa, pesto, nut butters, energy bites, homemade baby purées and more a cinch. Plus, it’s affordable, comes in a variety of colors, is easy to clean and takes up very little kitchen space,” she says.

For cutting the perfect, evenly sliced veggies like a pro chef, nothing beats a mandolin slicer. “My absolute favorite utensil is a mandolin slicer” says Eden Grinshpan, co-founder and executive chef of DEZ, and host of Top Chef Canada, who recommends the Benriner Mandolin Slicer. “I always have a big salad on my table and it just cuts the veggies so beautifully.” A mandolin slicer makes it so easy to make gorgeous salads, which Grinshpan says encourages her to eat them more. “They're so inexpensive and a great gift!” she notes.

This versatile tool does more than create the perfect salad veggies. Ellie Krieger, RD, host of Ellie's Real Good Food on Public Television and two-time James Beard award winning cookbook author, uses hers to create nutritious chips. “My favorite healthy cooking gadget is this mandoline slicer that has various blades and a safety holder to protect your hand when slicing. It's ideal for turning fruits and vegetables — like potatoes, zucchini, apples and pear — into crisp (healthful) chips in the oven.”

Though luxe gifts may be alluring, chefs prize simple gadgets, too. Chloe Coscarelli, vegan chef and author of ""CHLOE FLAVOR"", recommends this mini offset spatula. “This tool is small but mighty, and it's less than $5.00, which makes it the perfect stocking stuffer!” she says. Coscarelli explains what makes this gift so great: “It allows for perfect wrist action whether you're spreading avocado on toast or frosting on cupcakes. I've even frosted an entire wedding cake with it. Oh, and you can never have too many because they tend to get lost!”

Any home cook will appreciate this multi-tasking tool. “It’s great for pureeing vegetable or lentil soups right in the pot, making homemade sauces, salad dressings, and more,” says Chef Jerran Boyer of Health Nut Chefs, who recommends this Cuisinart hand blender. “It’s one of the best tools a chef or home cook can have in their kitchen!”

If the cook on your gift list doesn’t already have this jack-of-all-trades, you’re going to want to grab one of these popular appliances. Among the various models, Dana Angelo White, RD, author of the ""Healthy Instant Pot Cookbook"" and the ""Healthy Air Fryer Cookbook"", suggests the Instant Pot 6-QT Duo Plus 60 or the slightly older and lower-priced Instant Pot 6-Qt Duo 60.

“Pressure cooking prepares food quickly and conveniently, plus the high pressure also helps retain nutrients,” says White, who praises the Instant Pot’s versatility. “You can also sauté, slow cook and bake (yes, bake) in the Instant Pot.” According to White, the 6-QT version is the perfect size for making large batches of soup, chili, pulled pork and pasta as well as lightened up desserts like cheesecake, poached pears and crème brulee. And if the person on your gift list is into #mealprep, the Instant Pot will come in handy. “It’s my secret weapon for healthy meal prep,” says White. “I make bulk batches of oatmeal, hard cooked eggs, sweet potatoes, brown rice, beans and Greek yogurt for the week ahead.”

White is also a fan of the air fryer. “Which air fryer you choose really depends on how many people you’re cooking for,” she notes. If you’re gifting an air fryer to a couple, White recommends the Phillips Viva. “It’s a great basic and affordable model and perfect for cooking for two.” For larger families, she suggests the Phillips Avance XL; for the cook who entertains, there’s even an XXL model.

“The biggest secret about air fryers is just how useful they can be for all kinds of cooking. Of course, there’s the appeal of lighter, non-fried versions of chicken wings and fish sticks, but you can also make egg sandwiches, shrimp scampi and spiced nuts,” explains White. “Vegetable dishes, like glazed carrots, kale chips, and stuffed mushrooms are some of the recipes I make the most,” she says. According to White, the air fryer acts like a mini convention oven, circulating hot air around the food, leaving it evenly cooked and crispy on all sides. That means that recipes that typically call for a ton of oil often need none (or a couple of teaspoons at the most) so the calorie savings can really stack up!

Here’s another small but mighty must-have for the healthy home cook in your life. “I use the Microplane zester for grating everything from garlic and ginger, to lime, orange, nutmeg and dried lime,” says Najmieh Batmanglij, whose newest cookbook, ""Cooking in Iran: Regional Recipes and Kitchen Secrets"" was just named one of 2018’s best cookbooks by The New York Times. “I’ve also used the gadget for some unexpected ingredients, like goat cheese, cooked potatoes, tomatoes and cucumber for my famous yogurt soup,” she adds. According to Bagmanglij, the zester is an easy way to add flare to a variety of dishes. She recommends the Microplane 40020 Classic Zester/Grater, which has a long, easy-to-hold handle.

This luxury appliance is on every home cook’s wish list. Genevieve Ko, the author of ""Better Baking: Wholesome Ingredients, Delicious Desserts"" explains why: “Because a stand mixer makes baking so easy, I never have to buy store-bought treats, which are loaded with a lot more sugar than I like and, sometimes, mystery ingredients that can't possibly be good for anybody. Homemade is always better for you than store-bought because you know exactly what's going into the goodies. Plus, they taste better!” Ko’s pro pick is the KitchenAid stand mixer. “I have both the smaller tilt head one, as well as the larger bowl lift one. During this busy baking season, I often have both running at the same time!” Ko also recommends the pasta maker attachment, which makes a great gift for cooks whose kitchens are already stocked with this workhorse. “It’s great for simple homemade pasta, but also works for rolling out thin, sturdy cracker or cookie dough,” she says.

According to Sammi Haber Brondo, MS RD, author of ""The Essential Vegetable Cookbook"", a blender makes the perfect gift. “Blenders are one of my favorite, must-have kitchen tools. They're extremely versatile and can be used in so many different, easy recipes. Aside from smoothies, you can puree roasted veggies with broth to make soup, mix ingredients (like banana, oats and eggs) for healthy pancakes, or even mix brownie ingredients to bake brownies,” she says. Her choice: The Magic Bullet because it's inexpensive, easy to usenand easy to clean. A nice insulated, reusable water bottle can keep smoothies cool for hours and is a stocking stuffer to go alongside the Magic Bullet.

Cookbook author Melissa d'Arabian suggests a spiralizer for any home cook who doesn’t have one. “An inexpensive one is a great gift because it's low-pressure. Super fancy models require an investment of time as well as trial and error. But an inexpensive model just begs to be tried out with a zucchini right away,” she explains. D’Arabian has this gift idea for someone special on your list: “Give the spiralizer plus a few jars of high-quality pasta sauces.”

Finding the perfect gift for a fitness fanatic (like a new fitness or health tracker) can be a difficult proposition. Whether it’s running, cycling, yoga or tennis, athletes take their craft seriously — and often have seriously specific preferences for everything from gear to accessories.

So we saved you the anguish of blindly wandering around a sporting goods store by rounding up a slew of incredible, covetable and (most importantly!) highly-rated fitness gifts. From smart water bottles to the best fitness watch, these are our 19 favorite items, all designed to help get your gym-goer giftee into high-gear (or get a newbie started on the right foot).

Best fitness and wearable tech gifts

Headphones can make or break a workout (who hasn't had the frustration of having them fall out, get tangled or run out of battery in the middle of a workout?). Specifically designed for strenuous activity, these popular Bluetooth wireless headphones are both sweat- and water- resistant, have a six-hour battery-charge life, stay securely in place during rigorous workouts and respond to voice prompts.

Give the gift of boutique fitness to friends who love trying new workout trends — from running clubs to spin classes and strength training classes — but are less enthusiastic about shelling out the chunk of change for a class. Connected to more than 10,000 fitness studios in over 50 major cities globally, there's likely to be a Classpass hub near you (or one you can try while traveling!). With gift cards available in electronic form (and sent right to the recipients inbox) you can choose whatever amount you’d like to give (and get it there STAT if you're running low on time to send a gift).

From automatically recognizing and tracking half a dozen exercises to keeping up with more than 30 others, Samsung's latest Galaxy Watch Active2 is a great gift for any tech-forward person who cares about their fitness. It works with all Android smartphones, iPhones, and Samsung smartphones. And this watch is packed with features and capabilities: Bluetooth connectivity for music and media, water resistance allowing it to be submerged up to 50 meters, built-in microphone and speakers for phone calls, interchangeable bands for personal customization and more.

Opting for a digital scale will make keeping track of your weight much easier. Step on and step off, and led t he scale do all the work. It calibrates automatically and a backlit LCD display makes it very easy to read. Want to have your scale automatically keep track of your numbers? Consider Etekcity's highly-rated smart digital scale.

When it comes to your office, sitting down creates some requirements to keep you healthy and out of pain. One thing you can do to get some movement into an otherwise motionless workday is desk fitness. And to that, the highly-rated Cubii Pro under-desk elliptical is a good start. It provides a low-impact workout for you at your desk (or at home) with smooth gearing that stays quiet so it won't bother your coworkers. On top of that, Bluetooth connectivity mean you can connect it to your smartphone and keep track of your workouts, routines and achievements.

Personal trainers can run you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars — which is why the person on your list with lofty fitness goals in the new year is going to appreciate you for gifting them an annual subscription to Aaptiv. The app will give them unlimited access to thousands of workouts and programs, created and guided by certified trainers. All they need to do is download the app, enter their goals, pick the type of exercise they are looking for that day (from running, to boxing, to yoga and meditation) based on length, intensity and music type, and a trainer will guide them step-by-step through the workout. The app brings personal training to them, wherever they are — whether it's in the gym, outside on a trail or in their living room.

Best fitness clothes, shoes, and accessories to gift

For running aficionados, it can be difficult to find a run-belt that’s both practical and comfortable. You want something that's big enough for the essentials but not so bulky it will interfere with workouts. Available in a variety of colors, the FlipBelt fits the bill, featuring a lightweight zipper pocket that goes all the way around the waist in slim, snug fit. With four belt openings, the pocket is large enough to hold large-format iPhones and Android smartphones without moving or jiggling, and is also useful for those requiring something to hold non-workout essentials like insulin pumps, lip balm or an ID.

You don't need to be into fitness to enjoy a good pair of winter gloves, especially when they allow you to use your devices with specially-designed fabric at the fingertips. This pair from Cevapro are made out of a wool-lycra blend and designed to be wind- and water-proof. For runners and cyclists, gloves that keep their fingers from freezing over is a must. These are designed to keep your digits warm at up to minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit.

These cropped leggings from the workout brand Lululemon feature a zip-free waistband pocket large enough to store a cell phone, keys or small accessories. Great for a variety of workouts, the high-rise fit features zoned compression — meaning everything stays comfortably and flatteringly tucked in throughout abs, hips, butt and thighs — as well as moisture-wicking, four-way fabric that stays cool and won’t shrink.

The Glycerin's Double Jacquard Mesh upper is designed to keep things breathable, flexible, and stable. That latter feature is a strong feature of the Glycerins, their neutral support type allowing for maximum cushion and specially designed pressure points in the show are built to absorb impact and disperse it away from your foot. Cindi Binder, a footwear expert at Healthy Feet at Canyon Ranch, chose a similar Brooks brand shoe to recommend in BETTER's guide to walking shoes and sneakers for women.

The soft fabric of the Flex Sport Bra is combined with high-impact and moisture-wicking features to give you a fitness bra that's very supportive and comfortable. The cups are molded and seam-free and a customized support mechanism allows you to choose how and where you want to the bra to keep everything in place. On top of that, it's designed with Compression and Encapsulation Tech, which is what SHEFIT calls the tech behind the bra's smooth appearance and flattering shaping properties. The fabric stretches four ways, too, and internal mesh reduces bounce to keep you comfortable while you're working out.

SAXX has something few underwear companies can boast: a specialized patent on a new way to stay comfortable all day, whether you're working out or not. It's called the Ballpark Pouch, and it keeps everything down there separated. Shaped like a hammock, it's compartmentalized at the groin. With breathable and stretchable properties, the Kinetic model is designed with 4-way stretch fabric and quick-drying, odor-resisting and supporting properties. Other models of SAXX underwear cover most people's needs, from all-day fits to travel-perfect pairs and more intense fitness models.

These sweat-wicking and lightweight shorts are a great fit for your guy’s athletic arsenal: They feature a T-shirt loop (for easy storage when he gets hot during summer workouts), a zippered pocket to store cards and cash, an interior key catch, side vents and a mesh back yoke panel for extra breathability, and an anti-chafe liner. They also come in seven colors and patterns to match your man's personality, some of which come with reflective designs for those late-night runs.

Best fitness equipment to gift

It's hard to perfectly recreate gym offerings at-home or in the office, but customizable dumbbells are a great start. This pair from Bowflex, the SelectTech 552, allows you to adjust each dumbbell from five to 52.5 pounds — and for the first 25 pounds, you can adjust in 2.5-pound increments to get a truly personal weight for your goals. From the versatility of a well-designed product to a 4.7-star average rating from more than 4,800 reviewers, this is a great gift for many types of fitness-forward people.

For the golfers on your list: This is one of the best golf swing analyzers, according to experts like Golf Digest. Blast attaches to your grip and focuses on the timing of your stroke through analysis, coaching, communication and management tools. A Smart Video Capture records videos of the swing, allowing golfers to target metrics such as stroke timing and tempo, and the tracker pairs with your phone, charging wirelessly.

The yogi on the go will love being able to leave the bulky mat (which typically weights 3.1 kg) at home and toss this eco-friendly, lightweight version (that weighs 1.1 kilograms) into their gym bag or carry-on. Its rubber bottom prevents the mat from moving, while the top is made from an ultra-absorbent synthetic suede that provides more grip the sweatier you get. Sandwiched between is a high-density cushion for joint protection and support. Every mat comes with a cheeky, suede travel bag and can be personalized with a monogram feature.

A suspension trainer system that uses your bodyweight, TRX’s straps allows for efficient, effective total body workouts anytime, any place — no bulky gym machines required. In addition to an upgrade suspension anchor, door anchor and a 35 page full-color TRX Workout Guide, you'll also get a mesh bag to take it all with you on the go, for a full-body workout that can be set up off any door, tree branch, rafter, beam or secured elevation point in just 60 seconds. A study published in the journal Human Movement Science found that doing a suspended pushup using TRX bands activated the abdominals 184 percent more than doing a standard pushup. Hello, summer body.

This stylish backpack — made from water-repellent fabric — is designed to go from the gym to the office. It offers five separate compartments, including a padded laptop pocket, a zippered space on the bottom to store your sneakers, an internal holder for water bottles and several internal mesh pouches.

Reviewers love the thick straps that make carrying around heavy items less of a pain in the neck (literally). Plus it's chic enough to carry to work or bring to post-gym drinks without having to hide it under the table.

352,How to get out of debt and build a 'wealth snowball',"For many people, getting out of debt may seem impossible. But if you focus on paying more than what’s owed on your minimum monthly balance, it might be easier than you realize, according to Get Rich Slowly founder J.D. Roth.

“The whole idea is you’re just trying to throw as much money as possible at these debts so you get them paid off quickly,” Roth tells NBC News BETTER.

Roth calls this the “debt snowball,” a method made popular by businessman and author Dave Ramsey.

First, build a “debt snowball”

Let’s say you have five debts that total $1,000 a month. Eventually, you pay off one of those debts, and bring down your monthly payment to $800. Instead of paying the minimum, you continue paying $1,000 until your debts are all fully paid.

That includes using any raises, bonuses or windfalls to pay off those debts, Roth says.

“You just continue to throw that money at your debt repayment and by doing so — as you’re making more than minimum payments — the debt gets repaid much more quickly,” Roth says.

The blogger said he used the method to get out of $35,000 of consumer debt when he was in his mid-30s.

“It took 39 months [just over 3 years] to pay off the $35,000 once I started focusing on it,” Roth says.

Once you’re out of debt, build a “wealth snowball”

For many people who manage to pay off their debts, staying out of debt becomes the new struggle, according to Roth.

“I know a lot of people who have gotten out of debt, and once they do they’re kind of lost,” he says. “They don’t know what to do with their money next. So they go out and they start spending again, and it’s kind of like losing weight … they get into the same problems they used to have where they’re spending too much.”

You can avoid this problem by building a “wealth snowball,” he says. Instead of spending the $1,000 you were putting toward your debts, he explains, “Use that $1,000 a month to save for the future.”

You can put the money towards a retirement account, savings for a house or for your children’s college education, he says. It all depends on your personal needs.

“Start building a wealth snowball where you’re socking the money away every month in a retirement account, preferably, because they carry tax advantages. But if not retirement accounts, then in investment accounts where you’re getting returns on your investments, and these returns can compound over time, creating this wealth snowball that’s similar to a debt snowball.”

Cut back on unnecessary expenses

There are ways you can probably contribute to a wealth snowball that you don’t realize, according to Roth.

One of the biggest expenses most people can cut back on, he says, are subscriptions and recurring monthly expenses.

“Nowadays, it’s a big thing to try to get consumers to sign up for subscription services,” Roth says. “Everything from Netflix to even Microsoft Office is subscription based.”

Individually, these subscriptions may seem small, but can add up. And getting rid of at least one can give you extra money to contribute to your wealth snowball.

“What I encourage people to do is to keep a close eye on the recurring monthly expenses because they act as an anchor dragging you down so that you’re not able to increase that gap between your earnings and your spending,” Roth says.

You don’t need to be rich

How much you can contribute to your wealth snowball depends on how much you can afford. If you don’t make a lot, Roth says, it doesn’t mean you can’t save.

“If you’re struggling to get by because your income is low, then it’s going to be tough for you to save say $100 or $250 or $500 a month,” says Roth. “If that’s the case, just make it a target to save $10 or $25 or $50 a month. Every little bit helps.”

And if you can afford to, says Roth, you should contribute as much as you can to a retirement account. For some people, that means contributing 5 percent of their income to a retirement account. For others, it means contributing as much as 50 percent.

“The more aggressive you get,” he says, “the sooner you can retire.”

The most important thing, according to Roth, is that you make an effort to save.

“Whatever you want to accomplish is going to come from that gap between your earning and your spending,” Roth says.

How to build a “wealth snowball”

Step 1: Let’s say you just paid off a credit car bill, bringing your total minimum balances on all your debt from $1,000 to $800. Instead of paying the minimum, continue paying $1,000 until your debts are all fully paid. That includes using any raises, bonuses or windfalls to pay off those debts.

Step 2: Once you’re out of debt, build a “wealth snowball”: Now that your debt is repaid, begin contributing the same $1,000 a month to an investment account where it will build interest over time. The more you contribute, the bigger your wealth snowball will grow.

Step 3: To contribute as much as you can to your wealth snowball, cut back on as many unnecessary recurring expenses as possible.

Remember: You don’t need to be rich: Contribute as much money as you afford, whether it’s $200 or $10 a month. Every bit will help.

353,I gave up my credit card for a month — and learned a lot about my spending habits,"The way some people can’t resist trying the latest workout craze, trendy fashions or exotic superfoods, I can’t find enough ways to challenge myself to be better at budgeting and trying new methods to save more money for the future.

I tried a spending ban last fall, and, like any crash dieter, quickly fell back into my old spending habits. When I came into 2018 with a fresh outlook on my finances and a credit card bill that put me in denial, it was time to take another, hopefully more permanent, stab at overhauling my spending. I tried to change things directly at the source of the problem and took up a “cash diet” — meaning no credit cards, electronic payments, Uber, Venmo, Starbucks apps, you name it — for a month.

Sounded easy enough at first, right? Just stop using my credit cards? After a conversation with NBC News financial editor Jean Chatzky, I wasn’t so sure.

“You get the psychology behind credit cards, and the reason they’re so easy [...] the money goes so fast because it seems less real,” Chatzky says of electronic payments.

“The reason this is such a good exercise is because you have no idea how the money is flowing,” Chatzky says, after prompting several spending categories I hadn’t thought of on my own (including iTunes storage, recurring Amazon purchases, and movie ticketing apps, to name a few). I had no real idea of how pervasive electronic payment was in my financial life, and how little I knew about my own spending, despite monitoring it regularly.

Chatzky recommended going cold turkey, sticking fast to the no credit card rule, and staying on task for an entire month to get in a full billing cycle. I was allowed to keep using my credit cards for recurring bill payments, and I could write checks, but any daily expenses had to be made in cash.

My personal goals were to see if I could actually stay within my budget, and really learn where my money was going. If there’s anything I learned from talking with Jean, it’s that I think I know a lot more than I actually do.

Armed with these parameters and a visit to the ATM, I was as ready as I’d ever been to go credit card-free.

WEEK ONE: GOODBYE, SWEET STARBUCKS APP; HELLO, REALITY

The night before my “diet”, I wrote out my budget for the week, breaking down my spending into the categories I’d really be using (more or less: groceries and everything else), and planning out my spending based on my social calendar and everyday needs. Since I wouldn’t be using leftover gift cards through coffee apps, I’d have to budget for coffee as a semi-new expense and build in a little cushion, just to play it safe. To help keep things organized, I implemented a very high-tech system — using envelopes to keep cash in different budgets.

I also knew my roommates and I would be heading to Costco later in the month — I plucked $20 straight from my “everything else” envelope and into a “Costco” labeled one to try and build myself a buffer — it’s never an inexpensive trip for me.

My first week without plastic was not without road bumps. I was in for a rude awakening at the grocery store. I usually consider myself pretty on top of my grocery spending — but only because I stay under my “budget” at three different stores, and regrettably, that math doesn’t always add up. I walked into Trader Joe’s, cash in hand, and I could feel my anxiety kick in. Could I upgrade to Cara Cara instead of navel oranges? Was it a better deal to buy a bar of chocolate or a bag of peanut butter cups? Was that kombucha really going to enrich my life experience, or should I spend the $3.50 elsewhere?

Between the two grocery stores where I usually shop, the greenmarket stand on the corner, and a midweek banana restock, I came 54 cents in under budget on groceries, but that was a little too close for comfort. I added “staying comfortably within my grocery budget” to my list of goals.

Additionally, I’d just started drinking after a month-long hiatus, and an unexpected social event on a weeknight had me caving in to a drink — inadvertently, at a spot that didn’t take cash. The waitress (bless her) fronted the money on her own credit card, I gave her the cash, and had my first unplanned deficit in the “other” budget.

I quickly realized the challenge of not being able to use money I don’t already have, and how that can impact my social life. I have a habit of thinking of my social spending and my essential-but-not-planned-for spending as different parts of my budget, but they definitely are not. If my weekly budget is $100 one week, it seems like I can definitely get a new bottle of nail polish, order an extra drink at happy hour and take a cab home, right? Except that I also have two doctors appointments that will have $10 copays, and need more toothpaste, and completely forgot my grandma’s birthday and I have to get her a card, and some more stamps, and since I’m in the drugstore anyway I’m also out of ibuprofen... That one budget can shrink a lot, regardless of how it works in my brain. I wanted to challenge myself to overcome this mental separation without making myself crazy or feel like I was missing out on a lot of fun. I’d be choosing “stuff” and activities more wisely, not neglecting experiences I really wanted.

WEEK TWO: COSTCO COUNTS AS AN EMERGENCY...RIGHT?

Socially, I was faced with a couple of challenges in week two. I knew I was already over budget because of the Costco run. I had a night in with the girls on the books (Seamless was a given for us), lunch with a friend from out of town, and drinks with my sketch comedy teammates after our latest show, in addition to all of the things I’d need to get through a normal week.

During week two, I had to grin and bear the great financial temptation of heading to Costco, and I was ready to fight it as much as possible. I walked in armed with a carefully planned list of things my roommates and I would share, as well as essentials I wanted to stock up on. I came with a list, I stuck to the list, and I still spent a lot of money (about two weeks’ worth of grocery money, to be exact). As I had a minor meltdown next to the shampoo, my roommate pointed out that these were all items I’d be using more or less every day — even if the sticker shock was high, it would be a worthwhile investment in the long run.

Costco’s credit card rules ended up hurting me — although my roommate had planned to use her card given my diet, I had to use mine since the membership is in my name. Putting over $300 worth of bulk items on a (debit) card seemed emergency enough to me.

My plan to pay off my Costco “debt” ASAP was to come in under budget on groceries for the remainder of the month ... and I didn’t quite succeed. I was quickly learning that timing is everything when budgeting. I needed to stock up on some everyday staples (for me, vinegar, tea, almonds and some frozen veggies), and that emptied out my “groceries” envelope sooner than I had planned.

My second credit card snafu came when I sat down to file my taxes — no way to pay that e-filing fee in cash. I took note in my spending spreadsheet and planned to pay myself back from my refund.

A few unexpected expenses popped up, too — in a moment of weakness, I grabbed a quick bite from my neighborhood deli, I needed to buy a sympathy card, and dole out the cash for a prescription that I thought would be covered by my insurance. And I was in desperate need of dry cleaning — but that would have to wait until the budget balanced out.

WEEK THREE: BALANCING ACT

My social calendar this week, fortunately, revolved around beer — a cheap way to have a good time. I was able to keep a Friday night out and celebratory drinks with my comedy teammates to under $30 (thank goodness for happy hour). But, this week, I needed to actually buy things that weren’t groceries, and I was anxious about making it all work.

I was already a little tight on cash (I picked up some OTC medication, which was not as cheap as I would have liked, on my first day), and knew I’d need to start stocking up on other things that I’d been putting off replacing. I wasn’t entirely sure I could have a social life and go shopping the same week.

Although I’m not a big online clothing shopper, I do use Amazon quite frequently for pantry items and beauty products and was starting to feel the burn of not having that easy access to so many items (or that sweet, sweet Prime shipping). I’d been wistfully adding replacement tubes of lip balm, peanut butter and books to my cart, biding my time for a new month to start. Not the best practice during my month off from cards, I know, but not being able to buy things instantly forced me to reconsider those purchases and decide what was really important.",0
354,How the 50-20-30 rule can help you get out of debt and save money,"If you are struggling to save money and pay off debt, the 50-20-30 rule can help you budget in accordance with your financial goals, according to Rob Berger, founder of The Dough Roller. He says the simple rule provides flexibility, whether you want to pay off debt, save, invest or all three.

The rule splits your after-tax, take-home pay into three buckets.

“Fifty percent is for needs, thirty percent is for wants, twenty percent is for savings,” Berger tells NBC News BETTER.

Here’s the breakdown.

50 percent: Includes rent/mortgage, food, bills, minimum debt payments and other essentials

20 percent: Includes financial goals such as savings, investment, etc

30 percent: Dining, entertainment, etc

Figure out how much you can realistically save

Before you begin, you’ll need to determine out how much you can realistically save, says Berger.

For example, someone with high expenses and high debt may need to adjust the rule to 80-10-10 until they have reduced their debt and grown their savings.

But before you assume you can’t afford to save 20 percent, Berger advises, take the time to examine your spending habits.

“Rather than immediately say, ‘Oh, this won’t work, I can’t save 20 percent — which I understand, I’ve been there, most people have been there — spend some time thinking ‘Well, wait a minute, if I had to make this work, what choices could I make to make it work?’ Think through all the things you absolutely must have,” advises Berger.

“You got to focus on what you absolutely have to have, and that means really shrinking that 30 percent bucket — getting rid of everything you don’t have to have,” says Berger. “Which is not always easy and not always fun, but if you find yourself in a difficult financial situation, you’ve got to make those tough decisions.”

What can you cut out?

You might be overspending money in ways you don’t realize, says Berger. First, look at your major expenses — rent, mortgage, car payments, etc. — and ask yourself if there are ways to reduce them, he says. You might be able to save by moving to a cheaper city, for instance, or by purchasing a used car instead of a new one, he says.

If it’s not possible to cut back on major expenses, then you need to take a look at your smaller expenses, says Berger.

Go through the list of expenses in your 50 percent bucket and ask yourself: “Do I need this? Can I get rid of it, or can I somehow lower it?”

“If you haven’t checked car insurance rates in three years [for example] maybe you should shop around for better car insurance,” says Berger.

You’ll also need to examine the expenses in your 30 percent bucket to see what you tend to waste money on the most, he says. For some people, that may be clothes, for others, electronics or eating out. Berger suggest creating a mini-budget that will prevent you from overspending on your lifestyle habits. For instance, if you tend to splurge on dining out, create a dining budget that aligns with your savings goals.

“So you don’t have to track every dime if you don’t want to, just pick those one or two or three categories that cause you the most problems and set a budget that you don’t surpass for those categories,” says Berger.

He says there are plenty of online tools like YNAB that can help you manage your spending.

Figure out your savings goals

How you manage your 20 percent savings bucket will depend on your personal goals, says Berger.

If you don’t already have much saved, he suggests using it to build an emergency savings fund. Once you’ve got an amount you feel comfortable with, he says, you can start contributing part of your savings to an investment like an IRA or a mutual fund.

If your goal is to pay off debt, he says, you can start designating a percentage of your 20 percent bucket to pay above the minimum on your loans until they are paid off.

If debt isn’t an issue for you, he says, you can contribute part or all of the 20 percent to a retirement fund. But in most cases, Berger warns, investing 20 percent won’t be enough if you want to retire early.

“I would say you’re probably looking at at least 30 percent or higher and, again, it depends on how quickly you want to retire,” he says.

This financial calculator can help you figure out how much you’ll need to invest to retire early.

Control your wants and live beneath your means

Berger says the biggest challenge for most people using the 50-30-20 rule is controlling their wants and living beneath their means. He says this may especially be a struggle for young professionals getting a job for the first time.

“You’re getting the job with a little bit of money and you want as nice a car as you can afford, and you want as nice an apartment as you can afford, and then you sit back and you say ‘Oh, I can’t save 20 percent, that’s impossible.’ And it’s not impossible, it’s just that choices have been made that put you in a box that makes it really difficult,” he says.

Berger knows from experience. After graduating from law school in the 1990s, Berger was tens of thousands of dollars in debt. On top of that, he struggled with mortgage, car payments and other monthly expenses that piled up.

Through careful budgeting, he says his debts were paid off by 2016. He says the main reason he and his wife are now debt-free is because they continued to live beneath their means even as they paid off their loans.

“We live in the same house that we lived in — we bought it 14 years ago, it’s the same house we lived in when we made a lot less money,” he says.

Berger says they also contributed their savings to an investment account as they paid off their debt, which grew their nest egg.

“So we kept our lifestyle the same even while our income went up and we put all of that to pay down that debt… in saving and investing,” he says.

Berger’s advice to those who want to be debt free is simple: make a promise to yourself to not get into more debt.

“And to me the biggest struggle is just making that decision not to get into any more debt for any reason and sticking to it,” Berger says.

355,How the '50/50 path' helped one couple pay off their mortgage in four years,"Michigan couple Andy and Nicole Hill, 36, paid off their mortgage in four years by living on just half their monthly income.

When they got married in 2011, the Hills vowed to achieve their goal off paying off their $50,000 in consumer debt before purchasing a home.

That’s when they decided to take the “50/50 path” — living on just half their monthly income, says Andy Hill, founder of Marriage, Kids and Money.

“We decided if we’re going to have a great life together and show our kids how to be financially responsible before they come into the world, why don’t we try to clobber this debt as soon as possible?” says Hill.

Staying on the 50/50 path allowed the couple to pay off their debt in about a year, says Hill.

By the time they were ready to buy their four-bedroom home in Bloomfield, Michigan in 2012, they had saved enough money for a 40 percent down payment.

“That got us to that $195,000 mortgage mark,” recalls Hill.

Shortly after, Nicole quit her job to stay home with their two children, Hill says. But he says they’ve continued to live on 50 percent of their income.

“It’s made a lot of difference in our family’s ability to build wealth and to just protect our family,” he says.

Adopt the zero-based budget

The 50/50 path requires you to become conscious about how you spend, Hill says.

The Hills embraced the “zero-based budget,” a simple budget where you allocate every dollar to a specific task.

For example, if you are making $5,000 a month, you would allocate each dollar to your expenses, your savings, your debt, and any other obligations, so that your bottom line comes to zero, explains Hill.

“That way you are allocating all of your dollars to a specific function as opposed to them fluttering away and not being assigned to anything,” he explains.

To reduce spending, the couple cut their grocery purchases by a third, switched from cable to antenna, and negotiated their cell phone bills.

Figure out a timeline that works for you

Look at your income and your expenses. Figure out a realistic time frame for when you plan to have your mortgage paid, and commit to it, Hill says.

If you don’t make a big salary, Hill says, it’s still possible to pay off your mortgage quickly — it will just take a bit more time.

“Maybe it’s 10 years — that’s still incredible,” he says. “Maybe it’s 15 years,” he adds, “that’s a lot quicker than the majority of America right now.”

Get a mortgage that is no more than 25 percent of your take home pay

A big reason the Hills were able to pay off their mortgage quickly is because they purchased their $350,000 home at a price well under what they could afford.

Hill, a salesman for an event marketing company, says he and his wife didn’t want to spend more than 25 percent of their take-home pay on monthly mortgage payments.

“That allowed us to have some fun and pay for our transportation, and going out and having family fun, and going on vacation without feeling like the mortgage is taking over our lives,” says Hill.

If possible, get a 15-year mortgage

The Hills chose a 15-year mortgage over the traditional 30-year. While the monthly payments were higher, they paid more towards the principal and less in interest, Hill says, which he estimates saved them around $100,000 in the long term. What’s more, the larger payments motivated them to pay off the mortgage as quickly as possible, he adds.

“I kind of wanted to add that added pressure to allow us to pay back the mortgage faster,” says Hill.

The mortgage is paid, now what?

Now that the Hills have paid off their mortgage, they can focus on their next goal: saving up for their first rental property.

“We want to buy a rental property, rent it out in metro Detroit, and have some monthly recurring passive income that we can use to cover our daily expenses,” says Hill.

Hill says paying off his mortgage in four years took many sacrifices, but was worth it in the long run.

“It’s for a season, a period of time, maybe tightening things up a little bit, figuring out a way to increase the income, but once you reach that mark, you have the ability to make some choices that really can impact your life,” Hill says.

How to pay off your mortgage quickly

Take the “50/50 path”: Live off half your monthly take-home pay, and save the rest.

Live off half your monthly take-home pay, and save the rest. Adopt the “zero-based budget”: Make sure every dollar you make is allocated to either debt payment, savings, expenses, etc. This will force you to become more conscious of how you spend.

356,"How this couple paid off $65,000 in credit card debt and student loans in five years","Five years ago, Tammy, 52, and Dennis Gray, 54, owed $65,000 in credit card debt and student loans. After their son and daughter went off to college, the empty nesters realized they wanted more from life than being in debt.

“We knew we needed to do something because it wasn’t going to get better,” Tammy tells NBC News BETTER.

The Pennsylvania couple say they tried different techniques, but nothing worked. “We could never stay disciplined,” says Dennis, a pastor at a church in Kingston, PA.

The couple eliminated their debt through what they call “visualization.”

They combined the envelope system, a method of using visualization to stow away extra cash, with the debt snowball method, where you pay more than your minimum payment on your credit cards.

The couple also made moves to reduce their spending. They began eating less expensive meals, and cut back on things they didn’t need, like cable. They say switching to an antenna, which provided 20 channels for free, saved them a big chunk of cash each month.

How the envelope system works

Figure out the categories where you tend to spend the most. For example: Mortgage, savings, car payment, bills, credit cards. Designate an envelope for each category.

Every time you have extra cash, you’ll put a percentage in each envelope. How much will depend on your unique needs.

For example,

Mortgage: 50 percent

Savings: 10 percent

Car payment: 10 percent

Bills: 10 percent;

Credit cards: 20 percent

Tammy, a missionary, says the envelope system allowed them to see what steps they needed to take to get out of debt.

“It just became very clear how to make the money work,” she says.

Tammy says using an electronic version of the system allowed her to automate money from her paychecks directly into each category.

“You don’t have to think about it, once you designate that’s how you want to break it down,” she says.

Combining the snowball method

After sitting down with a financial coach, the Grays say they were shocked to see how much money they were paying in interest on credit card debt.

“I remember crying,” says Tammy.

“What opened up our eyes was how much interest we paid on the credit card alone, not counting the principal,” adds Dennis. “That really motivated us to pay it off quickly.”

The Grays began to apply the “snowball method” to paying down their massive credit card debt.

The method requires you to pay more than what you owe on your minimum monthly credit card payments. How much you contribute will depend on your unique needs and circumstances. The key is to continue paying it off at the same amount or more, even as the amount you owe decreases.

Over time, the Grays’ credit card debt began to go down, which means they could increase the amount they contributed to paying off their debt.

After five years, they made their last credit card payment in September.

“That’s an amazing feeling,” says Tammy.

Now that their credit card debt is eliminated, the couple is focused on paying off their home loan. Since they no longer have to pay off credit cards, they can afford to double the monthly payments to their their mortgage.

The couple say their son and his wife, recently married, plan to use the same system to manage their own money.

“My heart is very emotional that they won’t go through what we did,” Tammy says.

357,The best resistance bands of 2021 — and a 30-day workout plan to put them to work,"EXERCISE BANK

Now, let’s take a look at the exercise bank we have for each category. For each workout, you’ll pick any three exercises from each bank. Complete three sets (12-15 reps) of each exercise you choose. Mix it up each time and give different exercises a try.

LOWER BODY EXERCISE BANK

Band Positioning: Around the ankles

How to put the band on: Step your feet into the center of the band, and use your hands to roll the band up over the ankles. Make sure it’s open as thick as possible without any curling so that it doesn’t feel uncomfortable on your skin if you’re wearing capris or shorts.

Standing Side Taps

With the band around your ankles, pull your navel in toward your spine and bend your knees so that your booty is reaching back. Place your feet open just as wide as your shoulders. This is a modified squat position and you’ll stay here for the exercise. Tap your right foot out to the right, feeling the tension on the band and then bring it back to center so that the feet are just as wide as the shoulders. Then tap the left foot to the left and feel the tension on the band, and then bring it back to center. Repeat this for 10 taps to each side. This works the gluteus medius (the muscle on the outside of the hip) and the thighs. It’s also a bit of a cardio move since you’re tapping from one side to the other without a break.

Standing Reverse Taps

From the same position as the standing side steps, this time instead of stepping to the side, you’ll step back with each foot and tap. You’ll feel the tension on the stationary leg as well, making this a total leg and glute workout move.

Standing Adductor Lift

Standing straight up with your abs drawn in, lift the right leg out to the side, and then bring it back in. The tension that the band adds can be felt on the eccentric and concentric movement — as you push the leg out and as you pull the leg back to center. This is primarily working the gluteus medius, and also the stabilizing muscles of the legs and the standing leg that’s balancing you. Repeat this 10 times and then switch to the left side.

Band Positioning: Around lower knee

How to: Step inside the band with both feet, and wiggle the band with your fingers up around your shin bones directly underneath your knee. You can leave about 2-3 fingers’ width space from your knee down to the top of the band for reference.

Standing Banded Squat

Step the feet out as wide as the hips, pull the navel in, and bend at the knees to sit back with your glutes. Act like you’re sitting back into a chair, and then drill down through the heels to stand back up. The band helps activate the glutes with the tension around the legs, and also helps stabilize your body for a more properly formed squat. Repeat this 10 times.

Standing Lateral Band Walk

Step into the band with both feet, and pull the feet as wide as the hips to create tension on the band. Lower down into a half squat position while pulling your navel in toward your spine, and pressing down through the heels of your feet. Then shift your weight over to your left side, and step sideways to the right. Bring your left foot slightly in, keeping tension on the band, and continuing to side step to the right like this for 10 steps. Then repeat to the left.

The next two lower body exercises are performed on your hands and knees.

Band Positioning: Around stationary foot, and on top of moving leg

How to: This is tricky, so if you find it challenging to get the band on properly (let alone do the exercise) you’re not alone. The best way to do this is to squat down and step your right foot a little more forward than your left. Wrap the band around the front of your right shoe, and then while holding the band, lower onto your right knee and wrap the band around the left shoe as well.

Donkey Kicks

From your hands and knees, pull your navel in toward your spine. Make sure your hands are underneath your shoulders with your fingers spread wide and pressing down through your fingers and your hands. Open your knees just as wide as the hips, and make sure the knees are under the hips. Then, press the right leg up so that it’s at a 90 degree angle, and then press up through the foot to work the glute and hamstring of the right leg. You’ll also be stabilizing with the left leg and working the left glute.

Band Positioning: above knees

Fire Hydrant

From your hands and knees, pull your navel in toward your spine. Get into the same positioning as above, and instead of reaching your leg back behind you, reach the right leg out to the side. This is a motion similar to a dog peeing on a fire hydrant. Open the right leg out to the right side, and then bring it back toward center. Repeat this 10 times, and then switch to the left leg.

The next exercises are performed lying down on your side.

Band Positioning: Around upper thighs

Banded Clam Shell

Lying down on your right side, prop yourself up with your right forearm on the ground on a 90 degree angle. Bring the legs slightly forward of your hips, and pull your navel in toward your spine. Then, bend the knees so that your legs are at a 90 degree angle. Keep your feet pressing together as you open your top knee up away from your bottom knee as if you’re opening up a clam shell. Repeat this 10 times, and then switch sides or move onto the next exercise.

Band Positioning: Around your ankles

Side Lying Banded Leg Lifts

Lying down on your right side with the band around your ankles, press your right forearm into the ground at a 90 degree angle. Bring the legs slightly forward of your hips and pull your navel in toward your spine. Then pull the left leg straight up away from the right leg, and lower it back down. Maintain tension on the band throughout the whole exercise. Repeat for 10 repetitions and then switch sides or continue on to the next exercise.

Band Positioning: Lying on your right side, step onto the band with your left foot and wrap the band around the right shoe.

Side Lying Inner Thigh Banded Leg Lifts

Lying down on your right side with your left leg behind you and your feet in the strap, pulse the right leg up 10 times. This is working the inner thigh.

UPPER BODY EXERCISE BANK

Band Positioning: Around the forearms

Rear Delt Pull

Bend the elbows at a 90 degree angle so that your arms are parallel to the ground. Reach the arms forward and then bend the elbows and bring the arms toward your chest as you squeeze your upper back. This works the medial deltoid, rear deltoid, scapula, and biceps. Repeat 10 times.

Banded Open & Close

Bend at the elbows and bring your arms up into a goal post position at chest level. Open and close the arms (reference photo) to work the upper arms and upper back. Repeat 10 times.

Band Positioning: Hold the band with your left hand on your chest, and your right hand holding onto the band below.

Tricep Extension with Band

Using your left hand, press the band to your chest. Use the right hand to press down against the band into a tricep extension, and then come back to the starting position. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides.

Band Positioning: Standing on your knees, step the right foot forward into a modified lunge position, and then wrap the band underneath the right knee.

Bicep Curl 1 with Band

Put the right hand through the band in an open-face position to start. Then, pull the right hand with the band up toward the shoulder into a bicep curl, and release down. Repeat 10 times and then switch sides.

Band Positioning: Around forearms

Bicep Curl 2 with Band

Hold the bands on outside of your forearms with the palms face up and your elbows hugging in towards your side body. Then, curl the hands up toward your shoulders into a bicep curl, and lower back down. Repeat 10 times.

Shoulder Press with Band

From the same positioning as above, curl the arms up into a bicep curl and use this as your starting position. Then press arms up over head with abduction against the bands, and then lower down to the start position. Repeat 10 times.

Shoulder Side Raise with Band

Band Positioning:Around forearms

Start with your arms parallel to your body, elbows bent at a 90-degree angle (to create two goal posts in front of your abdomen) with palms facing each other. This is your starting position. Then pull the arms out to the side and up like wings as high as your shoulders with elbows still bent (you should have created a straight line from your shoulder to your elbow). Lower back down.

Bentover Row with Band

Band Positioning: Step on the band with the right foot and lower down onto your left knee. Then, lean forward, hold onto band with the right hand.

For this exercise, pull the band up by hugging your elbow into your side and squeezing the right shoulder blade in toward the center of your spine, and then release the arm down. Continue pulling up and then releasing down for 10 repetitions, and then switch sides.

ABDOMINALS EXERCISE BANK

Band Positioning: Placing the band below the knees is easier, and placing the band above the knees outside of the thighs is more challenging.

Banded Bridge

Lying down on your back, bend your knees with your feet on the ground as wide as your hips. Bring the band around your upper thighs. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale as you pull your navel in toward your spine, and tilt your pelvis so that your hips are coming close to your ribs. Slowly roll up into a bridge position, pressing against the band and opening the legs wide. As you come up into the bridge position with your back off of the ground, hold it at the top. Then, pulse the legs and the band out to the sides for 10 counts. Slowly lower the back down onto the ground vertebrae by vertebrae and then repeat for 10 times.

Banded Lower & Lift

Lying down on your back, wrap the band around your upper thighs. Pull your navel in toward your spine and reach the legs straight up toward the ceiling. Open the feet wide enough to put tension on the band, and then lower the legs down as far as you can without lifting your back off the ground. Then bring the legs back up to center. Repeat for 10 repetitions.

Banded Toe Taps

Lying down on your back, bend your knees with your feet on the ground as wide as your hips. Bring the band around your upper thighs. Take a deep breath in, and then exhale as you pull your navel in toward your spine, and tilt your pelvis so that your hips are coming close to your ribs. Bring the knees up into a tabletop position at a 90 degree angle. Open the legs to put tension on the band, and lower the feet toward the ground. Keep the knees bent. Then bring the knees back up to the starting position, and repeat for 10 times.

Band Positioning: On top of the left shoe and on the bottom of the right shoe

Banded Criss-Cross with band around top of shoes

With the band wrapped around your shoes, lie down on your back and bend the knees up into a tabletop position. Place your hands behind your head. Exhale and curl up into a crunch position. Extend the left leg and curl up toward the right knee, and then switch. Bicycle the legs and criss cross your chest to work the internal and external obliques. Repeat 10 times to each side.

ADVANCED PLANK SEQUENCE

Pick one of these at a time to try, or do them all at once when you feel physically ready. These are pretty challenging moves.

Band Positioning: Around the outer wrists

How to: On your hands and knees, put your hands through the band and place it on the outsides of your wrists.

Plank Push-Ups with Banded Arms

Come up onto your toes into a plank position. Press down firmly with your hands and make sure your shoulders are over your wrists. Pull your navel in toward your spine, and keep your back flat. From here, step your right hand out to the right, pulling on the band, then lower down into a push-up. For a modification, this can be done on your knees. Then, walk the hand back to center, and walk the left hand out to the left, lower down into a push up, and come back to center. Repeat this for 5 push-ups on each side. This works your core, chest, back, and upper arms.

Band Positioning: Around the ankles

How to: Sitting down on the floor, wrap the band around your ankles and then press back onto your hands and knees.

Plank Jumps with Banded Ankles

Press up into a plank position from your hands and knees. Pull your abs in tight, and then jump both of your feet out and then back in to center. Keep tension on the band even as you come back into the center so that the band stays taught around your ankles. This works your core, shoulders, arms, gluteus medius, thighs and hamstrings.

Modification: Plank Modified Jumps with Banded Ankles

Instead of jumping the feet away from each other and then back in, simply tap with right foot out to the right and back to center, and then tap with the left foot out to the left and back to center.

Plank Banded Booty Lifts

Come into plank position with your shoulders over your wrists and your feet as wide as your hips. Keep your right leg straight as you lift it up a few inches off the ground, and then place it back down. Repeat on the left side. This will really burn the hamstrings and the glutes. Repeat each side 10 times.

This week is the National Sleep Foundation’s Sleep Awareness Week, a means to promote and educate people on sleep health. The awareness week is marked by the beginning of Daylight Savings Time, when we all lose an hour of sleep.

A good night’s sleep is important to both our physical and mental health. According to to the Sleep Foundation, adults between the ages of 18 and 64 need an average of seven to nine hours of sleep at night, but over 35 percent of all adults in the U.S. report sleeping less than seven hours. And Americans are looking for ways to help themselves get more of those precious hours of shuteye. According to P&S Intelligence, a market research company, sleep aids were a $78 billion industry in 2019 and that number is expected to grow to $163 billion by 2030. If you’re looking to improve nightly rest without resorting to medication, there are plenty of products available that can help. Here are some of our top picks.

Best Sleep Aids of 2021

""In order to create a conducive sleep environment we want it as dark as possible and the blackout curtains will block out warming light for people who are sleeping when the sun is shining, or in the summer when it starts to get light earlier. Street lights and city lights can also interfere with sleep,"" said Dianne Augelli, MD, a sleep physician at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. These blackout curtains from Amazon are 100-percent polyester and made with a triple-weave fabric, meant to block out light and diminish any intrusive noise from the outside. They include two panels with velcro ties so you can pull them back when you are not sleeping. These blackout curtains are also machine-washable for easy cleaning.

It’s not just the light coming from our devices, but other lights in the room, that can keep you awake.

“I advise turning down the lights in your home towards the end of the day,"" said Dr. Apostolos Lekkos, founder of Bios Functional Medicine. ""Lower light levels can help promote your natural melatonin production — your sleep hormone.”

Philips smart bulbs make it easier to do this. You can pair the light bulbs with your mobile device, Amazon or Google assistant to control up to 10 lights in a room. If you’re looking to integrate more than 10 Philips Hue smart bulbs, the Hue Hub controls up to 50 lights. Use your voice assistant or mobile device to turn lights on and off, or change intensity from bright or dimmed to nightlight before getting ready for bed.

If you tend to run hot at night, you might want to consider investing in cooling bedding. ""We definitely want you to be cool when you're sleeping. If you're too hot and you feel that the particular sheets that you have are making you too hot, then you can consider a different type of sheet,"" said Dr. Augelli. PeachSkinSheets are designed for warm sleepers and best known for their temperature control abilities. Lindsay France, a stylist and former Textile Technologist for Ralph Lauren and Victoria’s Secret, previously told us that these are “hands down the best all-around sheets for hot sleepers.” These sheets have a 1500-thread count and are moisture-wicking.

Philips SmartSleep, which connects to your home Wi-Fi, helps improve your sleep quality by helping you learn about how the environment in your bedroom affects your rest. You'll be interacting with its proprietary app SleepMapper to document and receive feedback on some of your behaviors.

“The best cure for being unable to fall asleep is utilizing a sleep tracker which is available through many apps,"" said Lindsey Huttner, LCSW, psychotherapist, located in Queens, NY. ""In the app you will document when you get into bed, approximate time you fall asleep, how long you sleep, and how many times you woke and for how long. The app will then 'prescribe' how much sleep you should aim to get.""

In addition to tracking your sleep patterns, SmartSleep works with its companion app to track and monitor your bedroom's temperature, noise, light and humidity levels. The light it emits is designed to ease you out of sleep.

Although Fitbit is best known for its exercise tracking abilities, it is also a good device for monitoring sleep. Fitbit’s latest smartwatch can help you track and better understand your sleep patterns. It shows you not only how long you were asleep but how much time throughout the night you spent in light, deep and REM sleep. It then takes this information and assigns you a Sleep Score that indicates how good or bad your rest was. Augelli said devices like this can be helpful ""if you’re tracking your number of hours of sleep and making sure you get adequate sleep and that you’re going to sleep around the same time."" The Fitbit Sense also features a Smart Wake Alarm that is meant to wake you up at the “optimal stage of sleep” to give you a better start to the day, according to the brand.

If you just can't seem to part with your nightly Netflix ritual, “you should wear blue light blocking sunglasses while watching television,” advised Dr. Lekkos.

""Blue light suppresses melatonin, which is our natural hormone that helps with sleep; the decrease in melatonin can prevent you from falling asleep,"" added Augelli. ""What you want to do ideally, is put away all your work and phone an hour before bed, in the process of your wind down routine. But if you have to work, you want to employ whatever you can to reduce the amount of impact it will have. There are some small studies that show that the time it takes to fall asleep has been reduced for people who wore the light blocking glasses for several hours before bedtime.""

With the ongoing pandemic, it may feel as though you are spending more time in front of a screen than ever before. Izipizi’s glasses filter 40 percent of the blue light emitted from your screen, which is meant to help reduce the strain on your eyes. The arms of the glasses are designed with flex spring hinges that adapt to all face shapes and sizes, according to the brand. They offer multiple frame and color options so you can pick a style that best suits you.

""For some people sound is soothing and relaxing and helps deactivate them for sleep,"" said Augelli. ""Some of them will act to cover up other environmental noise, so in those cases it can be helpful; you just want to make sure there is no big change in frequency of that sound. For example, on the TV when there’s a commercial that’s much louder,” she added.

The LectroFran Evo offers ten fan sounds with white, pink and brown noise variations as well as two ocean sounds. It is designed to create unique and non-repeating sounds, according to the brand. You can set a timer on the device and even connect it to your headphones or speakers to suit your preference of sound. It boasts a 4.7-star average from over 9,000 Amazon reviewers.

According to Michael Gelb, DDS, MS, co-author of the book ""GASP!: Airway Health - The Hidden Path to Wellness,"" more than half of us struggle with breathing through our noses. This struggle often results in snoring. And even if you're part of the half who has no problem breathing at night, there's a good chance your partner's issues are affecting your quality of sleep. This is when a Mute Snoring device can come in handy.

By holding open the nasal airways like a stent, Mute helps noisy snorers and poor nasal breathers by increasing airflow in the nose. You can individually adjust the device for each nostril, so it's comfortable while you sleep. And user trials are promising: 75 percent of people reported less or much less snoring while using Mute.

If stress or anxiety keeps you awake at night, you may want to consider downloading the popular Calm app. Calm offers a wide selection of stories and meditations meant to help you fall asleep faster. You can fall asleep to the voices of some of your favorite celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, Mandy Moore and Harry Styles. Over one million Apple users have given the app a 4.8-star average and it is ranked the No. 3 app for Health & Fitness.

359,How to choose the best weighted blanket for you in 2021,"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices.

Thanks to high stress levels and a brain that wouldn’t shut off, I was in search of a way to get a better night’s rest. I’m a serial tosser-and-turner, and it’s often difficult for me to fall — and stay — asleep because I’m constantly thinking about what I have to tackle on my to-do list the next day. It’s a vicious cycle that leaves me feeling completely drained in the morning.

SKIP AHEAD: Other weighted blankets to consider

After weeks of seeing weighted blanket ads pop up in my social feeds, I decided to give the trend a try. Weighted blankets have seen a surge in popularity, with many proponents saying they have stress-, anxiety- and insomnia-relieving effects. The hype is palpable: Gravity Blanket racked up more than $4 million on its Kickstarter campaign in 2017, and according to Pinterest, saves for weighted blankets were up a whopping 259 percent in 2018. Over the holidays, Google released its annual gift guide featuring 100 of the most popular products worth gifting, which included weighted blankets. The search engine also noted there was a 79-percent increase in search for chunky blankets.

So with Rocabi's 15-pound weighted blanket in hand (which is the size the brand recommends for people who are between 100-150 pounds), I got into bed, hopeful but nervous. I was worried that the blanket would be restrictive and too hot (disrupting my already patchy sleep), but I was able to turn onto my side pretty easily, and it didn’t cause me to overheat. (Now, I probably won’t use a weighted blanket on 90-degree nights, but it was totally fine on a 70-degree night.)

Because I couldn’t physically move as much, I noticed that my thoughts weren’t racing as much either.

When I slipped under the blanket, I felt like I was wrapped in a cocoon, as if the blanket were hugging me. (That feeling of being hugged is what Irina Zhdanova, MD, CEO of ClockCoach, told me was likely responsible for any calming effects.) Although it was possible for me to shift onto my side, the blanket was definitely more snug than my regular comforter, and I felt like it encouraged my body to stay still. Normally, I’m pretty restless in bed, and the act of moving around makes my mind wander. But, because I couldn’t physically move as much, I noticed that my thoughts weren’t racing as much either. I was able to just focus on the present, and that made it easier to fall asleep. I didn’t wake up once in the middle of the night, which is very rare for me, and after seven hours of solid sleep I felt so refreshed that I didn’t even need to stop for my iced coffee on the way to the office.

But is there really any concrete evidence to support my seemingly better sleep experience? Or was it all in my head?

Unlike other weighted blankets that are filled with polyester batting, Rocabi’s weighted blanket uses glass beads to provide a gentle compression. It comes in various weights (10 lbs, 15 lbs, 20 lbs, 25 lbs and 30 lbs) that depend on your depending on your body weight). Other than the multiple weight options, the blanket is also available in queen and king bed sizes. An added bonus, the weighted quilt is machine washable.

How weighted blankets work: benefits and limitations

Weighted blankets are exactly what they sound like — they’re heavy blankets (typically 15 pounds or more) filled with a material such as plastic pellets. The theory is that the deep pressure you feel from being under all of that weight has a calming effect.

Heiser says the 15-pound blanket helped calm her racing thoughts and lulled her to sleep.

The deep pressure of the blanket makes you feel like you’re being hugged or swaddled, explained Zhdanova. “Being hugged is a very powerful stimulus,” she said. “When you’re hugged, you feel more secure.” Plus, weighted blankets offer mild restraint, said Zhdanova — they make it harder for you to move and thus harder for you to disturb yourself while you sleep.

For a study published in the “Journal of the Formosan Medical Association,” participants undergoing wisdom tooth removal (which the researchers identified as one of the most stressful medical procedures) wore weighted blankets during their surgeries. Under the weighted blankets, the patients showed more activity in the part of the nervous system that is in control during times of low stress.

One of the most popular uses for weighted blankets is for treating children with disorders like autism and ADHD. “It’s absolutely true that some kids benefit from compression, either from weighted blankets or stretchy Lycra sleeping bags [which also provide deep pressure],” said Lynelle Schneeberg, board-certified sleep psychologist and director of the behavioral sleep program at Connecticut Children's Medical Center. A study published in “The American Journal of Occupational Therapy” found that elementary school-aged students who wore weighted vests paid attention more and fidgeted less in class.

That being said, there are a few cons to weighted blankets, especially when it comes to having kids use them. They’re heavy, which makes them hard to travel with, they get hot, and it can prove difficult for children to use them on their own without parents there. “When parents ask me about weighted blankets, I ask if their child can put it on, arrange it and tuck themselves in,” said Schneeberg. She prefers Lycra sleeping bags for children, which are available on Etsy and Amazon, because they’re lighter, more portable and easier to use.

How to pick the best weighted blanket for you

If you are going to try a weighted a blanket, keep in mind that they can get pricey. A 20-pound Gravity Blanket, for example, costs $189. (If you’re crafty, Schneeberg said you can DIY your own version — here’s a DIY weighted blanket tutorial.)

Committed to shelling out some cash? Zhdanova recommends sticking with a weighted blanket on the lighter side. Most experts advise choosing one that’s roughly 10 percent of your body weight — so if you’re 150 pounds, you should buy a 15-pound blanket. Zhdanova notes that you shouldn’t use a weighted blanket if you snore or have sleep apnea, because anything that is placed on your chest can disrupt your breathing even further.

But if stress, a mile-long to-do list and funneling caffeine to get through the day is the battle you're fighting, a weighted blanket may just help you put those sleepless nights behind you.

Other weighted blankets to consider

As we wait for the vaccine rollout to allow us to slowly get back to some semblance of normalcy, many of us are still feeling anxious and stressed out. And with extra time at home, we may be looking for new ways to relax. With that in mind, we rounded up seven other weighted blankets worth considering in 2021.

The previously mentioned Gravity Blanket is highly-rated and available in four sizes: 15, 20, 25 and 35 pounds. According to a 2019 sleep study, 72 percent of the participants using the Gravity Blanket reported more restful sleep and 76 percent said they were able to fall asleep faster. Aside from this Grey option, the blanket also comes in navy and white.

The Casper Weighted Blanket is throw-sized, meaning you can use it in bed or take it with you to the couch. It features a polyester batting fill and inner liner, and a breathable cotton outer shell to keep you cool while you sleep. It also sports quilted channels to evenly distribute the microbead fill.

This weighted blanket from Bearaby is made from recycled marine plastic. According to Bearaby, this blanket boasts an Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certification, meaning it was independently tested and is free of harmful substances. It's available in three weights — 15 and 20 pounds — and five colors ranging from a rich, jewel-toned Midnight Blue to a more neutral Evening Rose.

If you live somewhere warm during the winter or find that you sweat easily at night, opt for a cooling model, such as this bestselling weighted blanket instead. It's available in a plethora of sizes to fit your needs, ranging from five pounds that's light enough for small children to a 30-pound blanket, which fits a king-sized bed, such as the Casper Original Foam Mattress.

Are you shopping for an eco-friendly weighted blanket? Baloo's offering is made from Oeko-TEX certified cotton and was recently named one of the best eco-friendly weighted blankets of 2020. The highly-rated quilted weighted blanket is filled with micro-sized glass beads, which helps evenly disperse the weight. It's available in four sizes: 15, 20 and 25 pounds, plus for added protection and comfort, you can order the linen duvet cover, which is also made in three sizes.

Saatva's diamond-quilted weighted blanket is made from soft, organic cotton velvet and manufactured at Fair Trade-certified factories, according to the brand. It's stuffed with glass beads, which is considered a higher-end and eco-friendly filling for weighted blankets. Choose between two size options —15 and 25 pounds — along with two colors: Graphite Vintage Velvet, a deep grey, and Taupe Vintage Velvet, a neutral khaki.

You don't have to splurge on a weighted blanket, unless you're willing and able to, of course. While most blankets featured on this list will set you back hundreds of dollars, you can order a well-made weighted blanket that costs under $45, depending on the size you choose. Tranquility, a popular brand among BETTER readers, created an affordable, temperature-regulated weighted blanket, meaning it keeps you cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Plus, you can order it at various weights between 12 and 20 pounds.

When it comes to easy-access workouts, walking and running definitely top the list. You’ll burn calories and improve your heart health — without the need for any fancy equipment, expensive gym memberships, or any sort of “30-day” plan. All you need is your own body and a pair of shoes.

But of course, there’s a catch. That pair of shoes is super important for making the most out of your walk, run or hike. Without a proper pair, you’ll risk injury, discomfort and pain; while the right ones can make you feel like you’re flying.

SKIP AHEAD: Best shoes for running, walking and hiking and trail running

Unfortunately, it can be a Goldilocks-esque challenge to find just the right pair. Take it from Katie Dunlop, certified trainer and creator of Love Sweat Fitness, who has tried hundreds of different shoes. “Some are super cute, but don’t offer any real support to your poor feet, while others are completely functional, but not exactly stylish,” she said.

To help you narrow down your decision, we asked avid runners and fitness professionals to tell us the shoes they swear by. Read on for 13 top picks.

Best running shoes

Cameron Yuen, certified strength and conditioning specialist and senior physical therapist at Bespoke Treatments, picked this pair as his go-to running shoe. “When you run, you want to minimize the amount of time your foot spends on the ground — otherwise, the contact time slows you down and puts more stress on the soft tissues,” he explained. “Since the Pegasus is a bit more responsive, you can help propel yourself a bit quicker off the ground.”

Have a need for speed? “This shoe makes me feel faster than fast,” said Emily Abbate, a running coach and writer who has run the New York Marathon. “Super light at only 6 ounces, the 1400v6 has the responsiveness I crave when I’m trying to pick up the pace. Plus, a locked-in feel courtesy of a structured upper with support cage for a secure mid foot.”

If you’re racking up the miles for a half-marathon or other endurance event, check these out.

“I own about 80 pairs of sneakers, and choose this one almost every day for runs between three and 13 miles,” said Abbate. “At 7.1 ounces, it’s lightweight but still packs enough cushion — using Asics Flytefoam technology — for me to rack up the mileage without foot pain.” The women’s sneakers are no longer in stock, but the men’s shoes are still available.

“This sneaker is not only extremely comfortable and affordable, but they also look great,” said Wes Meserve, the Run Coordinator at Life Time Athletic Burlington. “I need a shoe that is neutral with cushion, a small drop, looks great, and is affordable. This shoe has all of that.” He also points to Saucony’s ISOFIT technology, which conforms to your feet for a sock-like feel.

Dunlop’s favorite sneaker is another Saucony style. With great ankle support and plenty of cushioning, this is a solid pair for long distance runs, she said, noting, “they feel like you’re running on a cloud, but they’re still very lightweight.” Plus, the ISOFIT and new FORMFIT technologies help the shoe adapt its shape based on your running style.”

This shoe has been around forever — and for good reason, according to Meserve. “The Ghost is great for new runners as well as long runs,” he said. In this latest edition, Brooks has extended the foam midsole, which heel-strikers love since the transition from heel to toe is quicker with solid protection. “Another great feature of this shoe is the traction — I have never slipped once in the rain or snow,” Meserve added.

Best walking shoes

“Nike Cortez have always been my favorite walking around shoe — it’s casual, but still stylish,” Meserve said. “They have been around forever, and I have been wearing them ever since I was about 15 years old.” They’re not only durable, affordable and last forever, but they come in many different color combos, like Black, Metallic Silver and White and Varsity Red and White, so you can choose whatever suits your style.

For a versatile shoe that looks good and feels good on your foot, check out AllBirds Wool Runners. But don’t let the name fool you. These kicks are best suited for walking — or really anything, from running errands to an outdoor date. “They’re made from merino sheep wool which makes them very comfortable — you don’t even need socks!” Meserve said. “Another great thing is that they do not get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter, they are just right in all conditions.” These AllBirds sneaks are also available for women, including limited edition colors like Orchard, Storm and Jackalberry.

Best shoes for hiking and trail running

“Trail running requires shoes with more support, stability, traction and protection, as most injuries are the result of missing a step due to varied terrain,” Yuen said. These shoes provide all of the above, and are still relatively lightweight. It also has enough cushioning to transition to a longer hike or walk combined with trail running, he added.

As an avid runner living in Utah, I know firsthand that trail running — especially at altitude — isn’t easy. Luckily, these shoes make it feel way easier than it should. These are super lightweight and flexible kicks with a zero drop, designed to help improve natural running and walking form and toe splay. Note: If you’re new to zero-drop footwear, start by wearing these on shorter runs and hikes, then gradually build up to regular mileage.

“This is a great pair of hiking boots for everyday hikers since they are lightweight, waterproof and extremely breathable,” Meserve said. The toe protection in the front of the shoe helps keep your toes happy even on the longest hikes. “These boots also have a new internal support mechanism that provides great arch support, as well as excellent traction,” he added. The final selling point? With built-in odor control, they’re less likely to get smelly after a long hike.

Vasque has built upon their years of footwear experience to bring this boot to the next level in terms of comfort and performance. I hiked 20 miles over two days in these boots, and I didn’t need to break them in at all — they were insanely comfortable and supportive over the two-day trek. The boots’ Gore-Tex waterproof membrane guarantees protection against wet or muddy trails, while also letting your feet breathe.

Sure, Moab is a town in southern Utah. But according to Merrell, Moab also means “mother of all boots.” And this boot definitely lives up to its name. It provides an insole that’s contoured to your foot, as well as heel cushioning to absorb shock and provide stability. “This cushioning helps to limit the pressure and any pain after hiking in the heel area,” Meserve noted. “I am also a huge fan of the Vibram soles, which this boot has.”

361,The 11 best smart products to help you stay hydrated all day,"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices. If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

At some point, most of us have had “drink more water” on our to-do list. But most of us also know that increasing your daily water intake is easier said than done. As we spend more time at home, keeping a pitcher full of water nearby makes things more convenient and can encourage us to drink more throughout the day. But there are also other steps that we can take to help.

Our first plan of attack? Make it less boring. After all, you've never forgotten an iced latte or glass of lemonade at the start of work, right? By infusing water with fruit, veggies and herbs like mint and rosemary you’ll have a beverage your taste buds actually enjoy, making it more likely you'll sip more frequently.

The second step: Invest in some items that will make the whole thing a no-brainer, like drinking water reminder apps, smart water bottles and more. By taking advantage of a smart product designed to help you hit your recommended water intake, you’ll keep your goal front of center and sip more throughout the day (instead of trying to guzzle all 64 ounces before you go to bed), without having to add yet another thing to your mental to-do list.

Here's a water bottle worth having in the cabinet. It comes with an infuser to hold sliced fruit, veggies and herbs for all-natural (and sugar-free) flavor. Suddenly the beverage known for being the most boring gets a little more interesting — and the bottle solves the issue of sucking up pulp and herbs while you sip. Plus, making your own flavored water at home is a money saver. A smarter choice for your health and your bank account.

Sometimes we’re sipping our water bottle on the go, other times we prefer a nice glass of ice water at home. Plus, don’t forget that other beverages like coffee and tea count towards your daily fluid intake. Enter Ulla. The tracker that you can place on any bottle, cup or to-go mug so that you get credit for every single sip. The tracker knows when you take a drink, and begins to blink after your cup of choice sits stagnant for 40 minutes, reminding you to take a sip. If you struggle to make drinking water throughout the day a habit, and are easily sucked into work, zoom meetings and errands, this tracker will help encourage you to hydrate regularly (without having to think about it).

Another way to keep water interesting? Make it fizzy. Unfortunately buying packs of seltzer can be pricey (not to mention a pain to lug up the stairs to your apartment). Luckily for you, SodaStream solves both of those problems by enabling you to whip up some carbonated water in your kitchen whenever the craving hits. And the fizzy beverage may indeed be effective at aiding hydration: a study conducted by the company found that that SodaStream users consume 43 percent more water than non-users. Plus, it’s lightweight and wireless — which means we’ll be bringing it out on our patio for refreshing sparkling water, or a bubbly cocktail mixer during virtual happy hour. SodaStream recently partnered with sparkling water brand bubly to create fruit-flavored drops you can add to the fizzy water, too.

This isn’t your standard bottle of water. It glows to remind you to take a drink! A sensor inside the bottle measures how much water you're drinking and sends that data to a companion app that will suggest ways to improve your water drinking habits over time. The BPA-free and food safe bottle even syncs with your phone to help you find it if you've misplaced it.

If you love UV sanitizing devices, this might be your next bottle. LARQ's bottlecap is equipped with UV-C LED lights that are designed to purify up to 99.99 percent of contaminates in your water. The bottle is set to self-clean every two hours and its double-walled vacuum insulation keeps drinks cold for 24 hours or hot for 12 hours.

This 32-ounce Hydro Flask features durable stainless steel and double wall vacuum insulation to keep your water cold. It's equipped with a wide mouth and features a flexible straw lid so you can easily sip throughout the day. It's also dishwasher-friendly and comes in a variety of colors, including cobalt, hibiscus and more.

The Life Bottle holds one gallon of water, making it possible to hydrate all day without multiple trips to the kitchen. It comes with time measurements, from morning to evening, so you can easily assess your progress. Although it's quite bulky, you can fill it up once at the start of your day and likely don't need to worry about refilling it again.

Sometimes all it takes to implement a new habit is having it front and center — like that basket of fruit on the counter or setting your gym clothes out the night before. The same can be said for having a big jug of freshly-filtered water sitting on your counter or in your fridge, ready to pour into a glass. This “smart” pitcher is power-activated so it instantly filters a one-gallon (or 16-cup) carafe without the painful drip by drip process of your standard water pitchers. Added bonus: It removes 10 times more contaminants, including over 99 percent of lead, according to the brand. The one-gallon dispenser is perfect for the counter, while the half-gallon (8 cup) dispenser fits in the refrigerator door.

Many of us fail to have a bottle of water on hand when we need it most — when we’re outside being active on a hot day. But we get it: the last thing anyone wants to do when riding their bike, heading out on a weekend hike or spending the day at the beach is lug around a cumbersome bottle. That’s where the Vapur comes in handy. Dubbed the “anti-bottle,” it’s made of a flexible material that lays flat when it's empty. So once you drink the water, you can fold it up and store it in a pocket or bag without adding any bulk to your load. You can also opt for a detachable hose, perfect for hands-free hydrating during your run or hike.

362,Cleaning this weekend? This interactive room-by-room guide will make it easier,"If deep cleaning is an item that never seems to get checked off your weekend to-do list, now's the perfect time to tackle a few of those niggling tasks. This guide assumes you've got a regular cleaning system in the works — whether it's a weekend marathon cleaning session (guilty) or a regular weekday routine — so instead we've focused on four to eight things in each room you're probably not doing on a weekly or monthly basis — or you're just overlooking all together (just look up at that dingy ceiling fan).

We've found a few better ways to make deep(ish) cleaning even easier — in many cases, using supplies you already have in your pantry or dresser drawer (think: baking soda and vinegar and an old pair of socks). To get started, just click on the circles on the graphic of each room to see the item and then click over to the story to see how it's done.

367,Why rapper Killer Mike's next big project is starting a bank,"In the wake of the death of George Floyd — as the Black community in Atlanta reacted to another senseless killing at the hands of the police — Killer Mike, the rapper and activist, asked his neighbors to resist rioting and take a different kind of action. “If you sit in your homes tonight, instead of burning your home to the ground, you will have time to properly plot, plan, strategize and organize and mobilize in an effective way,” he said. For months he's been encouraging others to take their anger and turn it into productive action.

Now he is channeling his own advice and teaming up with former Atlanta mayor and civil rights icon, Andrew Young, to start a digital bank to serve Black and Latino communities who are underserved by the financial services industry.

When we say underserved, here’s what that looks like: About 17 percent of Black households don’t have bank accounts compared to just 3 percent of white households. And Black-owned small businesses are about half as likely to obtain bank loans as white-owned businesses.

Young and Killer Mike’s new plan, the Greenwood Bank Initiative, is hoping to change exactly that. Killer Mike joined me on MSNBC — and later on a panel at Operation HOPE’s annual meeting — to discuss how he plans to revolutionize banking in Black and Latino communities.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

STEPHANIE RUHLE: Mike, when you told people to get active and be productive, I think most of us thought you were talking about social justice. Why start a bank?

KILLER MIKE: Well, they go hand in hand. You can't have social justice without social equality. And in a capitalistic society, if those who capitalism was built on bear the sins of people who have been enslaved here and the people who are being used as cheap labor now, if those people don't get an active role in capitalism or the opportunity to participate, then what are we left with but a permanent underclass?

I believe that part of social justice is making sure that economic justice happens.

RUHLE: I want to go with a false narrative. People who might say, well, these Black households maybe just don't have the money for a bank account. That is not true. They are not underbanked because they don't have enough money for a bank account. In the United States, we don't offer financial literacy as part of our education system. And there's not equal access.

KILLER MIKE: Absolutely.

RUHLE: Is that why you're doing this?

KILLER MIKE: Absolutely. I was fortunate to be raised by people that were born in 1922 and 1932. My grandparents raised me. My grandmother's family had been a sharecropping family that earned enough money to buy their own farm, buy their own land.

She came from a more financially secure background than my grandfather, whose dad left when he was in third grade and he was left there to essentially leave school and take care of his sisters.

I learned that financial literacy was important. We were marched into a bank as early as five, six and eight years old. Me and my sister started our first bank account. We were taught by my grandmother to balance our checkbooks. I was the worst at it. My sister, who was the best at it, is an accountant at a corporation now. I have to hire her and people like her.

But I learned very early to take care of your coin and your coin will take care of you. I was fortunate to be in a household where that happens — but that can be taught to kindergartners, third graders, sixth-seventh graders and all through high school.

And I think that that should be a part of not just home economics once you get to high school, it should be a part of our fundamental education from the time we're in kindergarten forward.

RUHLE: Me, too. I was rolling pennies on rainy days with my grandmother.

The Greenwood Initiative: Talk us through what happened in Greenwood because it is a tragic stain on American history that not enough people understand.

KILLER MIKE: There have been many tragic stains on American history in relation to the group of people called Blacks in America and this is one of them that I think is curable and fixable.

About 100 years ago, there was a community called Greenwood in Tulsa, and due to racism, bigotry, hatred and violence, it was destroyed. It was celebrated as a Black Wall Street because Blacks that had newly been freed were helping the country expand West.

They created this system in which they had their own schools, their own churches, their own doctors and dentists. They had everything any other community has to be successful. They turned a dollar 36 times in that community before that dollar left. So that dollar landed in my business to help enrich me and help me to employ people to enrich them.",0

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

Sometimes it seems like the world is conspiring against your ability to get some sleep. The birds, as lovely as they are, start chirping way too early and the landscapers and car-honkers always seem to follow suit. That construction zone down the street somehow sounds as if it were directly outside your window, that late night that went way too long, and to top it all off, news about the coronavirus can be unsettling.

While many external factors aren’t within your control, you can do a few things to help lull yourself to sleep faster and, once you're there, ensure that your sleep is the kind that will have you feeling energized the next morning. We tapped medical and sleep experts for advice on how to get more zzz’s — and the products that will help you doze off.

Guided meditation for sleep: Where to start?

You’ve heard this advice ad nauseam, but there’s a reason meditation has been prescribed to treat the human condition since roughly 1500 BCE. “The art of falling asleep is actually not trying so hard,” says Alex Dimitriu, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and sleep medicine expert. “Knowing how to clear your thoughts and focus on breathing will always help. The trick is to practice by day — not when it's mission-critical at 3 a.m.” Meditation can be as simple as sitting in a quiet space and taking meaningful, deliberate breaths or listening to your favorite music for five minutes.

For some guidance, try Headspace, an app that works on both Android and Apple devices, and walks you through mindful sessions. There's even a special category for Sleep Sounds and Meditations to try while attempting to get some shut eye. Headspace has nearly 678,000 reviews and a 4.9-star average rating on iTunes.

Techies might find solace in the highly-rated Muse 2, which is designed to sense brain activity, heart rate, breathing and movement to help guide you through meditation routines. The device pairs with your Bluetooth headphones and has a micro-USB port, offering up to five hours of power.

Eliminate allergens in the bedroom: How to pick the best air purifier

The accumulation of allergens in your bedroom can contribute to subpar sleep. “Reducing your exposure to allergens — such as dust mites, pollen and pet dander — while you sleep will reduce itchy watery eyes, eczema, nasal congestion, and coughing,” says Purvi Parikh, MD, an allergist and immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network. “The bedroom is (the) most important place to keep allergen-free since we spend most time at once there.” To help, keep windows closed during peak-pollen seasons, keep pets off the bed, wash your bedding and dust and sweep once a week. Parikh adds any HEPA air purifier will help combat mold and animal dander.

When it comes to the best air purifiers, BETTER found that while this air purifier is a splurge, it can purify a room up to 700 square feet. Clifford Bassett, MD, a board-certified doctor in New York, said he likes this brand because it makes customizable filters that address odors, toxins or pet allergens. MinusA2 isn’t just quiet, the sleek design can also be mounted on a wall.

This is another option that’s been certified “asthma and allergy friendly” by the AAFA. It features a HEPA and carbon filter that traps particles as small as 0.3 microns. “The most harmful particulates are the smallest, or less than 2.5 microns in size,” says Denitza Blagev, MD, a pulmonologist at Intermountain Medical Center in Salt Lake City, Utah.

And since pollen and dust mites are too small to be filtered, Parikh also recommends a dust mite cover that zips around your mattress and box spring. To help simplify your search for mattress protectors, we rounded up a few highly-rated options on Amazon.

Sporting a 4.3-star average rating from more than 3,000 reviewers on Amazon, this mattress protector prevents allergens, bed bugs, dust mites and even sweat from damaging your mattress. The machine-washable encasement comes with a 10-year warranty and has Micro-Zipper technology, which the brand says helps prevent bed bugs from sneaking through the zipper's teeth.

The American-made protector from Brooklyn Bedding offers up hypoallergenic protection against bed bugs, dust mites and bacteria along with zip-tight construction to help protect your mattress. It’s machine-washable and made from waterproof materials to help prevent liquid damage to your mattress.

Can blue light-blocking glasses help you avoid blue light?

We’re surrounded by blue light via smart phones and light bulbs, and it notably contributes to wakefulness. “Your body needs to know that it's nighttime so it can prepare for sleep. This is why, when you are camping, it's hard to stay awake,” says Amy Serin, a neuropsychologist and author of ""The Stress Switch."" “The brain uses sunlight to know when it's day or night, but unfortunately artificial light can trick your body into thinking it's daytime. It's not just your screens doing it — lamps and overhead lighting trick your brain as well.”

Camping every single night (or resisting the urge to scroll Instagram) isn’t an option for most of us, but blue-light filtering glasses can help.

In 2019, Oprah Winfrey included these $25 blue light glasses in her annual list of Oprah’s Favorite Things. PeeperSpecs says these affordable reading glasses offer 40-percent Blue Light protection along with 99% UVA and UVB light protection. These spectacles have seven layers of anti-reflective coating and a dual anti-scratch coating, which is particularly helpful if you tend to drop your glasses.

With more than a dozen color options and a 4.3-star average rating from more than 18,300 reviewers, these fashionable blue-light glasses on Amazon are worth hitting add to cart. Tijn says these light-weight spectacles offer 100-percent protection against UV rays thanks to the lenses' yellow tint. The square-shaped frames have curved edges, making the design particularly flattering to those with oval faces.

How to fall asleep faster by eliminating the drama around you

A spike in cortisol, also known as the stress hormone, can contribute to an inability to fall asleep. For that reason, it’s best to eliminate all sources of stress before going to bed. That includes highly dramatic TV shows and movies (save the ""American Horror Story"" for the afternoon), stressful text messages or conversations, and racing thoughts. “Because sleep is dependent on nervous system regulation, reducing stress and restoring someone to a state of calm can promote sleep onset, and can help someone go back to sleep if they wake up prematurely during the night,"" says Serin. ""Anything relaxing can help someone fall asleep like gentle music, aromatherapy and deep breathing, meditation, even journaling and winding down with herbal tea before bed can help.""

Dimitriu adds: ""If you can't fall asleep within 20 minutes, get out of bed and do something boring and relaxing. A dim light and a book are ideal.”

Here are some products that fit the bill and might help you unwind before going to bed.

Nearly 49,000 reviewers have left an average 4.4-star rating for this essential oil diffuser available in four colors — White, Yellow, Brown, and White/Grey — and has seven mood light settings. Add a few drops of calming lavender essential oil to 100 ml of water to help you decompress while laying in bed. The quiet diffusers offer up to five hours of continuous use when unplugged from the included charging device.

If you want an essential oil diffuser that will disperse calming scents while you sleep, then try this option from Asakuki, which lasts up to 16 hours. You can also set a timer for 60, 120 or 180 minutes or if you prefer you can press a button to activate the built-in humidifier which helps to keep your skin moist in dry weather. The 1.5 lbs aromatherapy device has more than 11,100 reviews and has a 4.6-star average rating.

This Nightly Valerian Relaxation Tea is meant to promote a good night's sleep. It contains one box with 16 sealed tea bags and is non-GMO certified. The flavors of the tea have earthy and minty tones. Over 2,700 Amazon shoppers gave this product a 4.4-star average rating.

If you find listening to white noise is soothing or just open to trying a new remedy to help lull you to sleep, consider Marpac Dohm Connect's white noise machine. It is paired with app-enabled technology so you can power, control volume settings and set a sleep schedule all from your phone. There are two-speed options available for adjustable tone and volume so you can create a personalized sound environment.

How to stay cool in your bed while you sleep

“Your body naturally wants to cool down as you enter deep sleep, and anything you can do that increases this cooling helps with getting deeper, more restorative sleep,” says Dimitriu. This can be as simple as taking a warm shower about an hour before bed, which triggers your body to lower its internal temperature. Dimitriu is a self-proclaimed minimalist and encourages his patients ""to keep their sleep routines simple and straightforward,"" rather than relying on devices to improve sleep.

""Quite simply a comfortable bed (softer for side sleepers), and a good pillow to match can help,"" he says. ""While cooling pads and blankets are available, it might just be simplified to using a light enough blanket made of breathable fabric to facilitate good cooling and breathability."" Dimitriu also advises keeping your bedroom below 70 degrees to help your sleep.

If you are still interested in testing out cooling bedding, there is an entire range of products out there you can use to sleep more comfortably.

The Buffy Cloud Comforter is constructed from hypoallergenic eucalyptus fibers, which Buffy says is more breathable than cotton. 100-percent recycled materials were used to fill the comforter, which can help regulate body temperature. Nearly 960 reviewers left an average 4.2-star rating on this fluffy comforter.

Nest Bedding’s Cooling Mattress Topper cools you while you sleep (while adding extra comfort) with two inches of their SmartFlow Gel Memory Foam. The cover layer is made from a synthetic blend of materials which helps keep you dry throughout the night.

If you're in the market for a new mattress, but not ready to splurge on a smart bed, consider this sustainable option from Brooklyn Bedding. It's made from sustainable wool and organic cotton and you have the choice of three levels of firmness — Soft, Medium and Firm — to ensure your snug while sleeping.

369,Buying an Instant Pot? Here's what you need to know,"Our editors independently selected these items because we think you will enjoy them and might like them at these prices. If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

Over the past few years, Instant Pots have become a staple in small kitchen appliances. Busy parents use them to get dinner on the table in minutes, while batch cookers use them to simplify midweek meals. Some people prefer them for their ability to cook just about everything from pot roast to yogurt. Staying home has become the new norm to help prevent coronavirus from spreading, so you're probably using your time indoors to cook more and try out new recipes. Alongside summer cooking staples like grills, an Instant Pot is a relatively quick, easy and affordable way to whip up home-cooked meals while under quarantine. Here's everything you should know about an Instant pot, including how it works, best Instant Pots to buy and more.

“A few years ago the idea that people would be cooking in pressure cookers en masse was unthinkable,” says Elizabeth Barbone, a cookbook author and the creator of the pressure-cooker blog Cook Fast, Eat Well. “It’s been really fun to see folks not only embrace it, but to embrace it in different ways.”

Instant Pots typically range anywhere between $60 to over $100 depending on the model’s size, cooking capabilities and other design features. As you may know, tech and electronics are traditionally high-savings categories during major sale events like Black Friday and Cyber Week. Even a new sale like Amazon’s Big Summer Sale, which is currently active until Sept. 7, is slashing prices on small kitchen appliances, including Instant Pots.

WHAT ARE INSTANT POTS?

Instant Pots are a brand of electric pressure cookers or multicookers. Pressure cookers work by creating heat under a tight seal, so the temperature is much higher than the boiling point of water and the steam can’t escape. The steam cooks food much more quickly than traditional stovetop or oven cooking.

“It’s like a Crock Pot on steroids,” says Brittany Williams, founder and creator of Instant Loss and author of Instant Loss: Eat Real, Lose Weight. “You can put everything in there and walk away.”

DO THEY REALLY COOK THAT FAST?

According to Bruce Weinstein, coauthor of ""The Instant Pot Bible,"" the answer is yes. ""Under high heat and pressure, things cook much faster. You can cook a brisket or pulled pork in under an hour,"" he says. “The claims sound outlandish — it reduces cooking time by 70 percent — but that’s because of the steam and the pressure,” Barbone says.

There are a couple of caveats, though. You need to add in the time it takes the machine to come up to pressure, usually 15 or 20 minutes.

And for some dishes, you’ll want the pressure to dissipate gradually. That can take five to 40 minutes depending on the dish. “For meat-based dishes, I like to release the pressure naturally for at least 10 minutes. If you release it right away the meat can seize up and become tough,” Williams says.

ARE ELECTRIC PRESSURE COOKERS SAFE?

Years ago, stovetop pressure cookers got a bad reputation for their lids being relatively easy to remove before the pressure released, which runs the risk of burns and messes. “You could end up with soup on your ceiling,” says Williams.

To avoid those issues, modern electric models are equipped with built-in safety features that prevent you from releasing the lid while the pressure is still high.

“Pressure cookers are safe, but we need to be following good practices,” Barbone says. Some of the things you might see on the Internet, like covering the steam release valve to protect cabinets or walls from steam, aren’t safe. Instead, position your pot accordingly if that’s a concern.

And don’t fill your Instant Pot more than about halfway. You need the pot empty enough to get to a safe pressure and remain safe throughout your cooking time.

WHAT FEATURES DO I NEED?

Multicookers include the pressure cooker plus other additional features. You’ll see names like 6-in-1 or 10-in-1, depending on how many of these other options they add:

High- and low-pressure

Slow cooker

Rice/porridge cooker

Cake maker

Yogurt maker

Sauté/sear feature

Steamer

Warmer

Sterilizer

Air fryer

Altitude adjuster

The sauté setting is popular. Instead of sautéing in one pan and transferring your food to another pot, you can use the Instant Pot the same way you use an electric skillet, Weinstein says.

If you want to make delicate vegetables or cream-based soups, you might want a pot with a low-pressure option. Likewise, if you’ll do canning, you want a pot with that capability. And if Bluetooth connectivity and high-end electronics are a must, you can choose more advanced models that sport those features.

The Instant Pot line includes a range of models — Lux, Duo, Viva, Ultra, Smart Wifi, and Max. With over 10 options to choose from, you’ll need to determine what features you want to know which model is the right fit for you.

Another consideration? If you plan to leave your Instant Pot out on your countertop, you might want to factor in the different colors and designs you can choose with different models.

WHAT IF I JUST WANT A PRESSURE COOKER?

“A lot of people are not interested in all those other things — they just want something that can cook their dinner,” Weinstein says.

If this sounds like you, you may want to check out this pressure cooker by Cuisinart rather than a multicooker. If you only foresee using your device for pressure cooking and aren’t interested in all the extra bells and whistles, you might even find a better price by going in that direction.

Just keep in mind when following an Instant Pot recipe, it may take a few extra minutes to cook if you're not using one of the Instant Pot multicookers, which tends to get hotter than most other pressure cookers.

WHAT SIZE DO I NEED?

The 6-quart option is well-liked because it is the size most recipes are designed for and can feed families of up to five. If you’re looking to create side dishes, or feed one to two people, the 3-quart mini may be right for you. On the other hand, if you’re cooking for large families or crowds, want to get ahead of meal prep for the week or are looking to cook large cuts of meat, you might want to consider the 8- or 10-quart options.

“With the 8-quart it’s hard to make things for one or two people, because you have to have a certain amount in there to work properly and create pressure,” Weinstein says.

The 3-quart is a good choice for smaller spaces or as a side pot for smaller dishes.

I’VE HEARD FOOD BURNS SOMETIMES. HOW CAN I AVOID THAT?

Williams says the burn sensor is more sensitive in newer, higher pressure models. The liquid ratio is key, so if you notice that there’s not enough liquid, or your sauce is too thick, you may run into burning.

“In testing recipes that has happened to me a few times,” Weinstein says. He adds, using canned tomatoes packed in juice vs. packed in puree can make a difference.

“The best way to avoid that is to follow tested recipes,” he says. “If it hasn’t been tested, you might end up with a burn.”

It’s also best to put your liquids and the foods that will release the most water on the bottom of the pot and wait until after your dish is cooked to stir everything together.

Make sure you are using a recipe designed for the size pot you have. You could run into burning if you’re using a recipe designed for a 6-quart pot in an 8-quart pot.

HOW DO I GET STARTED?

If you’re new to an Instant Pot, follow the user manual and heat water in your pot as an initial test run. Barbone recommends that you listen to the sound of a pressure cooker coming to pressure. “The steam will sort of violently come out of the valve. If you’ve never heard it before, it can be a little startling,” he says.

After that, try cooking something simple and inexpensive like rice, Williams says. Then move on to something like a broth-based soup. “Start with something simple. Don’t start with a rack of ribs for your first recipe. Do something affordable so if it doesn’t work out, you’re not ruining something that’s really pricey,” Barbone says.

HOW DO I CLEAN MY INSTANT POT?

Cleaning your instant pot is easy — You take out the liner and lid and wash with dish soap and warm water. You can also run it through the dishwasher for convenience. Some shoppers have found the sealing ring for the lid traps scents, and they like to have two on hand, one for sweet dishes and one for savory foods. To combat any lingering odors, store the lid upside down or run the pot using the steam function with a little vinegar and lemon juice.

If you scald the bottom of your pot, Williams recommends the powder version of Barkeepers Friend.

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

While you may have left your love for emo music behind in high school, acne isn’t always something you can say goodbye to so easily. Acne is becoming increasingly more common in adults, with up to 15 percent of women affected—and dry or oily skin can also have similar effects on your skin.

So what causes acne, exactly? “When skin pores get clogged, usually by dead skin cells, oil cannot discharge and accumulates in the pore and under the skin, creating a whitehead or blackhead,” explains Viseslav Tonkovic-Capin, MD, a Kansas City dermatologist and editor DermBoard.org. “This is a perfect environment for [the bacteria] Propionibacterium acnes, which then flourishes and causes inflammation, creating pimples.”

IN THIS ARTICLE Best ingredients | Best products

Alison Tam, a board-certified dermatologist in Las Vegas, says hormonal changes like perimenopause or menopause, or the use of hormones like testosterone, can cause adult acne. “Adult onset acne may also have no cause, which is extremely common, and progress from just a few pimples to full cystic acne over the course of months to years,” she says.

Best ingredients for acne-prone skin

Controlling acne can be difficult, depending on the severity of your condition, but it’s not impossible. Derms swear by a few ingredients, including salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide and Adapalene. While they vary in their chemical compounds, each ingredient can help you achieve your acne-free skin care goals.

Salicylic acid

“Salicylic acid exfoliates the stratum corneum (outer layer of skin) and penetrates into pores to remove sebum,” says Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. This helps to prevent pores from being clogged and can help remove clogs that have already formed.""

Salicylic acid is a beta hydroxy acid, meaning it's a chemical exfoliator.

According to King, salicylic acid is gentle enough for sensitive skin types to use.

""It dissolves the bonds that hold dull, dead skin cells on the surface of the skin so the skin will gently shed, revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath,"" says King. Salicylic acid isn’t limited to your face — it’s a beneficial ingredient found in dry scalp and dandruff shampoos, too.

Benzoyl peroxide

""Benzoyl peroxide is helpful for treating acne not only because it kills bacteria that contribute to acne, but because it helps prevent and clear out clogged pores,"" explains King.

King advises looking out for micronized formulas because they cause less irritation and have a longer shelf life.

Benzoyl peroxide can bleach your clothes and towels, so it's best to use cleansers with this ingredient in the shower.

Adapalene

An OTC retinoid can help manage acne, as well, says King.

Retinoids regulate skin cell turnover to keep pores free of oil and inflammation at bay.

Adapalene is the first OTC retinoid, and it's available in 0.1-percent and 0.3-percent strength.

When shopping for skincare products for acne-prone skin, King advises that you buy non-comedogenic items because they won’t clog pores. Tam adds that you should cleanse with gentle face wash twice a day.“Harsh cleansers can strip too much oil and can have the opposite effect, over-stimulating your oil glands,” says Tam. “This may leave you feeling good right away but make you oilier over time.” Follow up cleansing with a non-comedogenic moisturizer and sunscreen (in the morning), suggests Tam.

When using an acne treatment like benzoyl peroxide or retinoid, you only need a small amount, about a pea size, for your entire face, says Nancy Samolitis, a board-certified dermatologist and co-founder and medical director of Facile Dermatology + Boutique. Because these treatments are powerful, you should limit application to once a day, Samolitis advises.

If over-the-counter products aren't working for you, consider seeing a dermatologist or your general practitioner who can help you explore other treatment options, including prescription medications. For adult women, birth control pills with low-dose estrogen and progesterone are often helpful, says Melanie Palm, MD, a dermatologist in San Diego.

Best products for acne-prone skin

Ready to take the first step in getting your acne under control? Below, top dermatologists share their favorite skin care products for acne-prone skin. Here’s to clearer skin days ahead!

“This (non-comedogenic) cleanser contains salicylic acid to clean out pores and calm acne,” says Palm. There's also glycolic acid, a popular type of Alpha Hydroxy Acid, which leads to more even-toned skin and Lipo Hydroxy Acid, which removes excess oil, leaving your skin shine-free. It's suitable for most skin types — acne-prone, oily, combination and sensitive — because it's free of oils, fragrances and parabens. Those with dry or normal skin might find this gel cleanser too dehydrating for regular use.

“This is an excellent benzoyl peroxide product,” says King. With 2.5% micronized benzoyl peroxide it’s effective yet gentle. The cleanser also contains glycerin, a hydrating ingredient. “This is a great cleanser choice if you have a combination of some clogged pore type of acne with whiteheads and blackheads and some inflammatory acne with bigger pink or red pimples,” she says.

Cleanse your face twice daily with Samolitis's pick. MicroClear technology combines 2-percent salicylic acid with oil-dissolving ingredients, unclogging pores and preventing acne-causing buildup. Neutrogena says those with mild to moderate acne will see results within 24 hours because the proprietary technology helps push the ingredients deep into pores.

This device will help you wash your face more effectively, says Palm. A timer tells you when to move on to the next area of your face. It’s also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower. Since Clarisonic is going out of business on September 30, PMD's Clean Smart Facial Cleansing Device is a similar option to consider. The brush is made of silicone, meaning it’s waterproof, antibacterial and odor-resistant. It also vibrates 7,000 times per minute to help remove oil and dirt in your skin, which helps to prevent future breakouts.

Charcoal and 2% salicylic acid pack a one-two punch against pimples, plus the gritty texture provides physical exfoliation to unclog pores. “This is an ideal cleanser choice if you have oily skin and clogged pores with whiteheads and blackheads, without many inflammatory pimples,” says King. It’s also a good alternative to benzoyl peroxide if that’s something your skin can’t tolerate well, she adds.

Emmy M. Graber, MD, a dermatologist and president of the Dermatology Institute of Boston, explains that most benzoyl peroxide products contain 10 percent of the ingredient, but higher strengths have never been proven to be better for acne. “Higher strengths only irritate the skin more, so you should look for a lower strength,” says Graber, who is a fan of this product. It contains 3.5 percent benzoyl peroxide and can be used as a daily cleanser or weekly mask to kill bacteria and prevent future breakouts.

Toning isn’t an essential skin care step, but it can help remove pore-clogging debris from your skin. Samolitis likes this toner because it’s alcohol-free, meaning it won’t strip skin of essential moisture. Lactic and citric acids remove dead skin cells, while aloe soothes.

Graber suggests this toner because witch hazel helps control oil production, relieves inflammation and shrinks the appearance of pores. The fragrance-free, all-natural formula is gentle enough for sensitive skin types, although those with oily, combination and acne-prone skin will find it beneficial as well. The brand says it doubles as a makeup remover, although you may want to avoid using it to wipe away eye makeup.

Don’t think you can skip out on moisturizer if you have acne. It’s all about finding one that’s right for your skin type. This one, a favorite of Samolitis, is formulated with niacinamide to hold moisture in and prevent excess oil production while cucumber soothes irritation. The moisturizer looks thick in the jar yet feels lightweight and soaks into skin with ease.

Sunscreen is an essential step, regardless of your skin type, the weather or you're working indoors. Palm recommends the non-comedogenic formula, which is free of heavy moisturizers that could clog pores. “Zinc oxide and niacinamide are anti-inflammatory and do not promote oil production,” she says. Elta MD's sunscreen offers broad-spectrum protection against the sun's UVA and UVB rays, which cause signs of aging and sun damage.

It might seem counterintuitive to apply oil to your face if you have acne, but this one, which Samolitis likes, is formulated specifically to treat blemishes. Blue tansy is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, minimizing redness associated with acne, while azulene soothes the skin and kukui nut oil balances sebum production. The deep blue oil is best suited for those with oily, combination and acne-prone skin over dry and normal skin types.

“This face mask contains sulfur, the oldest known ingredient to help with skin inflammation,” says Graber. The combo of sulfur and zinc oxide in this mask draw out impurities and gets rid of excess oil, while calamine and cucumber extract cool skin and ensure you don’t feel irritated afterward. Apply the mask either two or three times a week and let it dry on your face for about 15 to 20 minutes. You can also use it as a spot treatment on stubborn breakouts.

Palm says this no-rinse mask is gentle yet effective, with ingredients including lactic and glycolic acids (AHAs) that target pimples and heal post-inflammatory pigmentation and redness. Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital, previously told NBC News Shopping that this face mask also contains ""soy and kiwi complex to exfoliate and brighten the skin.""

Formulated with 0.1 percent retinaldehyde (a non-prescription retinoid) and soothing thermal spring water, Samolitis likes this treatment lotion that targets acne without irritating. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) Enzyme buffs away dirt and oil to help decongest pores and prevent breakouts. After you cleanse and tone your skin at night, then you can rub the lotion into your skin.

Samolitis and King recommend this OTC retinoid, which promotes skin cell turnover and curbs inflammation to deep clean pores and prevent new pimples from forming. After you cleanse, tone and moisturize, apply a thin layer of the gel treatment to the affected areas of the skin.

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

Last week, a half a bag of grapes, a container of homemade soup and a few rogue radishes I found buried at the bottom of the produce drawer all ended up in my garbage. It pains me to see produce tied up in a garbage bag for multiple reasons:

I’m well aware of how many people don’t have easy access to the fresh produce I conveniently pick up on my walk home from work.

I could have used those ingredients to create healthy meals.

I see dollar signs going right into the garbage can along with my wilting kale and mushy zucchini.

I’m not alone: In the United States, 31 percent of the available food supply at the retail and consumer levels in 2010 went uneaten. And those of us who eat a healthy eating diet are some of the biggest culprits: A study published in the journal Plos One found that the healthiest Americans are the most wasteful, because of their high consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are frequently thrown out.

While there are many factors that affect food waste, one that we have direct control over is how much we are throwing away in our own households. And I, for one, know that the organization of my fridge (or, the lack thereof) is largely to blame for my own waste. I bring home my grocery store haul and shove everything into drawers and stack them on shelves, without much rhyme or reason. And without fail on a weekly basis there is a slimy bag of greens or a half-eaten jar of tomato sauce with questionable coloring that was shoved into the back and forgotten and has to be tossed.

Certainly taking the time to put a better system in place could make a huge difference, but if my closets are any indication, my home organization skills are wanting. So I called in reinforcements.

Gilat Tunit, founder of Project Neat, a professional home organization company, says that establishing an organization system in your refrigerator is as simple as investing in a few affordable products that will make your fridge more efficient by maximizing space.

The goal is to “contain items, categorize them and separate them,” says Tunit. “It’s really important in a fridge to be able to access things. What happens to most when [storing food is] you have to move one thing out of the way to get to the other things. How many times do you open your fridge and have to pull out the entire fridge just to reach the dressing all the way in the back? We are all guilty of that process, but it’s not our fault! The options that the fridge comes with is the issue in itself. It’s basically open shelving and no real direction as to what should go where.”

“[The fridge] is the last place one imagines a possibility for organization. We assume that our fridge will just always be messy because it’s used on such a consistent basis.” says Tunit. “[People] also don’t realize how inexpensive it can be to make it organized and much more functional. A lot of times the products we can use to keep a fridge organized are the same as what we would use in a different part of our home.”

Since you’re probably spending more time at home these days, dedicate a few hours to reorganizing your refrigerator with products like mason jars, storage bins and stackable containers. Follow these expert tips from Tunit, who also shares her affordable product picks that can help optimize your fridge space — and make it easier to stock up on healthy ingredients (without any of them ending up in the trash).

What to store in it: Butter, sour cream, cream cheese, syrup, cottage cheese

Tunit calls this product a must have in every home. ""The use of products such as a lazy Susan gives you the ability to actually see everything that you have,” she says. “I suggest this for everything and anything: whether it’s your fridge or your pantry or your makeup or kid’s crayons. In my fridge I use it for condiments. There’s no rummaging, no moving things out of the way, you spin it and grab whatever you need. People think if they have a lot of stuff, they can’t organize it, but that’s not true. As long as you contain it and have everything categorized, you can have as much stuff as you want and it will still be organized.”

What to store: Fruit (strawberries, grapes, blueberries, raspberries)

“I love mason jars for fruit such as strawberries, blueberries and grapes,"" says Tunit. ""First of all , they are tall and narrow which doesn’t take shelf space. They also seal tight for lasting freshness and they are glass, which is preferable to plastic.”

What to store: Produce like peppers, yellow squash, tomatoes, small cucumbers

“There are a couple of things I love about these bins: They’re clear so you can see through them; They’re wide, which is great because you can fit a lot of stuff in there; And you’re freeing up the [produce drawer],""says Tunit. ""They have handles so it's super easy to take them in and out.""

What to store: Greek Yogurt

“This is another way to take things off of your shelves,"" says Tunit. ""It’s super easy to install — it’s literally just two little sticky tabs, take them off, and place it wherever you want in your fridge. Then you take your Greek yogurt and slide it in and it hangs — which is genius — completely off your shelving space, which frees it up.”

What to store: Grab-and-go snack foods like string cheese, fruit cups, pudding, apples (slice and separate into Ziploc baggies)

“People mostly use these for dressers and random drawers in their home, but I love it for a fridge,” says Tunit, who recommends placing them inside your produce drawer. “What you’re doing is creating separation inside of an otherwise open drawer. When it's open and you start throwing things in, you’re going to have everything mixed together. I like when everything is separated and categorized; it makes your life much easier.” She suggests using this as a snack drawer, which is especially great for people with kids. “When a child goes in and wants to pack up a lunch bag in the morning, this is an awesome way to do it.”

What to store: Deli meats; cheese

“What the pullout bin does is give you extra drawer space that you wouldn’t otherwise have,” says Tunit. “They are easy to clip on and off and you can get however many you think will fit. What I love about them is that they don’t take up actual shelf space; they hang. So you’re creating extra space without taking away any space.”

What to store: To-go avocado packs, hummus, dressing packets, veggie dip

Tunit suggests using stackable bins because “they’re narrow, not bulky, which is a space saver. They also have lids, so you’re able to stack them. You can go three, four, however many levels up you want to go based on the size of your fridge."" While she loves to use them for snack-sized containers, they are also another great way to store deli meats and cheese.

Storage ideas using products around your house

These storage ideas don’t require buying special products. Instead re-purpose things you likely already have lying around your house:

Egg carton: “This costs zero dollars, other than the eggs that come with it,” says Tunit. Once you've eaten all your eggs, simply cut off the lid of the carton and place it in the door of your fridge. ""Take condiments that are more narrow on top and flip them upside down,"" says Tunit, who adds that this is also a great trick to prevent those last drops from getting stuck at the bottom of your ketchup or salad dressing bottle.

Ziploc baggies: ""I love using freezer bags in the actual fridge for lots of things,"" says Tunit. ""For one, it’s the easiest thing to store marinated meats in. People often use a bowl, but that’s less efficient and also forces you to use a lot more sauces. I also love transferring produce, fruits, cheeses, etc. to bags because I feel they stay fresher longer as well as keeping everything separated."" She recommends labeling each bag to make the storage trick even more efficient.

372,9 things to do this morning to make your whole day more productive,"Some mornings everything goes right. You wake up before your alarm goes off. Your morning jog feels like playtime. The coffee tastes better. And there is no traffic on your way into the office. And when you sit down to get to work, you feel like you could conquer the world.

Other days are not like that all.

And while you can’t prevent every unfortunate a.m. situation that might come your way, experts say there are a few things you can do to encourage your mornings in that direction so you can make the most out of the rest of your day, too.

“If you wake up [energized], you’re going to carry that energy through the rest of the day,” says productivity expert and coach Ellen Goodwin. Starting your morning with little “wins” (having an outfit picked out and ready to go, working out and leaving on time) primes your brain to work toward more “wins” and successes throughout the day, Goodwin explains.

But if you start the morning off on the wrong foot, you’re already behind, she says. And that means you’ll need to use the energy you do have to get to a better emotional state, she explains. (Think back to how you calmed yourself down the last time you got caught in a traffic nightmare or public transport breakdown.)

“Energy equals willpower — and you only have so much at a given time,” she says. So the more of it you use to recover from a train delay or an alarm-didn’t-go-off morning, the less you have later for concentrating on a big project at work, family drama or whatever your day throws your way.

There are also physiological reasons you’re doing your body (and the rest of your day) a favor when your morning right. The body’s natural body clock — your circadian rhythm — runs on a roughly 24-hour cycle with the help of cues from your environment (like lightness and darkness and exercise) to help regulate sleep, energy levels, metabolism and other bodily functions. And the choices you make to start your day, from logging that early-bird workout to sleeping in for too long, either help or hurt keep that clock running on time, Namni Goel, PhD, a research associate professor in psychiatry in University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine says.

“The morning is a critical time that can set the tone for the entire day” — and your short- and long-term health, says Goel — a biological psychologist and behavioral neuroscientist who specializes in sleep, circadian rhythms and their effect on human physiology.

Here’s what Goodwin and Goel say are some of the best things you can do to start your day right.

1. Plan ahead!

One of the most productive things you can do to start your day on the right foot should actually happen before you go to sleep the previous day, Goodwin says — make a plan. It doesn’t need to be a minute-by-minute itinerary, but it should map out the major tasks or things you want to accomplish the next day — and how you want to spend the first few hours of the day.

Lay out the clothes you’ll wear and make sure you have ingredients ready to make a healthy breakfast. It helps to plan the small things that might slow you down, she adds. The idea is to avoid “decision fatigue,” she says. “Habits that get you out the door in the morning without having to stress over decisions enables you to have more willpower to make [other] decisions during the day about important things.”

2. Resist the snooze

Giving yourself a few extra minutes of slumber may seem like listening to your body, but in the long run you’re probably doing more harm than good. That’s because those 10 extra minutes of shuteye tend to be low-quality, light sleep since it’s not long enough for your body to make it through another sleep cycle (which tends to take around 90 minutes).

Having trouble tuning worries out and turning your brain off? Try journaling or coloring. Both activities have the same effect as meditation.

And turning in at night and waking up in the morning at the same time everyday is one of the big ways you help keep your circadian rhythm running smoothly, Goel explains. Since our circadian rhythms play such a big role in regulating energy levels and metabolism, keeping your sleep schedule regulated is one of the most key things you can do to feel energized and ready to wake up morning after morning, she says.

3. Drink water

Add lemon, ice or cucumber — or just drink it straight up. We get dehydrated overnight (especially if nature calls and you’re using the bathroom in the pre-dawn hours), Goel says. A glass or two of H2O first thing helps replenish your body’s hydration stores. It also starts your metabolism on the right foot (since the body relies on water to keep all your digestive processes running smoothly).

4. Meditate

“Quieting the brain is a time-honored way to be more creative, more contemplative and more in touch with oneself,” Goodwin says. Some people might not necessarily feel an energy boost from meditating, but because it helps us to think more effectively and efficiently, it should make for a much more productive day.

Having trouble tuning worries out and turning your brain off? Try journaling or coloring, Goodwin suggests. Both activities have the same effect as meditation, she says — to calm you down, slow down and focus your thinking and let inspire you to think more creatively.

5. Exercise

Muster the energy to start sweating first thing and it will reward you. Exercise releases endorphins — chemicals produced in the brain that help minimize pain and discomfort and increase wellbeing (essentially the body’s own painkillers). Read: that early jog or spin class is giving your brain a natural high and an energy boost.

Plus, endorphins can reduce stress hormones, too — helping you start your day unfettered and in control.

6. Get outside in the sun

Want to make that early workout work even harder for you? Do it outside in the sun. Getting sunlight first thing in the morning tells your body clock it’s time to start the day, Goel explains.

There’s an entire field of research (chronobiology) that shows light is what triggers the body to stop producing melatonin, the hormone that tells the body to sleep, and be more alert. (And conversely, experts know that not being exposed to enough natural light throughout the day can trigger mood problems like depression and low energy.)

Studies show that using specifically timed bright light therapy (with an artificial bright light) can yield some of the same benefits for your body clock as the sun does, if getting natural light is not an option — particularly for people with mood disorders, circadian rhythm disorders or jet lag. Though it’s worth noting that not all artificial light has the same effect, so ask a doctor to find a safe and effective treatment before you try it.

7. Make coffee (at home)

If a cup of java — or tea — starts your morning on the right foot, have your caffeine in the morning, Goel says. There’s a lot of data to show it really does help most people feel more alert and less groggy, she says. And while a coffee habit can get a bad rap, there’s also a lot of research that shows drinking it (in moderation!) actually has some health benefits, too.

Plus if you brew it at home you’re saving yourself some green, too. Spending even just a couple of dollars five days a week on coffee can set you back more than $500 over the course of a year (or as much as $1,300 for a daily five-dollar latte).

8. Eat breakfast

Food is where your body gets energy — so it makes sense that starting your day with food is one of the most energizing things you can do. Our metabolism works better earlier in the day, Goel explains. That means that the body is better able to turn the calories you eat into energy that you can use in the morning, she says. (Recent research from her team backs this up, showing that eating bigger meals later in the day was linked to more weight gain and higher cholesterol — and actually harmed the way the body breaks down fat.)

And even though there’s some discrepancy in the data, most experts agree skipping your first meal can make you more likely to overeat later in the day, Goel adds.

She suggests eating within about two hours of waking up. “You want to be able to capitalize on those energy stores before you head out the door.” And include some protein, as well healthy carbohydrates (like fruit or whole grains) in you’re a.m.-meal, she adds — and skip the donuts and other sugar-packed foods. “A donut is not going to sustain you as well as eggs,” she says.

9. Spend time with your family and friends

Set up a run date with a friend. Take the time to eat breakfast with your family. Call someone who makes you smile while you’re getting ready or walking to the office. Being with people you like and love can serve up a big boost to our mood and energy levels, Goodwin says. (Just keep in mind that stressful interactions with family and friends do the opposite — and can curtail productivity and your mood quickly, Goodwin adds.)

373,A 30-minute morning routine that will clear your mind and banish stress,"Next five minutes: Mindfulness techniques and deep breathing

Next, implement some mindfulness techniques to clear your mind. This can be in the form of meditation, prayer or affirmations of gratitude.

“I recommend that all my patients engage in some sort of meditation or prayer first thing in the morning,” says Dr. Nicole Bernard Washington, a board certified psychiatrist and the chief medical officer at Elocin Psychiatric Services. “The benefit is to clear your thoughts and allow you to start the day with a clear mind.”

“Gratitude affirmations are a great way to start the day as well,” Washington says. “By starting the day making gratitude statements you allow yourself to focus on the positive things in your life. In a world that tends to highlight the negative, starting your day off on a positive note can have positive effects on your mood.”

You can also incorporate breathing exercises to help achieve clarity.

“While laying in bed, breath in through your nose, hold it for five seconds and then release the air through your mouth,” instructs Dr. Erlanger ‘Earl’ Turner, a licensed clinical psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at the University of Houston-Downtown. “Repeat these steps several times. It should help to relax the mind and body.”

Spend five minutes journaling, which can also be done in bed

The urge to pick up your phone or laptop is probably powerful now, but hold off for just another five minutes and instead take to pen and paper (ideally you should keep a journal on your nightstand).

Christie Tcharkhoutian, M.A., MFT, a licensed marriage and family therapist finds “writing upon waking” to be beneficial.

Writing continues that creative flow from your dream life into your day as opposed to automatically waking up and looking at your phone, which can put a creative block and interfere with your ability to stay present.

“Some brain research suggests that this practice is helpful for brain integration because it helps to integrate parts of the brain that involve linguistic and creative capabilities, setting a tone of creativity and balance for the rest of the day,” she says. “Writing something positive — such as three things you are grateful for or a positive intention for the day — can help to improve mood throughout the day. Our dream life and subconscious work overtime in our sleep and channeling that stream of consciousness as soon as you wake up into writing helps to feel more connected and mindful throughout your day. Writing continues that creative flow from your dream life into your day as opposed to automatically waking up and looking at your phone, reading and consuming information which can put a creative block and interfere with your ability to stay present throughout the day.”

If journaling isn’t your thing, listen to positive messages you recorded

Journaling may be a practice you’re not into, or prefer to do at night. If either is the case, consider making a recording of yourself reading daily affirmations aloud and listen to them instead.

“To implement daily affirmations into your morning and set an intention by reading them aloud to yourself, or listening to a recording of yourself reading them every morning,” says Tcharkhoutian. “If positive statements about your identity are replaying like a broken record, they will combat the negative beliefs that can creep in and sabotage your day.”

Spend 5 minutes writing down the essential tasks for the day

Once you do the aforementioned practices, you can get down to the business of the day — but before your mind starts buzzing with to-dos, use these five minutes to itemize, prioritize and be super specific with what you want to achieve today in list form.

“Don’t just [write] ‘check emails.’ Write down, ‘check 20 emails in 30 minutes from x to x time,” says Stephanie Lincoln, a licensed mental health counselor, certified fitness trainer and the Founder/CEO of Fire Team Whiskey. “We all have hundreds of items on our to-do lists, and this helps us prioritize just five essentials for that day to not feel so overwhelmed.”",0
374,60-second health makeover: 6 simple tips for a better workout,"Did you know that fewer than 5 percent of adults clock in the recommended 30 minutes of physical activity each day? In fact, recent reports project that by the year 2039, half of all adults in the United States will be obese.

And this is certainly the time of year when even those of us who normally work out regularly find it hard to squeeze in fitness (and keep the pounds off). Over the holidays people say they’re much more likely to behave in more sedentary ways like watching TV, sleeping, eating and drinking to manage their stress. And, according to a poll by the American Psychological Association, up to 69 percent of people are stressed by the feeling of having a “lack of time” to get everything done during the holiday season.

If you’re one of those people who feels their blood pressure rise just looking at your to-do list, you may have already decided to shelve any health goals until the new year. But it is possible to begin making positive health changes — and get a jump-start on those resolutions — without having to scrounge for extra time in your schedule.

With so much going on this month, now’s not the time to make sweeping changes to your health routine. But by making some small adjustments you can still feel healthier, which helps to encourage you to make other healthy choices along the way. Plus you’re be working to offset the holiday cheer that is to blame for seasonal weight gain. Whether the holidays leave you pressed for time, or you’re just looking for ways to kick your workout routine up a notch, we’ve got you covered with simple health hacks that only take a minute or less.

Change the grip on your weights to better tone arms

According to the American Council on Exercise, people should consider varying their exercise routines not only to prevent boredom, but also to avoid reaching a plateau in performance and results. If you’ve tried on a holiday dress and noticed your arms are less toned than you’d like, a simple change in grip on your dumbbells can tweak the major muscles involved in each move and expedite your results. For example, if you’re used to doing a bicep curl with your palms holding onto the weights, with the weights parallel to the floor, you can change it up with this quick hack: Turn the dumbbells so that the head of the dumbbell is facing up, so as you curl up, you’ll be practically hitting your shoulder with the head of the weight (and performing a hammer curl). In other words, by holding onto the dumbbells and turning your wrists towards each other (instead of facing up towards the ceiling) you’ll change the angle of the bicep curl and engage different muscles.

This can be done for side extensions, overhead presses, and more arm exercises. For side extensions, simply turn the palms face up instead of face down while holding the dumbbells, and you’ll get a completely different arm workout!

Reverse the order of your workout moves

The scenario is a common one: When you first started your workout routine you saw results that you were happy with. But now, after a few weeks or months, you’re not seeing results even though you’re performing the same moves. Reverse engineering to the rescue! This tactic is another way to avoid plateauing and keep your body guessing without having to develop a whole new training routine.

Simply do your same workout routine backwards. For example, let’s take a mini workout. If you’re used to doing squats, bicep curls, then push-ups, reverse the order! Start with push-ups, then bicep curls, and then end with squats. By making your body guess which moves are coming next, you’re incorporating more interval training and helping to build more muscle.

Squat it out while you’re waiting for your shower to warm up

Instead of standing around for 60 seconds waiting for the water to get warm before you step into the shower, do squats! Even though standing does burn more calories than sitting, strength training and exercise burns even more. And your opportunities to squeeze in one minute of exercise doesn’t stop at the shower —waiting for water to boil on the stove, folding laundry or peeling vegetables all provide the perfect opportunity to drop into a squat, do some leg lifts or even a one-minute plank. Over the course of the day those bursts of activity can add up to a solid workout.

Turn your post-workout stretch into a 60-second meditation

Stress is at an all-time high over the holidays, when busy schedules, end-of-year work deadlines, family dynamics and financial concerns take a toll on our mental health. And meditation is proven to help reduce those sky-high stress levels — and the health risks that come with them. Whether you’re a meditation skeptic or feel like you don’t have the time, turn your post-workout stretch routine into a meditation by simply focusing on your breathing while stretching. Close your eyes during your stretches. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth, slowing down your heart rate and focusing on how your body feels in this calming state.

And an added bonus? Research has shown that people who practice mindfulness experienced significant weight loss. So if that’s one of your fitness goals, becoming more mindful through meditating during your post-workout stretches may help you attain it faster.

Skip gym breaks and add in cardio bursts

Studies show that doing cardio in short, 60-second bursts helps improve cardiovascular fitness and can help in burning fat.

Do you give your body a rest after a set, check your phone or walk over to the water fountain? Instead, add in a one-minute burst of cardio between each weightlifting exercise, whether it be jogging in place, high knees or jumping rope. Studies show that doing cardio in short, 60-second bursts helps improve cardiovascular fitness and can help in burning fat. Plus, you’re squeezing cardio into your existing routine, without having to schedule in extra time at the gym.

Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning

This may just be the easiest change you can make to your daily routine. Of course you should be hydrating before and after a workout, but add an extra glass to your morning routine as well. By simply grabbing a glass of water first thing in morning, you’ll be adding 8-12 ounces to your tally right off the bat and you’ll be starting your day on a healthy note, which can have a ripple effect, prompting a series of healthy choices to follow. Not to mention that research shows that staying hydrated helps with fat and weight loss, and overall health.

According to the Natural Hydration Council, ""dehydration can reduce our ability to concentrate, our cognitive and physical performance, and increase feelings of aggression or irritation"" (which is already at an all-time high thanks to traffic jams, mile-long lines at the mall and having to spend extra quality time with your in-laws). And even mild dehydration can affect our mood and energy levels. So if nothing else, staying hydrated can help keep you energized and calm as you power through your holiday to-do list.

375,Running on empty? Try this daily routine to boost your energy,"American work culture is guilty of driving us to work longer and harder, leaving our energy levels at a lull. In fact, according to a 2015 survey from YouGov, 54 percent of Americans sleep only 6 hours per night and still wake up tired on 4 or more days per week, and 27 percent of Americans manage to get a full 7 to 8 hours a night and still report feeling tired or fatigued four or more days a week.

Why are we so fatigued, even if we’re getting sleep? It’s likely because fatigue and sleepiness aren’t the same thing, says Dr. Matthew Ebben, Ph.D., associate professor of Psychology and Clinical Neurology and sleep expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian, in New York City.

Ebben explains that a temporary lull in energy levels, or a little sleepiness around mid-late afternoon, isn’t really due to fatigue but a dip in your circadian rhythms, or internal body clock, which play a key role in regulating your sleep/wake cycles.

“Your underlying sleep drive changes throughout the day,” Ebben explains. “Most people have a little dip in circadian rhythms mid-afternoon, depending on when they sleep and wake up, usually between 1-4 pm. When you have this dip, you can feel sleepy for a half an hour to an hour.” This mid-afternoon lull is usually when we tend to reach for a cup of coffee, or something sweet, to give our energy levels a boost to get through the rest of the work day.

Is it just the midday slump or something more?

Ebben says the first step to figure out if sleep or fatigue is causing your lack of energy is, quite simply, to get more sleep and see. If you sleep a lot longer past your weekday alarm on weekends, your body might be trying to make up for lost time. “Let’s say your alarm wakes you up every day at 6 am, but you’re sleepy during the day. On the weekends, without an alarm, you sleep until 9. What that tells you is you’re chronically sleep deprived during the week,” he explains.

Fatigue, however, is another story — and the common culprit likely won’t surprise you. “Stress is a common cause of fatigue in that it results in the release of inflammatory molecules that enter the brain and cause the feeling of fatigue,” says Peg Baim, M.S., N.P., director of clinical training at Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital.

A better way to boost your energy levels

Regardless of root cause, how can we best pull through these energy lulls without reaching for coffee and sugary treats? We enlisted the help of a few experts to share energy hacks we busy people can employ when we’re at a low ebb.

1. Get a move on first thing

Studies show that exercise improves cognition and releases endorphins — also known as feel-good hormones—that boost your mood and energy levels, especially after high-intensity workouts. So, if you’re dragging yourself out of bed and need to wake up quick, a few burpees (5-10) will maximize blood flow to your brain and body and help you get alert, says Bo Babenko, DPT, a physical therapist at Halevy Life.

2. Eat breakfast

Though it’s tempting to subsist on coffee until lunchtime, studies show that eating breakfast can slightly boost your brain power. And, as we’ve reported before, having a protein-packed meal first thing can help silence signals in your brain that can lead to sugar cravings later on, trigger signals in your brain that make you feel full.

3. Get up out of your chair

To keep your energy flowing throughout the day, be sure to take movement breaks. “When it comes to fighting fatigue, exercise is key,” says Baim. “Aim for 30 minutes 5 days a week, at least 4 hours before sleep,” she recommends. If you start to feel droopy at your desk, Babenko says these chair press-ups (make sure the chair is sturdy) are his go-to recommendation for office workers who need a quick pick-me-up. Or, if you’re sagging through through a marathon meeting or long client dinner, he recommends sneaking into the restroom to do 10 squats for a quick pick-me-up.

4. Combine protein and carbs for meals and snacks

That 4 o’clock sugar craving may feel like it’s giving you a boost, but the blood sugar crash you’ll feel a few hours afterward will leave you ready for bed right after dinner. To keep your energy levels (and mood) even, snack on a combo of protein and carbs — like yogurt with fruit and nuts or a protein shake with fruits blended in — says Deena Adimoolam, assistant professor of Medicine, Endocrinology, Diabetes and Bone Disease at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.

5. Mellow out in the evening

As Baim mentioned above, stress is a common cause of fatigue. So how can we best de-stress when we don’t have 90 minutes for a yoga class? “Positive thoughts buffer stress, so keep your brain out of trouble 2-3 hours pre-sleep,” she recommends. “All negative thoughts turn on the brain’s stress response and will make it harder to get high quality sleep, or to fall and stay asleep. Instead of worrying, focus on positive thoughts, such as positive expectations and appreciations.” She also recommends meditation as a way to counter stress and lead the brain into the same EEG pattern as the first stage of sleep, so you can ease yourself into bed time and catch the z’s you so desperately need. These apps and expert Zen hacks can help you get started.

6. Get to bed on time — consistently

“Our culture works against sleep so most don’t realize how essential sleep is to overall mood, energy, stress tolerance, metabolism and even appetite drives,” says Baim. Ebben also says getting enough sleep usually helps boost alertness the next day. But aside from what you might read, sleep solutions aren’t one-size-fits-all. “You’d never go into a shoe store and ask for the national average sized shoe,” says Ebben. “Like any biological system, you, as an individual, have to figure out how much sleep you need.”

To get more sleep during the week, Ebben recommends slowly dialing back your bed time by 15 minutes, every five days or so. If you find yourself staring at the ceiling instead of passing out, you might be in bed too early. Once you find your sweet spot, stick to it consistently to maintain your sleep quality — sleeping in on weekends can cause you to stay up past your bedtime, making it that much harder to adjust come Monday morning — and to do those burpees.

376,The Strange Morning Routine That Helps a Broadway Star Face Her Fears,"After decades of opening and closing nights, Rachel Bay Jones, the stage actress and singer who was cast as Heidi Hansen, the loving, but struggling single mother in the Broadway hit ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" has finally reached career nirvana. The Hollywood Reporter's chief critic called Bay Jones ""the show's secret weapon."" Last night, she won the Tony Award for best actress in a musical.

Born to two stage actors in Florida, Rachel dropped out of high school and spent years honing her craft in theaters all over the country — from Hawaii to North Carolina to the Great White Way. Speaking of her three-decade career, Bay Jones told The Hollywood Reporter, ""I really believe we're always getting ready. Everyone's go-time is different.""

NBC News BETTER caught up with Jones in her dressing room just moments before curtain call to find what keeps her fearless and inspired in her Broadway home away from home.

Every time I brush my teeth, I look to my good friend, Mr. Shark. And it kinda reminds me to just get in the water, face your fear and do it anyway.

What inspired you to become an actor?

Both of my parents were stage actors so my inspiration came from seeing their fearlessness on stage and their passion for theater.

What's your morning routine like?

Before I get up I think about any dreams I had — or anything that requires creativity or difficult thought. That middle place between sleeping and waking is the best for knowing what you really want.

Then, coffee! I try to make my bed. And I keep my phone on silent for a little while so I can get my bearings before the world calls me away from myself.

I'm really scared of sharks. I grew up in Florida and swam a lot in the ocean. And that was, and is, probably my biggest fear. So sometimes it's pretty scary going out on stage. And since my dressing room is my office, and also my bathroom, and my morning routine, every time I brush my teeth, I look to my good friend, Mr. Shark — Mr. Great White Terrifying Shark. And we brush our teeth together. And it kinda reminds me to just get in the water, face your fear and do it anyway.

When you did really feel like you ""made it?""

Ummm... (Editor's note: She won a Tony Award!)

That middle place between sleeping and waking is the best for knowing what you really want.

What's on your nightstand right now?

A long dead Kindle because I like paper best. I have a hardcover signed first edition of Moonglow by Michael Chabon — I love him and I love this book. A tiny antique bell. Three pairs of scuffed reading glasses. And layers of tangled necklaces hanging from a hundred and fifty year old clock. I have a big nightstand!

377,"8 super simple, super satisfying summer pastas","Pasta’s ease and versatility make it a weeknight dinner wonder. Boil some noodles, toss in whatever you have on hand, and you can have a satisfying, stress-free supper on the table in no time. Plus, pasta is a crowd-pleaser — have you ever heard anyone say they don’t like pasta?

In summer, when the market is filled with peak-season produce, pasta can really shine. It’s the perfect base for showcasing ripe, fresh vegetables, including zucchini, yellow squash, baby greens and perhaps best of all, tomatoes. The options are almost limitless, but to help you enjoy a summer of seasonal, veggie-focused pastas, we looked to chefs and food pros for inspiration. With recipes from Elizabeth Minchilli, Andrew Zimmern, Kelly Senyei, Giada De Laurentiis, Kevin Curry, Sara Lynn Cauchon and Abra Berens, you’ll find yourself stocking up on extra boxes of spaghetti, gemelli and penne, so you can enjoy a summer pasta any night of the week.

Pasta with Smashed Tomatoes and Arugula Elizabeth Minchilli

This simple pasta, from Elizabeth Minchilli’s ""Italian Table: Creating Festive Meals for Family and Friends"" is perfect for summer, because it takes advantage of tomatoes at the height of their season, says the author and Italian food expert. “Although it requires some cooking, it’s fast and you’re not stuck in a hot kitchen for too long,” says Minchilli. With so few ingredients, it’s essential that you start with the best. Tomatoes should taste like tomatoes and be ripe and thin-skinned, but if yours are hard to bite into, cutting them in half before cooking will help. “Ricotta salata is a briny, salty, somewhat crumbly cheese,” explains Minchilli. “Crumbled feta is a great alternative.”

Gemelli With Kale Pesto And Olives Food Network

“Baby greens are all over farmers’ markets during the summer months,” says TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis, who combines baby kale with walnuts, orange zest and juice, and Parmigiano Reggiano for an unexpected pesto to toss with spiral-shaped gemelli pasta. “Feel free to make a swap for the baby kale, depending on what is available,” says De Laurentiis. “Baby swiss chard, mustard greens and even baby arugula would be great here.” The pasta and pesto are tossed with rotisserie chicken to make this dish more substantial, plus two kinds of olives really bump up the flavor.

Spaghetti With Zucchini And Squash Melissa Libertelli for Food Network

“Who doesn’t have way too much squash in the summer?” asks De Laurentiis. This colorful pasta, featuring both green zucchini and yellow squash, will be your new warm weather go-to. Arugula adds extra veggies to the mix, while lemon zest and juice make for a brighter, livelier dish. Best of all, this pasta is good for parties and picnics. “The squash acts as a buffer to stop the pasta from sticking to itself, so it is just as good at room temperature as it is hot, explains De Laurentiis.

Spinach Artichoke Dip Pasta With Chicken Kelly Senyei

“Ditch the chips and grab your pasta of choice,” says Just a Taste blogger Kelly Senyei. Her veggie-packed pasta transforms classic, irresistible spinach and artichoke dip into an “easy, cheesy meal-in-a-bowl.” Plus, it’s made with two full pounds of spinach, so you can indulge without the guilt. Artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, diced chicken and a garlicky cream sauce make it a complete supper. Best of all, the recipe makes 12 servings and leftovers “reheat like a breeze,” says Senyei.

Broccoli Rabe Pasta With Lemony Breadcrumbs Madeleine Hill

Andrew Zimmern, the four-time James Beard Award–winning TV personality, chef, executive producer and host of Travel Channel's ""Bizarre Foods"", loves the fresh summer flavors and versatility of this dish. Though pasta isn’t typically associated with grilling, Zimmern grills broccoli rabe before tossing it with spaghetti and lemon- and garlic-infused breadcrumbs to create a supper that sits squarely in summer. “Bitter and vegetal green flavors, accentuated by the char, are perfect foils for something acidic like lemon,” explains Zimmern. “The pasta, which acts as a flat canvas, marries all those BIG flavors.” As a bonus, this dish is surprisingly good cold, so save the leftovers to enjoy for lunch.

Beet-Dressed Pasta With Golden Raisins And Poppy Seeds EE Berger

This eye-catching, purple-hued pasta, from Abra Berens’ new cookbook, ""Ruffage: A Practical Guide to Vegetables,"" gets its gorgeous color from puréed beets. “I love the texture of this dish,” says Berens. “The pasta has a delicate chew coated with a slick of the beet purée, the raisins provide a juicy pop, and the poppy seeds a tiny little crunch.” It’s also an unexpected way to enjoy nutrient-packed beets. If you don’t have time to steam-roast the beets, Berens says it’s fine to use the packaged cooked beets available at supermarkets. Simply warm them with a splash of water in the microwave for easy blending.

Healthy Shrimp & Veggie Pasta FitMenCook / FitMenCook

“One skillet and 10 minutes is all you need to make the most delicious shrimp and veggie pasta you’ve ever had,” insists fitness influencer and ""Fit Men Cook"" author Kevin Curry. The secret is swapping traditional wheat pasta for zucchini and carrot noodles, which make for a lighter, more colorful dish that packs in both fiber and protein. Curry’s trick for the ultimate veggie noodles is to toss them with a little salt and set them in a colander to draw out moisture. You’ll also want to seek out colorful carrots, so your pasta looks as good as Curry’s.

One Pot Pesto Penne With Spinach And Peas The Domestic Geek

“One pot pasta is a total game changer when it comes to weeknight cooking,” says

Sara Lynn Cauchon, the YouTube star known as The Domestic Geek and author of the cookbook, ""The Domestic Geek’s Meals Made Easy: A Fresh, Fuss-Free Approach to Healthy Cooking"". “The idea is simple: Instead of cooking your pasta and sauce in two separate pots, they’re cooked together using broth.” The pasta absorbs the liquid, making for a more flavorful meal but also less dishes. “What’s not to love?” asks Cauchon. Add in spinach and peas and you have a very veggie-focused dinner.",0
378,Need a healthy snack idea? Try these crispy air fried herbed chickpeas,"In my opinion, “crispy chickpeas” never lived up to their promise, and were a constant disappointment when I made them whether they were deep-fried or roasted in the oven. They often came out too soggy and chewy, rather than truly crispy. So I set out to see if the air fryer did a better job. And I can confidently say, it does the best job I’ve ever witnessed of making actually crisp chickpeas. The high heat, circulating at a super-fast speed, dries out the chickpeas so they’re almost dehydrated. Be careful, or you’ll start eating these and wake up 5 minutes later to an empty bowl.

1 can (15 ounces) chickpeas, rinsed and dried with paper towels

1 tablespoon olive oil

½ teaspoon dried rosemary

½ teaspoon dried parsley

½ teaspoon dried chives

¼ teaspoon mustard powder

¼ teaspoon sweet paprika

¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

In a large bowl, combine all the ingredients except the kosher salt and black pepper and toss until the chickpeas are evenly coated in the herbs and spices. Scrape the chickpeas and seasonings into the air fryer and cook at 350°F until browned and crisp, 6 to 12 minutes, shaking the basket halfway through. Transfer the crispy chickpeas to a bowl, sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper, and serve warm.

Note: During testing, I found that different brands of canned chickpeas “fry” up at wildly different rates. Some brands only took 6 minutes to get crisp, while other brands, where the chickpeas were comparatively larger in size and meatier, took almost double that. Hence, the range in cooking time for this recipe. Start out with your favorite go-to brand and cook them for 6 minutes. If they’re not crisp enough after that, continue cooking in 2-minute intervals until they are. Then you’ll know the correct amount of time for that specific brand.

379,8 chefs share their favorite burger recipes for summer,"With summer and warm weather comes an appetite for grilled food — especially burgers. Sure, you can eat burgers year-round, but there’s nothing quite like a juicy patty hot off the grill, especially if you can enjoy it in your own backyard. Plus, when you’re flipping burgers at home, you’re in control. You get to pick the best ingredients and create different combinations to suit your palate or just what you happen to be craving. And the options are just about limitless. In addition to the classic American beef and cheese on a bun combo, you can make burgers with different meat, poultry, or seafood, sandwich them between all kinds of bread and rolls, and go crazy with toppings.

To kick off a summer we hope is filled with burgers and backyard time, we’ve gathered recipes and advice from chefs and food experts, including Andrew Zimmern, Giada De Laurentiis, Adam Richman, Serena Wolf, Martha Stewart and Jamie Purviance. From beef to salmon to turkey and from classic to creative, these pros have you covered, so fire up those coals and get ready for some serious burger bliss.

Banh Mi Burger Evan Sung

As the star of ""Man vs. Food"" and ""Adam Richman’s The Best Sandwich in America"" on Discovery, Adam Richman knows a thing or two about sandwiches and travel-inspired eating. This pork burger, adapted from his cookbook, ""Straight Up Tasty; Meals, Memories and Mouthfuls from My Travels,"" blends two of Richman’s favorites, the classic American burger and the Vietnamese banh mi. The result showcases “their best attributes” and is “creamy, crunchy, sour and juicy,” says Richman. Pork pâté is easy to find in upscale supermarkets or online, but if you can’t find it — or just don’t like it — Richman insists this burger has so much big flavor, you can skip it.

Giadzy

“Nothing says summer like ripe tomatoes in a caprese salad or a burger right off the grill, so why not have the best of both worlds?” asks TV personality, cookbook author and restaurateur Giada DeLaurentiis. Adding pesto—homemade or store-bought—and Parmesan to ground sirloin beef makes for juicy, flavor-packed burgers that get an extra boost from a bright and couldn’t-be-easier-to-make pesto mayonnaise, plus fresh tomato slices and creamy mozzarella. Serving the patties on lightly grilled focaccia emphasizes the Italian theme, but regular hamburger buns also work. You really can’t go wrong. As DeLaurentiis says, “These burgers are always a crowd pleaser.”

Grilled Turkey Kofta Burgers With Harissa Yogurt Sauce Serena Wolf / Serena Wolf

“Turkey burgers get a bad rap for being dry and tasteless,” explains Serena Wolf, the blogger behind Domesticate Me and author of ""The Dude Diet: Clean(ish) Food for People Who Like to Eat Dirty"" and the upcoming “The Dude Diet Dinnertime: 125 Clean(ish) Recipes for Weeknight Winners and Fancypants Dinners. But, as a fan of turkey burgers, Wolf has several tricks up her sleeve. “I always recommend using 93% lean ground turkey,” says Wolf. “That little bit of extra fat goes a long way.” It’s also helps to flavor turkey burgers more generously than traditional beef versions, adds Wolf, who uses onion, garlic, fresh parsley and mint, cumin, coriander, cinnamon and cayenne pepper to bump up these Middle Eastern-inspired patties. A little crumbled feta adds additional flavor AND a little fat to keep the burgers “extra juicy and tender.”

Shrimp and Cod Burgers Martha Stewart

“Sweet shrimp and fish ground together form a uniquely rich, juicy burger,” says cooking and entertaining expert Martha Stewart. “This recipe blends the perfect amount of scallion, parsley and lemon juice to hone and polish this burger’s seafood flavor.” Be sure to plan ahead so there’s time for the patties to chill in the fridge before you grill them—they can even be made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight. The Tarragon Tartar Sauce is optional but makes a great condiment and takes minutes to whip up.

Green Chile Turkey Burgers Bryan Gardner

Like turkey burgers, chicken burgers benefit from a little extra seasoning. Stewart’s solution is to add canned green chiles and fresh cilantro, which give these lean burgers “tons of flavor.” Tomato slices are a burger standard, but Stewart steps up the game by grilling them until charred. And in lieu of cheese, she opts for a different kind of dairy: “I love the sour cream that adds a little extra creaminess at the end.”

Mexican Pork Burgers with Tomatillo-Avocado Salsa Madeleine Hill

TV personality, chef and restaurateur Andrew Zimmern prefers to put a South of the Border spin on his pork burgers. “In this recipe, I infuse ground pork with bold Mexican flavors to create an irresistible burger,” he explains. “For the best results, it’s essential that you allow the pork to sit overnight with all of the seasonings to develop complex flavor.” Those seasonings include onion, garlic, and jalapenos, plus oregano, chile powder, cilantro, and chipotle chiles in adobo. Zimmern’s burger is topped with a quick tomatillo-avocado salsa that’s the perfect complement to the rich patty, plus a thin slice of tomato and melty cheddar cheese.

Salmon Burgers with Roasted Tomatoes and Avocado Madeleine Hill

Unlike his heavily seasoned pork burgers, when it comes to salmon burgers, Zimmern takes a less is more approach. “This simple recipe allows the flavor of the salmon to shine,” he explains. With fewer ingredients, quality is extra important. “I prefer to use fresh salmon, as opposed to canned salmon,” says Zimmern. “The extra effort and cost is worth it for a better tasting burger with a superior texture.” On top, Zimmern adds oven-roasted tomatoes, which he recommends keeping on hand, especially during the summer tomato season—plus avocado slices and greens dressed with a squeeze of lemon. “For a healthier alternative, you can skip the bun and serve the salmon patty on top of a salad.”

Classic American Cheeseburger Ray Kachatorian

If you ever doubted the deliciousness of a classic burger, think again. “These cheeseburgers are exceedingly rich and gratifying,” says grilling expert Jamie Purviance. “The tender meat produces beefy juices that run down your chin, and the flavor of the charred surfaces is enough to stun you into silence.” Purviance, who included this recipe in his latest cookbook, ""Weber’s Ultimate Grilling: A Step-by-Step Guide to Barbecue Genius,"" recommends seeking out ground meat that’s from a particular cut of beef, such as chuck or roast, and 20 percent fat. When it comes to shaping the patties, aim to create loose, round balls then gently flatten them until about 1-inch thick, says Purviance. If you press a little dimple into the center of each patty, that will keep the burgers from puffing up in the center, so you have a flatter surface for all your favorite toppings.

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY .

A long winter and spring stuck inside in the dry air may have made the skin on your feet, especially your heels, super dry — dry enough to crack like a fault line. And while COVID-related self-isolation may tempt you to keep your feet hidden, cracks in your heels can fracture into deep cuts, or fissures, that can be pretty painful and even get infected. We asked board certified dermatologists Sheel Desai Solomon, MD, founder of Preston Dermatology & Skin Surgery in North Carolina and Samer Jaber, MD, founder of Washington Square Dermatology in New York City, what causes dry, cracked heels and the best treatment for dry heels.

IN THIS ARTICLE What causes dry, cracked heels | How to care for dry, cracked heels | Treating dry or cracked heels | What if over-the-counter treatments don't work?

What causes dry, cracked heels

“Cracked heels occur when you have a disruption of your skin barrier,” explains Jaber. “It can be from a medical condition, like psoriasis or eczema, or can occur when your skin is very dry.”

Other variables that can dry skin on heels enough to crack are age (your skin gets thinner, less elastic and some common medications can contribute) and, of course, winter can be quite the culprit. “Heels are at their worst in winter,” says Solomon. “Indoors and outdoors there is less humidity in the air, and a lack of humidity causes the skin to become drier. Drier skin means more cracking and peeling.” This kind of cracking can cause wounds that can easily get infected if not treated, and if you happen to have a compromised immune system or diabetes, an infection can become a serious health risk, Solomon says.

How to care for dry, cracked heels

1. Keep your feet clean and moisturized

Solomon says diligence in keeping your feet clean and moisturized will keep you on the good foot. “Wash feet with non-foaming hydrating cleanser (typically in a cream or milk form) to keep foot skin from drying further and moisturize still-damp feet after every bath or shower,” she recommends. “That's when it’s time to apply products with petrolatum, glycerin, shea butter, vitamin E or jojoba. These ingredients are very effective at preventing moisture loss.” She also recommends a kitchen cabinet remedy to try — honey. “Honey is full of antimicrobial and antibacterial properties great for cleansing and healing wounds, particularly Manuka honey,” she says, saying you can create your own honey foot mask by combining it with a drop of almond oil and slathering it on your heels.

2. Slough off dead skin

To prevent cracks, exfoliation is key. Both experts extol the virtues of moisturizers with exfoliants like urea (not urine, but a similar compound that has been shown to help moisture seep into skin), and salicylic acid, to help prevent heel cracks with regular use. Solomon also recommends using a “safe foot file that doesn’t look like a cheese grater” to remove dead skin. “Using a foot file on your feet after a shower or bath can be a great way to avoid thick calluses or cracks,” she says. “However, if the file has sharp teeth, it is putting you at risk for cuts or scrapes. The goal is to remove the old, dead skin but leave the healthy layer intact to protect [against] infection.”

3. Seal up deep cracks

Cracked heels that have reached the point where they’ve started to bleed can be extremely painful, warns Solomon. Both experts say liquid bandages are an extremely effective way of sealing up cracks to ease the pain of walking on torn skin while keeping the wounds clean.

4. Wear socks made of natural materials

The damp, dark environment of wet socks in shoes and boots can bring on a fungal foot infection that resembles dry skin, warns Solomon. To prevent this from happening, she advises choosing winter socks made from natural materials, such as cotton or wool rather than synthetic blends, to keep your feet sweat and bacteria-free. “Materials like cotton and wool are naturally more absorbent and these moisture-wicking qualities are extremely important during the winter months. An added bonus is that your feet are less likely to smell, too,” she says. Jaber says his trick to beat cracks in severe dry and cold weather is to advise his patients to apply Vaseline onto the heels of their feet before bed and immediately put on white cotton socks to lock in the moisturizer while they sleep.

Treating dry or cracked heels

Jaber recommends applying this spot treatment to your heels because its formula contains a high percentage of urea and exfoliating alpha hydroxy acid, which are great at removing dead skin cells so the moisturizing components of the formula, like sunflower oil rich in vitamins A and E, can seep in to heal skin.

Dermatologists love this non-comedogenic, lanolin-free formula, because it doesn’t irritate the skin. As it’s almost half petrolatum (qualifying it as an ointment), is enriched with ceramides (to restore your skin’s barrier) and it also contains hyaluronic acid, an ingredient that helps skin retain moisture.

Jabar favors this multitasking moisturizer for its bounty of skin-loving ingredients. Lactic, salicylic and hyaluronic acids exfoliate and moisturize; niacinamide, a B vitamin, helps prevent moisture loss; and ceramides 1, 3, and 6-II help restore your skin’s protective barrier. The formula is free of fragrances and dyes and it releases over time to keep your skin super soft.

Solomon recommends these socks because they have a liner that uses aloe vera, vitamin E, and shea butter to intensely hydrate your skin, she says. Plus, they are infused with medical-grade mineral oil for an added boost of moisture.

What if over-the-counter treatments don't work?

Both dermatologists say that if the cracks keep up despite proper, frequent application of high-quality over-the-counter products like these, it might be time to have your dermatologist take a peek. “Lack of vitamins, minerals and zinc in your diet can adversely affect your heel health,” Solomon says. “Sometimes there can be a fungus. If it’s just dry skin, dermatologists can prescribe emollients, such as ammonium lactate or urea cream, to get your skin healthy, then switch to a lotion for maintaining that health.”

But the most important thing is to try and determine the cause of the cracking, says Jaber. “If it’s more related to dryness, try and avoid harsh soaps and detergents and maybe, if it’s really dry, get a humidifier. It’s always better to prevent something than to treat it.”

381,"Best anti-aging creams, serums and more, according to experts","To create an effective anti-aging routine, Shah suggests practicing healthy skin care habits. This starts with using a broad-spectrum sunscreen moisturizer with an SPF of 30 on exposed skin year-round.

“Preventing wrinkle formation can also be achieved by the reduction of inflammation through antioxidants which should be used in combination with sunscreens and retinoids to enhance their protective effect,” Shah adds. So look for a serum with antioxidant ingredients: vitamin C and green tea extract are two of Shah’s favorites. Says Marnie Nussbaum, MD, dermatologist in New York City, “Vitamin C is my go to as a potent antioxidant ingredient. It works very well in combination with vitamin E and ferulic acid to protect against free radical damage which can cause skin cancers and collagen breakdown leading to fine lines.”

Speaking of retinoids (a derivative of vitamin A), it’s pretty much the gold standard when it comes to anti-aging ingredients. “Retinoids or retinol has been studied for anti-aging and has been shown to help promote skin turnover, which brings new skin cells to the surface and promotes collagen production, preventing the formation of fine lines and wrinkles,” says Marisa Garshick, MD, dermatologist at MDCS: Medical Dermatology & Cosmetic Surgery in New York City.

Another good ingredient to look for in anti-aging products: hyaluronic acid, “which is a natural sugar molecule that occurs in our body and helps to attract water, so it functions as a great moisturizer,” says Garshick. “It keeps the skin looking fresh and hydrated.” And don’t forget about glycolic acid: It exfoliates skin to help with skin texture and pore size, says Melanie Kingsley, MD, dermatologist at IU Health.

Also pay attention to your eyes. “The skin around your eyes is thin and vulnerable,” Shah says. “Choose an eye-specific product to ensure that you're using a formula designed to minimize any skin reactions in this area, whether you prefer peptides or retinol.” (According to Shah, peptides aid in wound healing and minimizing the look of wrinkles.)

Below, top dermatologists share their favorite anti-aging products for a more youthful look.

The best sunscreens and moisturizers to help promote healthy skin

Dermatologists swear by EltaMD for its cosmetically elegant sunscreen formulas (no white cast here!) that contain added anti-aging ingredients. This one earns particular raves. “It’s moisturizing and it protects my skin from dark spots, wrinkles and skin cancer,” says Shah. “It also contains niacinamide, hyaluronic acid and lactic acid — ingredients that promote the appearance of healthy-looking skin.”

Guanche is a fan of this anti-aging serum because it “provides immediate skin tightening, as well as long term anti-aging results, so you get immediate gratification as well as long term help.” She adds that this serum makes a nice primer under makeup, meaning you won’t have to worry about your foundation balling up.

This serum packs a one-two punch, thanks to the retinol and hyaluronic acid in its formula. “This retinoid serum visibly fills and reduces wrinkles, giving skin a smoother and more plumped appearance,” says Howard D. Sobel, MD, New York City dermatologist and founder of Sobel Skin.

Sometimes a skin care product is worth the splurge, and this is one that continually makes the list of most beloved anti-aging products by top dermatologists. “It has the power of two anti-aging serums packed into one pump,” says Libby Rhee, DO, dermatologist in New York City. One side contains a growth factor serum that restores plumpness and diminishes fine lines, while the other side features a serum chock full of antioxidants to even skin tone and smooth skin texture. “You get all that with one pump, which is helpful when you’re busy or you have a multi-step skin care routine,” says Rhee.

Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, dermatologist in Los Angeles, likes this multi-purpose serum because it contains a number of anti-aging ingredients to target different signs of aging. Hyaluronic acid draws hydration into the top layers of skin for a temporary plumping effect; ferulic acid helps undo UV and pollution-related free radical damage; alpha hydroxy acids gently exfoliate dull dead skin cells that can settle into fine lines; and retinol stimulates new collagen growth.

Nussbaum recommends a vitamin C serum in the morning, because it offers potent antioxidant protection against free radical molecules that damage skin. It also brightens. She likes this one, which combines vitamin C, E, and ferulic acid to rejuvenate skin and prevent new damage.

You don’t always have to shell out major dough to reap anti-aging benefits. Shainhouse sings the praises of this drugstore staple: “It has the efficacy promised by expensive, beauty-counter products,” she says. That’s thanks to the potent ingredients in its formula, including hyaluronic acid to plump skin, niacinamide to soothe redness, dimethicone to lock in hydration, and peptide fragments to prompt skin to produce new collagen over time.

Consider this another reason to hit up your local drugstore. “This budget-friendly night treatment contains both alpha hydroxy acids, which help to unstick and exfoliate dulling, dead skin cells immediately, as well as retinol, which stimulates cell turnover and new collagen production over time,” says Shainhouse. “Together, these help to reduce the appearance of fine lines with regular use over two to three months.”

“Uneven and dull skin tone can actually give a more aging impression that fine lines and wrinkles,” points out Shainhouse. Enter this dark spot corrector, which relies on lightening ingredients like turmeric, birch bark and rice bran extract to fade the appearance of hyperpigmentation.

The delicate skin around your eyes deserves special care. “This anti-aging eye cream with retinol visibly reduces the appearance of crow’s feet wrinkles and the look of dark circles,” Sobel says.

Talk about a triple threat: This 3-in-1 eye product is Adigun’s go-to eye treatment because it acts as an eye cream, concealer and sunscreen. “It’s infused with hyaluronic acid and peptides to help reduce the appearance of fine lines,” she says. “The peach tint covers dark circles beautifully, and there’s an SPF 30 to protect the delicate eye area from sun damage.

Across the country, business are slowly reopening after months of closures in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic. Whether you're venturing out more than before and spending time in the sun or keeping to your home and dealing with warming temperatures, your skin care hasn't lost its importance. If your skin looks as shiny as a disco ball come lunchtime, then congratulations: You have oily skin. Now, don’t get us wrong, some oil in your skin is good.

IN THIS ARTICLE A skincare routine that will control oil production | Best skincare products for oily skin

“When the oil on the skin is the right amount, it protects our skin from external toxic elements,” says Yoram Harth, MD, a dermatologist and medical director of MDacne. “That said, having too much of it makes our skin shiny, can clog our skin pores and causes acne breakouts.”

So what causes oily skin in the first place? Common culprits include genetics, a humid environment, hormonal changes, medications that affect your hormones and sugary and fatty foods, says Viseslav Tonkovic-Capin, MD, a Kansas City dermatologist and editor of DermBoard.org.

The good news is, it is possible to get oily skin under control, and it starts with finding the right skincare products. “In order to balance the oiliness of their skin, people with oily skin need to look for products that will remove excess oil from their skin without over-drying,” Harth says.

A skincare routine that will control oil production

Products should be non-comedogenic, meaning they don’t clog pores, and oil-free, says Melanie Palm, MD, a dermatologist in San Diego. Look for labels that have active ingredients that help your oil glands function more normally, like sulfur, retinol and salicylic acid, suggests Palm. “Lighter formulations are likely to be tolerated better,” she adds. “These include serums, gels or lotions rather than creams or ointments.”

When it comes to cleansing, being gentle is key. So is keeping exfoliating to a minimum (once or twice a week tops), says Lisa Pruett, MD, a dermatologist in Carrollton, Texas. That’s because over-cleansing and scrubbing too harshly can lead to increased oil production, Pruett explains. Using a clay mask twice a week will help control excess oil, adds Hadley King, MD, a dermatologist in New York City. Moisturizing daily is important (no matter how counter-intuitive that sounds if you have oily skin), and so is wearing sunscreen, says Pruett.

Ready to upgrade your skin care routine? Below, dermatologists share their favorite skincare products to help those with oily skin keep their complexion clear and shine-free.

The best skincare products for oily skin

Kenneth Mark, MD, a dermatologist and Moh’s skin cancer surgeon in New York City, likes this facial cleanser, which contains 2 percent salicylic acid to unclog pores and prevent future blackheads. The oil-free formula deeply cleanses without over-stripping skin, so your face will never feel tight or dry.

This cleanser is a favorite of Joshua Zeichner, MD, a dermatologist in New York City, because it’s non-comedogenic and utilizes salicylic acid to treat existing breakouts and fight new ones. This cleanser also contains soy to help even out the look of your skin tone.

“This cleanser has a great combination of glycolic and salicylic acids that can help to remove excess oil,” says Palm. Jojoba oil ensures skin will feel soft and smooth post-cleansing.

This drugstore cleanser is a go-to of Shari Sperling, DO, a dermatologist in Florham Park, New Jersey. The non-comedogenic formula lightly foams to remove excess oil without over-stripping skin.

Plam suggests using this sonic cleansing brush once a day to make cleansing more effective. The brush is gentle enough that even sensitive skin types can use it, yet powerful enough that it removes makeup. It’s also waterproof, so you can use it in the shower.

Toning can help get rid of any excess oil that wasn’t removed from cleansing. “This toner includes witch hazel to remove excess sebum as well as glycolic acid to chemically exfoliate the surface of the skin and aloe vera to soothe and hydrate with its anti-inflammatory and humectant properties,” says King.

Palm likes this face mask because it draws out impurities and controls oil, thanks to the 6.4 percent sulfur in the formula. This oil-free mask also minimizes the appearance of pores.

Sperling likes this clay-based mask for oily skin. Formulated with salicylic acid in addition to clay, this mask works in five minutes to deeply clean and unclog pores without irritation.

“This can be used as either a face mask or a cleanser,” says King, “and either way, the kaolin clay absorbs oils and reduces shine.” It also features a mild amount of salicylic acid to gently exfoliate and remove excess oil and vitamin E for antioxidant protection.

This non-comedogenic and oil-free moisturizer is a great pick for oily skin, says Sperling. It has a matte finish, so you don’t have to worry about looking shiny, and it contains SPF 30 for that much-needed sun protection.

One of the most beloved sunscreens of dermatologists, Pruett notes that it can double as a moisturizer. Palm likes this one because it’s non-comedogenic and free of heavy ingredients. “The zinc oxide and niacinamide in the formula are anti-inflammatory and do not promote oil production,” says Palm.

If you have oily skin, chances are you’ve skipped sunscreen at some point because it can make your skin even shinier. Susan Bard, MD, a dermatologist in New York City, says this one is great for people with oily skin or those who get shiny when they use sunscreen. It’s formulated with tapioca starch to absorb excess oil.

“This is a product that photographers and makeup artists have used for years to combat oily skin on set,” Pruett notes. “The product absorbs facial oils, acting like a leave-on blotting paper throughout the day.”

383,4 make-ahead batch cocktail recipes for spring and summer parties,"In college I was a beer drinker, reaching for inexpensive Rolling Rocks. More recently, I’ve discovered the small-production wines from vineyards near my home in Pennsylvania’s Lehigh Valley. But last October when I visited the Jameson Distillery in Dublin, I tried a Tamarind Sour, and fell in love with cocktails.

Since then, I’ve been squeezing fresh lemons for juice, making my own honey syrup, and tackling classics like the Whiskey Sour and the Old Fashioned. And I’ve discovered that it’s easy enough to craft a cocktail or two with my husband on a weekend. But add just a couple more people, and all that measuring, mixing and shaking can get to be a lot of work.

The solution? Batch cocktails. Maggie Hoffman’s book, ""Batch Cocktails: Make-Ahead Pitcher Drinks for Every Occasion"" features 65 eight-to-10 serving cocktail recipes — including seven nonalcoholic versions — that can be prepared mostly in advance.

“When you’re inviting people over and gathering together for a meal, barbecue or picnic, what you really want to do is spend time with friends and family,” Hoffman says. “If you’re muddling, putting drinks in a cocktail shaker, shaking and straining, you’re missing out on the hanging-out-with-people part.”

Ready to give it a go? Here are four of Hoffman’s top choices for warm-weather entertaining.

Grab a big thermos and take the celery-based Infinity Pool along on hot summer days, Hoffman says. “It’s almost like a celery margarita. The mezcal is so earthy and smoky, and the celery juice and lemon juice are so refreshing. It’s perfect for summer,” she says.

Kelly Puleio © 2019

Hoffman pairs America’s pastime with Riled and Wrangled, a spicy shandy that has little in common with the beer-and-lemonade variety. You can make this batch cocktail with kolsh or pilsner, which gives you the option to serve up a cooler full of bottles or cans on the side for your beer-purist guests.

Kelly Puleio © 2019

For a backyard brunch or engagement party, Hoffman recommends Birds Again. “It’s lovely — light in alcohol and super quick to make. The fresh basil gives it a bright spring flavor that is a real favorite. It’s definitely good for daytime,” Hoffman says. Up your entertaining game by adding the optional edible rosebuds or rose petals.

Kelly Puleio © 2019

Hoffman suggests serving at least one non-alcoholic cocktail when you entertain. “Everybody deserves something special,” Hoffman says. Her go-to choice? The grapefruit-and-honey-based Blaylock. “It sounds simple but it’s magically complex tasting. It’s somehow rich, really good, and so easy to make,” she says.

TIPS FOR A WINNING COCKTAIL ANYTIME

Hoffman’s recipes will step you through the prep and serving, and she also offers these tips if you’re new to batch cocktails:

Measure your container before you start batching. You don’t want to run out of room and discover you still need to add an ounce of lime juice and ice.

You don’t want to run out of room and discover you still need to add an ounce of lime juice and ice. The first time you use a punch bowl fill it with water to test for cracks, especially if you found it at a flea market or yard sale. “I’ve been at a party where there’s been a crack, and it’s all over the table,” Hoffman says.

especially if you found it at a flea market or yard sale. “I’ve been at a party where there’s been a crack, and it’s all over the table,” Hoffman says. Choose quality ingredients. Punches get a bad rap, but that partly comes from people making compromises when they make big batches. Hoffman points out that you can find fresh juice at juice bars and many grocery stores if you don’t have the time to make your own.

If you hold it over the pitcher or punch bowl and overpour you could have an extra tablespoon or more in your drink. Taste test, and trust your taste buds. Ingredients aren’t always exactly the same. Your sparkling wine might be sweeter than the one Hoffman used when creating her recipe. Some grapefruits are more sour while others are sweeter. Spice levels might need adjusting.

Bonus tip: If you’re hooked on batch cocktails you can age these drinks in your fridge, like wine. “I’ve been opening some that are a year old and they’re so good,” Hoffman says. “They’re soft and smooth and rich and mellow. They’re ready to go and it feels luxurious.” She says if you’re aging cocktails more than two weeks, leave out the water and bitters and add them when you serve the drink.

384,Birds Again: A low-alcohol batch cocktail recipe,"You’re familiar with sours made with tequila (hey, margarita) and rum (that’s a daiquiri). You’ve probably had a pisco sour or a sidecar. But what happens when you skip the strong spirit and pour in tangy Sauvignon Blanc and herbal dry vermouth instead? Scented with basil and rose water, this low-proof easy drinker from Shaun Traxler of Vault in Fayetteville, Arkansas, is bright and refreshing but still more cocktail than sangria. Chill the wine and vermouth before you begin, and if you really want to ace the presentation, garnish the pitcher with food-grade rosebuds or rose petals. You’ll need one large or two small bottles of vermouth for this recipe.

Birds Again

If not serving immediately, seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

385,The Blaylock: A mocktail recipe for summer parties,"Have you ever drizzled a really good grapefruit with honey? It’s one of those perfect combinations, so it’s not shocking that the pairing works in a glass, too, as Milwaukee’s Adam James Sarkis demonstrates with this recipe. It couldn’t be simpler to combine honey, grapefruit, lemon, and seltzer, but the mixture is surprisingly complex in flavor, both tangy and rich. Make sure you have nine or ten grapefruits; yields will depend on whether you’re using an electric juicer or squeezing them by hand. Prep the honey syrup at least an hour — and up to a week — in advance, so it’s properly cooled when you start the batch.

The Blaylock

Makes about 16 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

4 1/2 cups fresh pink grapefruit juice

1 cup plus

2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons chilled 2:1 honey syrup (recipe follows)

2 (1 L) bottles chilled seltzer

Lemon wedges (optional)

Up to 2 hours before serving, make the batch. Prepare grapefruit and lemon juices and pour into a 2-quart pitcher. Add chilled honey syrup and stir well to mix. If not serving immediately, seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

To serve, toast star anise pods (if desired) over high heat in a dry skillet, watching carefully, just until fragrant, about 45 seconds. Fill tall glasses with ice, then carefully fill glasses about halfway with chilled seltzer. Top with pitcher mix, give each glass one gentle stir, then garnish with star anise pod and lemon wedge, if desired.

2:1 HONEY SYRUP

Makes about 1 1/3 cups

1 cup honey

1/2 cup water

Combine honey and water in a small saucepan and warm over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture is uniformly blended. Do not let boil. Pour into a resealable container and let cool. Seal well and refrigerate for up to 1 month.

386,Riled and Wrangled: A cocktail recipe for baseball season,"This spicy shandy from Laura Wagner of the Monarch Bar in Kansas City beats the pants off your standard beer-and-lemonade combo. Serrano-spiked honey and herb-inflected green Chartreuse enhance the peppery notes of whiskey and crisp kölsch or pilsner. Individual peppers can pack a varying amount of heat; if you’re nervous, use just a single chile.

Riled and Wrangled

Makes about 16 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

2 cups rye (such as Rittenhouse)

1 cup green Chartreuse

1 1/2 cups chilled serrano honey syrup (recipe follows)

1 1/2 cups fresh lemon juice

TO SERVE

6 bottles or cans chilled kölsch or pilsner

16 celery ribbons (shaved using a sharp vegetable peeler)

Up to 3 days before serving, make the batch. Pour rye, green Chartreuse, and chilled serrano honey syrup into a 2-quart pitcher and stir to mix. If not serving immediately, seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

Up to 2 hours before serving, prepare lemon juice and stir into pitcher mix. Reseal and return to refrigerator if not serving immediately.

To serve, stir mixture well. Fill pitcher with ice and stir gently until outside of pitcher is cool. Fill rocks glasses with ice, then carefully pour in kölsch to fill glass about halfway (letting foam settle). Top with pitcher mix and give each glass a quick stir. Adjust with additional beer or pitcher mix to taste, if desired. Garnish each glass with a ribbon of celery.

SERRANO HONEY SYRUP

Makes about 1 1/2 cups

1 to 1 1/2 serrano chiles, depending on heat desired

1 cup plus 2 tablespoons water

1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon honey

Slice chiles thinly, discarding stems and seeds. Place in small saucepan and gently crush with a muddler (you don’t need to make a puree). Add water and bring to a gentle simmer over medium-high heat. When you spot the first bubble, turn heat to low and keep warm for 6 minutes. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer into a resealable container. Stir in honey until fully incorporated, then let cool and refrigerate until chilled or for up to 1 week.

387,Infinity Pool: The perfect summer cocktail recipe,"Cucumber is often praised for its cooling properties, but what about celery? Throw some chopped stalks in a juicer (or, if you’re patient, puree about a dozen in a blender and strain) and you’ve got one of the most refreshing cocktail bases I can imagine. Los Angeles bartender Gabriella Mlynarczyk knows how to use it well, mellowing out the vegetal character of the stalks with citrusy Lillet blanc and lemon juice. The drink’s savory side is supported with mezcal, celery bitters, and a pinch of smoked salt. You’ll want to pour it into a big thermos and bring it to the beach. Starting with chilled mezcal and Lillet means less time waiting for the fridge to do its job.

Infinity Pool

Makes about 10 servings in a 2-quart pitcher

INGREDIENTS

1 1/3 cups chilled mezcal

1 1/3 cups chilled Lillet blanc

2/3 cup chilled 1:1 simple syrup(recipe follows)

2 1/4 teaspoons celery bitters

3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons water

1 1/3 cups fresh celery juice (from about 12 celery stalks)

1 cup fresh lemon juice

TO SERVE

Smoked sea salt

Thinly sliced lemon wheels (optional)

Up to 1 day before serving, make the batch. Pour chilled mezcal, chilled Lillet blanc, chilled simple syrup, celery bitters, and water into a 2-quart pitcher and stir to mix. Seal well, covering with plastic wrap if needed, and refrigerate.

Up to 2 hours before serving, prepare celery and lemon juices and stir into pitcher mix. Reseal and return to refrigerator if not serving immediately.

To serve, stir mixture well. Place a large ice cube in each rocks glass, then pour in cocktail and garnish with a small pinch of smoked salt and a lemon wheel, if desired.

USE IT UP

On Chicago bartender Chris Muscardin’s advice, skip the vermouth in your next martini and try Lillet blanc instead. Half and half is a lovely ratio to start with; up the gin if you like things drier. Lemon twist and orange bitters, if you please.

1:1 SIMPLE SYRUP

Makes about 1 cup plus 3 tablespoons

3/4 cup sugar

3/4 cup very hot water

Combine sugar and hot water in a resealable container, such as a mason jar, and stir to dissolve slightly. As soon as it’s cool enough to handle, seal container and shake until sugar is completely dissolved. Let cool completely and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

389,Tax Day is coming soon. What you need for July 15,"Call it the never-ending tax season.

It may be hard to believe, but taxpayers have approximately six weeks to file their 2019 income tax returns and pay taxes owed to the IRS.

July 15 is the new Tax Day, as the Treasury Department moved the deadline to help taxpayers contend with disruption related to the coronavirus pandemic.

For accountants, the new deadline is added stress. Many have been spending the last two months guiding small businesses through the CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program -- and they’re swamped.

“What we’d normally be doing in March and April is what we’re getting into now,” said Brian Streig, CPA and tax director at Calhoun Thomson and Matza in Austin.

“Now you have all of these tax returns, and we’re getting them all done by July 15,” he said. “We’re in extension mode, like we would’ve been back in March.”

Tax filers who aren’t confident they’ll get their paperwork ready by next month can request an extension.

That would give them until Oct. 15 to submit returns, but they’ll still need to pay any taxes owed by July 15.

What needs to be in

The due date for 2019 individual income tax returns, along with that year’s tax payment, are just two of the items that were pushed into July.

People who pay quarterly estimated taxes – for instance, independent contractors – were also given until July 15 to cover amounts due for the first and second quarter of 2020.

Ordinarily, those deadlines would have been April 15 and June 15, respectively.

Further, Americans abroad, who would have normally had until June 15 to submit their 2019 tax return, now have until next month to file and pay taxes due.

The IRS compiled a list of spring deadlines that have been pushed into July here.

Just as filers have more time to turn in last year’s tax returns, they also have extra time to top off their savings accounts.

You have until July 15 to save up to $6,000 in your individual retirement account (plus $1,000 if you’re 50 and over), and have the contribution count for 2019.

Many savers can also claim a tax deduction for making that IRA contribution, based on their modified adjusted gross income for 2019, even if they had a retirement plan at work.

If you were in a high-deductible health plan, you can also stash more money into a health savings account.

You normally save in an HSA on a tax-deductible or pretax basis and have your money grow tax free over time. If you use the proceeds to cover qualified medical costs, you can do so tax free.

For 2019, the maximum contribution is $3,500 for self-only coverage ($7,000 for family plans). Accountholders turning 55 can throw in an extra $1,000.

Regroup and file

Don’t wait until the day before the deadline to pluck last-minute deductions and credits.

You might qualify for a couple of “tax extenders,” a package of tax breaks that must be renewed by legislators each year. Those write-offs include a $4,000 deduction for tuition and fees for your college student – and you don’t have to itemize on your taxes to scoop this one up.

You won’t know you qualify until you perform an inventory of your statements from last year, of course.

Taxpayers should also pay close attention to what’s going on at the state level. While most states have pushed their filing deadlines to July 15, not all of them have. Filers in Virginia, for instance, were supposed to pay individual and corporate income taxes by June 1.

The American Institute of CPAs keeps a list of states and their deadline updates here.

Finally, if you’re due a refund and you need the money, hustle your paperwork to the IRS. The taxman issued 89.8 million refunds as of May 22, giving filers an average check of $2,772.

“If you’re getting a refund, just file your return and get it,” said Thomas Neuhoff, CPA at Henry & Peters in Tyler, Texas.

390,9 ways to help kids through the coronavirus crisis,"There’s no question the coronavirus shutdown has been disruptive for children. How they weather the disruption may depend on the response they see from their parents, says California Surgeon General Dr. Nadine Burke Harris.

“They really get their cues about what this means from their caregivers,” says Dr. Burke Harris, a pediatrician and expert on child stress. “And so there’s an incredible opportunity for caregivers to be a buffer to the stress of the current situation.”

Many parents interviewed by TODAY about how their children view the crisis expressed frustration about not being present enough for their children. They worried about not getting enough work done and fretted that they weren’t making this time as enriching as possible.

Experts in child development encourage parents to relax and focus on bonding and connection.

“This is not about perfection in any way. This is about being good enough,” says Dr. Tovah Klein, director of Barnard’s Center for Toddler Development. “Be reasonable. What you could do before, you cannot do now and that’s OK.”

Here are 9 ways to help your children through the coronavirus crisis.

1. Lower your standards. No, lower.

This one might be hard: Lower your expectations for your children, who might be struggling in ways you can’t yet understand, and lower expectations for yourself as a parent, partner and employee.

Working parents simply can't do what they used to do at work for now, or be as attentive to their children as they would have been on a day when they aren't working.

“We have to set different expectations for ourselves,” says Jennifer Miller, a family educational consultant and author of “Confident Parents, Confident Kids.”

Parents shouldn't feel guilty about doing what they have no choice but to do.

“When your child is asking you to play and you can’t, I think it’s time for a really good hug and a move on,” Miller says.

""I miss being with my friends and interacting with them in the hallways and lunch,"" said 17-year-old Hamiz Qadri. Nathan Congleton / TODAY

2. Talk about feelings

Discuss what’s going on in kid friendly terms. Don’t try to pretend everything is fine.

“We know from research and from common sense that children can’t learn if they are having big feelings like fear and worry, and we know that they are having those feelings,” says Jennifer Miller, a family and educational consultant and author of “Confident Parents, Confident Kids.”

Miller says just acknowledging feelings is powerful. Then, help guide them to simple and healthy coping strategies, like stopping to put a hand on their chest and feel their heartbeats, breathing deeply or going outside for fresh air.

“Giving them messages that we’re going to be OK is really important and really will help children bounce back,” says Klein, author of “How Toddlers Thrive.” “Children respond to the adults in their life.”",0
391,How to turn your daily walk into a workout — or a meditation,"When you’re cooped up inside all day, any chance you can get to enjoy a walk is a welcome reprieve from the monotony of quarantine. Sure, your at-home workouts are keeping you in shape, but a daily walk can boost your mental health and has many social and emotional benefits.

“Walking allows you to see other people and say hello at a safe distance. That brief social interaction is enough to boost your mood and make you smile. It’s also a nice change of scenery,” says Michele Stanten, an ACE-certified trainer and author of “Walk Off Weight.” “I like taking socially distanced walks with a friend. We’re able to spread far apart while carrying on a conversation. It allows you to physically be with a friend and exercise,” she says.

Walking also offers the opportunity to connect with nature, relieve stress and bring more mindfulness to your day. “Although walking is a benefit at any time, going for a meditative walk during quarantine is of particular value,” says Alexis Santos, a meditation teacher featured on Ten Percent Happier, a mindfulness and meditation app. “Going for a walk helps to break the patterns of thought and anxiety that we may be getting swept up into. It’s a great way to push the reset button.”

If you’re spending most of your day sitting in front of your computer, walking is also an excellent way to reduce pain. “Your joints stiffen up throughout the day, especially if you’re sitting often, so walking helps loosen things up and improve blood circulation,” Stanten says.

Ready to mask up and go for a walk? Stanten and Santos share how to turn your socially distanced walks into a workout or a meditative experience.

How to burn more calories and build strength while walking

Stanten gives pointers on how to supercharge your daily walk:

Walk with good posture. “Stand up tall and bend your arms, keeping them close to the body —not flailing them up high,” Stanten says. Contrary to what most people think, she advises taking shorter steps. “Land your foot in front of your body to move more fluidly and faster. Taking larger steps makes it harder to pull your body forward,” she says.

Contrary to what most people think, she advises taking shorter steps. “Land your foot in front of your body to move more fluidly and faster. Taking larger steps makes it harder to pull your body forward,” she says. Change up the terrain. Walk on grass, sand, dirt paths, flat roads, up hills and down hills to challenge your body. “If you can find a hill to walk on, it will provide a great incline and get your heart rate going. The wind resistance also feels different on a hill and makes it more challenging to move against it,” Stanten says.

The wind resistance also feels different on a hill and makes it more challenging to move against it,” Stanten says. Pick up the pace. Incorporate intervals into your walk by alternating between bouts of intense effort with a slower-paced trot. “Aim to walk towards something, like a lamp post or stop sign. Walk fast for 30 seconds or one block and walk slower for 60 seconds or two blocks,” Stanten says. Listening to music? Speed up with the chorus of a song and slow down during the verses. Count the number of steps you take during an interval and try to beat that number in the same amount of time.

Stanten recommends mixing in some bodyweight exercises, like lunges with rotation, heel raises, push-ups and squats. “You can also bring a longer resistance band with you and loop it around a sturdy pole to do lat pull-downs and rows,” Stanten says. Use mini bands for lateral squat walks and glute kickbacks.

How to take a meditative walk to reduce stress

Santos shares tips to make your walk more mindful:

Be mindful of your surroundings. To make your walk more relaxing, Santos says choosing more peaceful walking paths can help. “If possible, find walks that have some nature elements like trees and water. These tend to be soothing for the mind,” he says.

Focus on your own thoughts. If you can’t find isolated walking paths, Santos says working with your own thoughts can be effective in easing the mind. “When you see people not wearing masks, Santos says you can turn your negative thoughts into a more positive wish, like ‘may they be safe and healthy.’ It’s important that our efforts to stay healthy don’t slide into fear and anxiety of each other,” Santos cautions.

Walk with intention. Avoid going on autopilot during your walk, Santos says. Turn your attention to what is going on around you and allow your body to move in a relaxed way. Notice how your feet are touching the ground, the way your legs and arms are swinging and your lungs filling up with air. This will change your perspective and draw awareness to the benefits, such as the warm sun and the alone time.

392,5 exercises to tighten and tone your arms for summer,"We all have those trouble zones we're self-conscious about and want to tone up. Perhaps it’s your midsection or your glutes. For many, upper arms top the list, and this is the time of year this insecurity is brought to light.

The good news is that by adding the right exercises to your workout routine you can start strengthening the muscles in your arms rather quickly. One of my clients added a 5-minute arm routine to her typical workout routine and noticed a change after just three sessions. Within a week she already felt more confident in her sleeveless tops and dresses.

If tightening and toning the arms is on your list of summer goals, try adding these exercises to your fitness regimen three times a week. I recommend performing them with 3-5 pound dumbbells. Remember that some exercises may be easier than others, so it’s okay to alternate between weights based on what feels right for your body.

My favorite way to put these exercises together is to perform one set of 10 repetitions of each, and then repeat the whole circuit three times. In the end, you’ll complete 30 repetitions total of each exercise.

Bicep Curls

The bicep curl is the quintessential arm exercise. It tones and strengthens the front of the arms, which many people associate with the ability to “flex a muscle.”

To perform this exercise, grab your dumbbells and start with your arms by your sides. Hug your elbows in towards the side of your body, and then curl the weights up towards your shoulders. Be careful not to let your arms swing. (If you need to swing your arms and use momentum to get the weight up, you are likely using too heavy of a weight.) Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

Tricep Kickbacks

The triceps are what people are referring to when they say that their arms are flabby. This is the part of the arm that jiggles when you wave. (During one of my workout segments for the “Today Show,” Kathie Lee called them bat wings!) In order to tighten this area and reduce ""jiggle"" it’s necessary to strengthen the backs of the arms. The most basic dumbbell exercise to accomplish this is a tricep kickback. Holding weights in both hands, lean forward with a flat back. Hug your elbows in towards your sides and pull them up towards the ceiling. Keeping your elbows still, kick the weight towards the back of the room by moving the lower half of your arm back and up towards the ceiling. Hold for a second, feeling the back of your arm tighten, and then release back to the starting position. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

Hug a Tree

This exercise works the biceps from a different angle, while also working the sides of the chest (and that pesky area by the armpits) and sculpting the shoulders. Hold the weights at shoulder height, parallel to the floor. Relax the shoulders down, and then hug the arms towards the front of your body as if you’re hugging a tree. Keep the elbows level with your shoulders — don’t let them dip down — and be conscious of the shoulders starting to raise up towards your ears, which means the weight is too heavy or you’re too fatigued. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

Serve the Platter

This move is a three-in-one, working the biceps, shoulder and chest. Start with your arms at your side, bending your elbows at 90 degrees. Reach the arms forward, straightening them as if you’re serving a platter, then reach them out to the sides in a “T” position, back to center, and then pull them back in towards you. Keep the palms facing up the entire time. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

V exercises

The ultimate toner for the front of the shoulder is the V exercise. For this exercise, hold your dumbbells down at your hips. Then reach the weights forward and up on an angle, drawing a V, and then release them back down towards your hips. Keep the arms straight throughout the entire exercise. Repeat this 10 times, and complete 3 sets total throughout your workout.

393,"Better than takeout: 5 cheaper, healthier versions of your favorite Indian dishes","The spices and sauces of Indian food might make it feel too intimidating to prepare yourself. But you don’t have to turn to takeout to enjoy your favorite dishes. These food pros step you through healthier, less-expensive versions of top Indian picks you can make at home.

CHICKEN BIRYANI

Roxana Begum, a registered dietitian who blogs at the Delicious Crescent, says her childhood home, Hyderabad, India, is famous for its biryani. This easy, no-fuss chicken biryani recipe she shares cuts through the traditional steps without compromising on the “spectacular” biryani taste.

“This recipe gives me that authentic, mouth-watering biryani with tender spiced chicken and fluffy rice, every single time,” she says. “And for the cost of one biryani plate at a restaurant, you will get to feed the whole family with this easy homemade recipe!”

For can’t-fail rice, she recommends a rice cooker. “Using a rice cooker is a game changer that allows even the most novice of Indian cooks to try their hand at a true culinary masterpiece,” she says.

LAMB MEATBALLS WITH ORANGE GLAZE

Pankaj Bhadouria, the first MasterChef from India, loves the international appeal of this dish. “Call them meatballs or koftas, we see them being cooked all across the globe,” she says. “This version is slightly sweet, tangy, and salty, with a little heat coming in from the paprika. It would go well with rice, noodles, and breads alike, so it is a sure winner for me.”

Bhadouria bakes these lamb meatballs with orange glaze, using oil only to grease the baking tray, so she says they are healthier than most deep-fried takeout meatballs.

CHICKEN SHAWARMA

Ranveer Brar grew up on the streets of Lucknow, India, and the kebab vendors there inspired his career as a chef. “Shawarma is an offshoot of the doner kebab,” he says. “My version of chicken shawarma is an attempt to interpret the flavors and culture behind the original recipe while adding a touch of Indian to it.”

He likes how this dish is easy to prepare and uses less cooking fat than most versions, but still brings subtle nuances in flavor. While the recipe calls for a nonstick pan, Brar says the chicken could be oven grilled if you prefer.

LAMB ROGAN JOSH

Savita Verma, the blogger behind Chef De Home, says she grew up on Indian food and likes to make over restaurant recipes so they are simpler and healthier. She shares her version of lamb rogan josh, which you can prepare ahead of time in your slow cooker or Instant Pot.

This dish comes together without much effort, but is still packed with complex flavor. “The lamb comes out bone tender, and the curry is bursting with the flavor of the spices,” she says.

She loves to make a batch over the weekend and portion and freeze it: “On weeknights, heat it and enjoy a restaurant-quality Indian dinner without ordering delivery.”",0
394,How to make the perfect pesto — and 5 recipes to get you started,"“What most people associate with pesto is classic pesto Genovese, which is the perfect balance of nutty, sweet, salty, buttery and umami,” TV personality, cookbook author, and restaurateur Giada De Laurentiis tells NBC News BETTER. But in her own kitchen, De Laurentiis prefers to think about what pesto actually means, “any sauce that has been pounded or crushed.” Pesto comes from pestare, Italian for “to pound” or “to crush.”

The traditional blend of basil, garlic, Parmesan and pine nuts is an Italian classic for a reason, but being more flexible with your ingredient list “opens the door for so much more,” explains Laurentiis, who likes to make pesto with everything from parsley to peas to broccoli. Here, she shares pointers for achieving pesto perfection at home, plus five favorite recipes and creative ideas for using each one.

One of pesto’s selling points is that it can be made by hand, with a mortar and pestle or in a food processor. It all depends on how much time you have and what you prefer. For De Laurentiis, the answer is easy.

“Let’s be honest, I’m a busy mom, so the food processor is much easier and quicker for me to whip up any kind of pesto rather than pulling out the old mortar and pestle.” Regardless of method, De Laurentiis recommends starting with ingredients that take the longest to chop, such as garlic and any nuts, and adding more delicate ones like herbs and baby greens towards the end. “You don’t want to bruise them up too much,” she warns.

If you opt for using the food processor, “always pulse in the Parmesan or other cheese at the end or stir it in by hand,” says De Laurentiis. That way, the heat of the machine won’t melt the cheese.

Mix it up

As you can see from the recipes included here, pesto is ripe for experimentation, so take a cue from De Laurentiis and play with different combinations to suit your palate and the meal you want to make.

“Always think about balancing flavors and textures,” advises De Laurentiis. “For so few ingredients, pesto is rather complex, and you don’t want one ingredient to stand out too much from the others.” To achieve a balanced sauce, De Laurentiis says “to start slow and taste along the way.”

Go beyond pasta

Pesto and pasta may be perfect partners, but with such a versatile sauce, it would be a shame to limit yourself to penne and pappardelle. “There are so many uses!” insists De Laurentiis.

Add a little acid — think lemon juice or vinegar — to make a dressing for salads or a sauce for steak or fish. Another easy option is to stir pesto into Greek yogurt for an easy, creamy dip for vegetables or to spread over chicken before baking.

Store like a pro

Pesto may be easy to make but that doesn’t mean you want any to go to waste. Whether you make a big batch or just have some leftovers, proper storage is key. De Laurentiis recommends keeping pesto in an airtight container in the refrigerator, but it’s also important to take an extra step to keep your sauce fresh and green. “I always pour a layer of olive oil over the top and then place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the oil,” she says.

Pesto 5 ways

Orecchiette Pasta with Almond Pesto. Elizabeth Newman

This almost classic pesto features almonds in place of pine nuts. De Laurentiis adds creamy mozzarella, sweet cherry tomatoes and warm pasta for a fuss-free supper, but the vibrant sauce is also a great match for blanched green beans. Think of it as a new twist on green beans almondine, says De Laurentiis.

Orzo with Artichoke Pesto and Grilled Corn Elizabeth Newman

Frozen artichokes, toasted walnuts, parsley, oregano and a heavy hit of Parmesan come together in this unexpected take on pesto. In addition to the corn and orzo combo here, De Laurentiis likes to spread this pesto on chicken sandwiches.

Grilled Chicken and Broccoli Pesto Panini Food Network

Broccoli is blended with walnuts, lemon, Parmesan and a touch of honey to create a slightly heartier pesto that De Laurentiis serves with grilled chicken, thick rounds of beefsteak tomato, and rustic bread. For a play on a classic pasta, she recommends tossing this pesto with orecchiette and spicy Italian sausage.

Parsley Lemon Pesto Ray Kachatorian

This parsley, pine nut and lemon combination is a great year-round pesto and if you add a bit more olive oil to the mix, De Laurentiis says it makes a great dressing for greens or a flavor-packed sauce for grilled chicken or salmon.

Pea Pesto Crostini Elizabeth Newman

To create this yummy spread, De Laurentiis pulses frozen peas with garlic, Parmesan, olive oil, salt and pepper. It also makes a dynamite filling for tortellini. In fact, that’s how De Laurentiis uses it at her restaurant in Las Vegas.

395,These simple financial tweaks can help you survive — and even thrive — during the pandemic,"We are all getting back to the basics.

While it might feel good to bake bread, the best way to get through the coronavirus pandemic could be to stock your emergency fund and learn to “do-it-yourself” with household chores so you can save on expenses.

One bright spot: You might have more time on your hands.

Think optimistically. You can learn to DIY, sock away cash and set a disaster budget for tough times.

If you’ve been putting off thinking about money, now’s the time to dedicate those extra hours in the week — no more commuting, no more rushed work mornings — to shoring up your finances.

Be a bean counter

Hold off on panicking by looking ahead, says Sasha Hutchison, 38, an accounting manager and personal finance blogger in Austin, Texas.

Take a look at your net worth: what you owe, what you can do to bring in cash now. “It helps you to feel more in control,” Hutchison said.

When Hutchison says to look at everything, she means everything. A health savings account or a flexible spending account through your job can help pay for health care. How much cash do you have on hand? What’s in your portfolio, even if it’s shrinking? It might be a difficult time to collect from anyone who owes you money — but still good to know that it’s out there.

Cash-back credit cards can be another source. Groceries and gas help accumulate points quickly. (Hutchison pays off the balance each month.)

Cash cushion

Liz Gendreau, 39, says you'll never regret stashing cash against an emergency - even if one never materializes. Source: Liz Gendreau

An emergency fund is more critical than ever. In one week in March, things changed almost daily, says Liz Gendreau, 39, who blogs about family finance on her website, Chief Mom Officer.

“You might get reduced hours, a pay cut,” said Gendreau, who lives in Hartford County, Connecticut. “Before that happens, ideally, is the time to take a really close look at your budget.”

You’ll never regret having emergency savings — only not saving while you had the chance.

When things go back to the way they were, you can use that pile of cash to pay off debt or for something you wanted to do.

A budget for slim times

Got a budget? That’s great. Now might be a very good time to create and use the emergency version.

According to Heather Albrecht, 37, a financial coach in Hartford, Vermont, it’s best to make this plan before you need it. It’s so much easier when you don’t look for things to cut under duress. Write it down, so you can pull it out and see the plan you’ve made.

What small luxuries do you want to keep? What you can live without? The more you cut, the longer you can make savings last.

“Be ruthless,” Albrecht said. “You can always add in things if you feel you can’t live without them.”

Hello, DIY

Many people outsource practically everything, from housecleaning to yard work to delivery services, says Tara Koup, 43, a writer for QVC who lives in Paoli, Pennsylvania.

Koup says these practical skills are a top way to save.

In the pre-Covid-19 world, people turned to pros because they were busy and pressured.

But more time at home means less of an excuse to avoid learning to cook, clean, conserve, reuse.

“I use what is around me for free instead of purchasing,” Koup said. “Living simply is a good way to save money in the long run.”

396,These chicken kabobs will be your new go-to recipe for BBQ season,"Kabobs may just be the perfect summer party food. They're easy to munch while holding a cocktail and they leave no dirty plates or utensils to clean up afterwards. Even better, you can please vegetarians and meat lovers alike without having to make two separate entrees.

The secret to a juicy, flavor-packed kabob is all in the marinade, which is prepped a day before, meaning less to do the day of a gathering. If you still haven’t found one that does the trick, don’t worry. This recipe from Andrea Correale, celebrity caterer and Founder of Elegant Affairs, is perfect for feeding a crowd in your own backyard or bringing along to a Memorial Day party this year.

“If you are using wood skewers make sure you soak them overnight first before putting the meat and veggies on them. Also make sure they are 12” skewers,” says Correale. “In order to get a good flavor, soak the meat and veggies for 24 hours before skewering.""

She also suggests using chicken thigh meat instead of breast meat for the most tender kabobs, and recommends always cooking them at about 350 degrees or medium heat. (If using a thermometer, meat should be 165 degrees.)

While the kabobs themselves are packed with flavor, Correale likes to serve them up with a few different dipping sauces as well, which makes the spread even more fun by letting your guests customize their meal with an extra pop of flavor. Some of her favorite pairings include:

Chimichurri

Chipotle aioli

Basil aioli

Basil pesto

Sundried tomato pesto

Red pepper relish

Lemon thyme vinaigrette

Hoisin or an Asian style sauce

And what about the rest of the spread? Correale serves her kabobs with grilled corn, corn salad or street corn, a potato salad or a farro or quinoa salad — or all three if you’re putting out a spread for a backyard party this season!

Now for the recipe. Simply toss all the ingredients together and add cubed chicken and/or veggies the night before, and you’ll be ready to thread on skewers and fire up the grill to feed your Memorial Day crowd.

Chicken Kabob Marinade

Yields 12 servings

Ingredients

1 cup oil

1 cup aged balsamic or sherry vinegar

½ cup low-sodium soy sauce

½ cup Worcestershire sauce

¼ cup lemon juice

1 ¼ cup brown sugar

4 tablespoons fresh rosemary

4 tablespoons Dijon mustard

2 teaspoons ground black pepper

4 teaspoons garlic powder

16 pieces of de-boned chicken thighs

To serve

Combine all ingredients in a freezer bag or in Pyrex dishes. Cover the kabobs well and put in the fridge to marinate for 12-24 hours. The next day they will be ready to thread onto skewers and grill.

When you're stuck at home all day, the line between snacks and meals is getting blurrier so it’s more important than ever to choose filling and nutritious options. Your best chance of getting through the day without distracting hunger is to choose a protein- and fiber-rich snack. Snacks that contain whole food sources of protein and fiber (say, from some combo of nuts, veggies, fruits, beans, eggs, or yogurt) offer a winning formula that keeps you full for hours. Plus, if your snack is dominant in protein- and fiber-rich food sources, these healthful ingredients are likely crowding out less healthful ones, namely added sugar and refined grains. Here are some pointers for picking a healthy, high protein, high fiber snack, along with some tasty options that fit the parameters.

What to look for in a healthy snack

At least 3 grams of fiber (you need around 25-38 grams per day)

5 or more grams of protein (for reference, a boiled egg has about 6 grams)

No more than 6 grams of added sugar (about 1 ½ teaspoons, but lower is better)

Wholesome ingredients, like beans, nuts, seeds, fruits, veggies, eggs, yogurt, and cheese

No artificial sweeteners, like sucralose or aspartame (the stuff in the yellow and blue packets)

No artificial colors or preservatives (often clues that something is overly processed)

Be 'calorie aware'

It’s not necessary to tether yourself to a calorie counting app, but it’s a good idea to be calorie aware and to energize (another way of saying consume calories) in line with your activity and needs. There’s a wide range of calorie needs, and your requirements may vary depending on the day (maybe you had a light lunch or maybe you participated in a killer workout or you might have a long stretch before dinner). Be realistic about your needs and goals. A good snack range is between 100 to 300 calories. Here are some ideas to get you off and running.

Healthy snacks at grocery store

In a pinch, you can find plenty of snacks that offer hunger-taming amounts of protein and fiber for grab-and-go eating.

You’ll score 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein in this restaurant style tortilla chip. The first ingredient is whole great northern beans, which provide the protein and fiber punch. Dip a serving of chips into some jarred, no added sugar salsa to boost the nutrition content while sticking close to the 130-calorie count from the chips.

Or, stash a a mini guac from Wholly Guacamole in your office fridge to pair the chips with some plant-based fats.

This is like string cheese’s sophisticated cousin, with a nutty, full-bodied flavor that happens to deliver 7 grams of protein per snack-size package. Pair it with a cup of strawberries to hit your fiber targets, or serve it with some grain and seed crackers, like these Mary’s Gone Crackers.

A bar made from whole food ingredients can tide you over in a pinch. These bars get protein from eggs and fiber from nuts, so they’re about the next best thing to a DIY snack. Each RXBAR has 12 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber, and they’re sweetened with dates instead of added sugar. For a lighter snack that’s just as tasty and portable, their kiddie version supplies 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber for fewer calories.

A snack pack of almonds might be just what you need to get through a hangry afternoon. The 250-calorie snack-size portion supplies 5 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protein. You can pair the bag — either all of it or just half of it — with a fruit or veggie of your choice for a more balanced, protein- and fiber-rich snack.

Healthy snacks you can make at home

Lemon Tofu Creme over Strawberries Courtesy of Lauren Harris-Pincus

Love it or hate it, you can’t argue with tofu’s versatility. Here, it channels lemon crème sauce, yet it’s vegan, dairy- and gluten-free. Serve it atop strawberries (as shown) and you’ll get 5 grams of protein and fiber. Top with nuts and you’ll get even more of both nutrients.

Pumpkin Pie Smoothie Courtesy of Lauren Harris-Pincus

Smoothie shop smoothies can be a great way to amp up your fruit and veggie intake, but their calorie counts are often closer to a meal than a snack. If you have a blender handy, you can make this luscious treat, which has 9 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber for just 100 calories. And don’t forget about canned pumpkin once the weather warms. Pumpkin puree is an all-star staple that bumps up the nutrition in smoothies and other dishes.

Chocolate Banana Kefir Chia Pudding Courtesy of Lindsey Janeiro

This chocolate treat might become your new snack hero. It checks all the boxes! Chocolate? Check! Naturally sweetened? Check! Protein and fiber? Check, check with 8 grams and 9 grams respectively. It's also great for your gut since it contains both pre- and probiotics.

Lemon Ginger Hummus Courtesy of Lindsey Janeiro

You can buy hummus from the store (no shame!) or you could easily whip up your own flavorful version, like this one. A serving has 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein, but you can boost both further depending on the dipper you choose.

3-Ingredient Cocoa Almond Truffles Courtesy of Marisa Moore

They may sound like a treat, but these no-added-sugar bites are made with wholesome ingredients, like almonds and dates. A snack like this — with both 5 grams of protein and fiber — is the perfect way to satisfy a sweet tooth and chase away hunger. Bonus: The cocoa dusting has brain-boosting antioxidants.",0
398,'I am constantly on the verge of a panic attack' — Americans are burned out working from home. Here's how to cope,"It turns out that ditching the commute and working from home in your sweats is not all it’s cracked up to be.

Juggling your work and home life, Zoom calls instead of in-person meetings and possibly parenting and home schooling kids, it’s no wonder Americans are exhausted.

In fact, in a recent Monster survey, 51% of respondents admitted to experiencing burnout while working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.

“Their home, which is normally a sanctuary and place to rest and relax with family, has instantly morphed into their office,” said Vicki Salemi, a Monster career expert.

That’s despite taking breaks for self-care throughout the day: 71% of those surveyed said they were stepping away from work for things like walks or spending time with family.

The culprit: a lack of structure and routine to your work day, Salemi said.

On top of that, we are isolated from those outside our immediate family, facing uncertainty about our health and the status of the virus, and parents are parenting all the time, added licensed psychologist Melissa L. Whitson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of New Haven in Connecticut.

There is also financial anxiety. While those working remotely still have a job, as opposed to the more than 30 million Americans who have filed unemployment claims since March, there is the threat that they, too, could lose their paycheck or have their salary cut at some point if the recession continues, she said.

“There is still that, ‘I need to work while I’m making money now and also to show that I am a good employee so they keep me on,’” Whitson said. “There is that added pressure onto it.”

‘Constantly on the verge of a panic attack’

Alana Acosta-Lahullier, 41, understands that feeling of burnout. With two children and a full-time job, she is exhausted all the time.

She helps with her the schooling of her 7-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son while she works from home full-time for an electrical contractor. Her son has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and is on the autism spectrum, so he needs some extra help. Her husband works out of the home as a police officer.

“I am constantly on the verge of a panic attack,” said Acosta-Lahullier, who lives in Parsippany, New Jersey.

While her employer is very understanding, she feels the need to get everything done correctly.

“I find myself working all the time, even when I should be getting ready for bed,” Acosta-Lahullier said. “I feel an obligation to get everything done, even if it’s to the detriment of my own mental health.”

On top of that she has “mother’s guilt.”

“I need to make sure that everybody I have to take care of has everything they need,” she said. “I put this constant pressure on myself.”

‘Depressing monotony’

For 45-year-old David Hoffman, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and leads operations for a business unit of a large multinational company, the stress sometimes causes him to get “really short and snap.”

As the primary caregiver during the day to his three children, who are in first, third and sixth grade, he spends the day giving guidance on their various school assignments. He’s also trying to get his work done.

“Eight weeks of constant abnormal working and this heavy support and kids stuck in the house is stressful,” said Hoffman, whose wife has a full-time job in health-care administration at a local hospital.

He finds himself starting work earlier than he did while in the office, working later and doing more work at night after the kids have gone to bed in order to catch up.

“It’s just this monotony, this depressing monotony,” he said.

“It seems like it never ends. You go to sleep and you are right back at it.”

How to cope

The first thing you should do is to be kind to yourself and know that the stress manifests itself differently in different people, Whitson said.

You may be more angry or irritable, or you may appear to be more depressed or withdrawn. Recognize and accept that you may be experiencing any of these symptoms.

To help alleviate the stress, try to implement a routine and structure in your day-to-day life.

“When you are always on, your system gets overwhelmed and exhausted,” Whitson said.

Monster’s Salemi recommends waking up each morning as you would if you were commuting to your job. Get dressed and have breakfast. Put it on your calendar and create a routine around it, she said.

More from Invest in You : Expert tips on coping with coronavirus-related money stressors

At the end of your normal workday, stop working and put your laptop out of sight.

If you are juggling kids’ school work and parenting, build that into your routine, as well. If you are able, work in a different room to do your job so that you can focus better. Trade off parenting duties with your partner, if possible.

Building a sense of community can also help, Whitson said. Make a point to have virtual meetings to connect with colleagues and online social gatherings with friends.

Not only can it increase your well-being, it can have “profound effects” on productivity and satisfaction in the workplace, she said.

Lastly, don’t be afraid to reach out for help from counselors or other support networks if you need it.

“We are all in this together,” Whitson said. “It is helpful to know that other people are in the same boat.

“Just find out what works for you and, if it’s not working, try something new,” she added. “It is not a one-size-fits-all.”",0
399,"It's not just quarantine that's getting us down — it's decision fatigue, too","I’m finding that with this pandemic, there’s a never-ending list of things I need to think through and decide. Things like:

Do I have a clean mask to wear when I go shopping?

Is it safe to take my cats to the vet for their checkup?

What can we have for dinner that we can cook without running to the store?

How can I help my kids get ready to go back to school in the fall? What if they don’t go back?

These questions spin through my head, breaking my concentration during the day and waking me up at night. And I bet you have your own list of questions — big and small — running through your mind. All these decisions we need to make while we’re living through this pandemic are wearing us down. It’s overwhelming.

“These days even the smallest of decisions can stop us in our tracks,” says Melanie Ross Mills, a family relationship expert in Dallas.

This cognitive overload can lead to feelings of anxiety, irritability, stress and fatigue, according to Beth Darnall, Ph.D., associate professor and psychologist at Stanford University School of Medicine. “It requires adaptation to a level we haven’t experienced,” she says. “The most overused word with COVID is ‘unprecedented,’ but we don’t have a template for this level of cognitive overload.”

We can’t just go back to our old ways of doing things. But we can find ways to decrease the number of decisions we have to make. Here’s what the experts say.

Set up routines

When we have systems in place, we can eliminate some of the burden of making decisions. We make the decisions once, and then they run on autopilot. Susan Bernstein, a licensed social worker in Connecticut and Massachusetts and an adjunct faculty member at Boston University, says it’s helpful for us to automate as many decisions as possible now, because as areas start reopening, we’ll be faced with new rounds of decisions.

We can make it routine to:

Wash our masks as soon as we get home, and leave clean masks by the door.

Choose a day to go to the stores and batch our errands to minimize our trips out of the house.

Keep a running grocery list.

Pick a date for grocery deliveries. For example, Bernstein discovered she can reserve a Costco Instacart delivery two weeks in advance, and then add items to her cart before the delivery date.

Set a day for house cleaning. “A clean house makes a lot of people feel better,” Bernstein says. “It resets the energy in the home.”

Run the dishwasher at night so the dishes are clean in the morning.

Schedule alone time for each family member, even if that means “signing out” a room for 30 minutes or an hour.

Make lists

When we sit down and organize our thoughts, everything starts to settle, and we can make fewer decisions.

“I’m a big fan of writing everything down,” Bernstein says. That’s because information that’s swamping our brains can cause unnecessary distress. When you write something down, you have one less thing to fret about. “We can save our energy for important things like safety and maintaining our balance and our family’s balance,” she says.

Plus, it’s satisfying to cross things off our lists. “It’s always so nice to take that pen or dry erase marker and put a line through something,” Bernstein says.

Build in margins

These days, a lot of us are rushing through every minute. We’re tackling work projects, helping children with schoolwork, keeping our households running smoothly and caring for at-risk relatives.

It might be a challenge but taking a few minutes to stave off the feeling of being overwhelmed is important. “Leave space within your physical day, as well as in your mental state, so that you have enough bandwidth and energy to clearly make effective, productive, healthy decisions for yourself and those around you,” Mills says.

Factor in rewards

“In the middle of all this decision distress, where do you get a reward?” Bernstein asks. She likes the idea of routine nights when you order takeout or delivery. “If Thursday is dinner delivery day, that’s one less thing you have to ponder over, and you’re supporting a local restaurant — that’s a win-win,” she says.

Decide not to decide

When things are out of our control, we’re not deciding, we’re just worrying. We don’t know when our workplaces, schools, and shops will open, and we don’t know what those places will look like when they do. It’s frustrating — as humans, we don’t like uncertainty — but as much as we can, we need to try not to let our worries drain our mental energy.

Let it go once you decide

You’ve made your choice. Now don’t rethink it. “A lot of people have buyer’s remorse,” Bernstein says. “If you’re buying $200 worth of board games so your family functions in a happier state, that’s a good thing.”",0
400,Many Americans are unaware of the coronavirus-related financial assistance that's available to them,"Many unemployed people may not be aware of the coronavirus-related financial assistance that is available to them.

A whopping 80 percent of unemployed Americans say they haven’t reached out for relief measures, according to Credit Karma.

They think they don’t qualify. They’re overwhelmed by all the information. They don’t even know where to start.

These are the top reasons for not accessing assistance, according to the financial advice website, which surveyed 1,037 U.S. adults in April about their understanding of government relief measures related to COVID-19.

The stimulus checks are the top story, but you may be able to access other types of relief. Here’s what else you may qualify for.

You may qualify for paid leave

Qualified workers, including those telecommuting, can get two weeks of paid leave at full pay courtesy of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.

Valid reasons include being unable to work because you are under quarantine order, have coronavirus symptoms and are seeking diagnosis, or must care for a child whose school or daycare provider is shut.

If you’re caring for a sick family member, you might still qualify for a portion of your pay.

Help with utility bills

Many utility companies — including PG&E, Con Edison, American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy, among others — have suspended service disconnections.

You may be able to set up a payment plan for your utility bill or have some fees waived, such as for late payments. Check the website of your provider for assistance tapping into other support programs, such as Housing and Urban Development’s COVID-19 resources. Your state’s website may help. Some are stopping utility companies from shutting off services.

Sign up for insurance

If you lost your job and need health insurance, some states are holding special ACA open enrollments. AARP keeps an updated list of extensions on state health exchanges.

Uninsured people in Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York and Vermont can enroll for health insurance through their state exchanges through June 15. California is allowing state residents to enroll through June 30.

Find out if you qualify for Medicaid by inputting your state, family size and income level on the Healthcare.gov calculator.

Rent relief

The CARES Act has aid for homeowners who are struggling with their federally backed mortgage payments but renters also have some help.

Many states and cities have put a stop order on evictions. New York, for instance, has a 90-day eviction ban. A Columbia Law School professor frequently updates this list of state actions.

Tax postponement

The federal government has pushed the filing and payment deadline for 2019 income taxes to at least July 15 — and it could be as late as September.

You have time not only to do the paperwork but to come up with the money if you owe taxes. Many states have also delayed filing and payment, but not all. Check with your state or the American Institute of CPAs, which keeps an updated list.",0
401,How veterans can successfully transition into civilian workforce,"Switching careers is hard, but it can be particularly daunting for soldiers transitioning into civilian life.

They face a new reality that is very different from the one they are leaving behind. In fact, many feel they are at a disadvantage when it comes to finding work because they are starting over, a 2018 report found.

“Leaving the Army is a very difficult thing. They literally train you. They move your goods when you move. And they tell you what to wear and what time you show up for work,” said Bill Sweet, chief financial officer of financial planning firm Ritholtz Wealth.

Sweet understands those challenges. He served in the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of captain before leaving in 2007. During his service, he was stationed in Iraq during the Iraq War and earned a Bronze Star Medal for his actions.

Sweet was also fortunate enough to be assigned as a tax assistance officer for his battalion during his last year in active duty. That gave him a skill that ultimately lead him to his current career in finance.

Now, he wants to help other vets find success after their military careers. And there are many. Each year, about 200,000 service members return to their civilian communities.

Here are three key things veterans should focus on, according to Sweet.

Look for a translatable skill

Driving a tank in the desert probably isn’t going to translate to a job in New York City, Sweet said.

However, there are other ways to build an expertise and “ultimately take that with you in your toolkit, out to the civilian world,” he said.

“Tax was my avenue. But there’s a lot of translatable skills within a military organization.”

Those can be things like finance, public affairs and logistics, all of which are great points for your resume.

Ask for help

In the military, active service members are taught to be self-reliant.

However, when it comes to transitioning into the civilian workforce, they need to ask for help, Sweet said.

“In the military, you think you’re alone. You think you’re going to do this for the first time. No,” he said. “There’s somebody that’s walked [in] those shoes in front of you. And it’s a matter of finding them.”

There are a number of organizations that want to help and hire veterans of the military. Fourblock, a nonprofit that offers vets free semester-long, university accredited courses is one of them.

Veterans on Wall Street or VoWS, is another organization. VoWS connects military talent with Wall Street banks to get veterans into the industry.

Find a mentor

When trying to land a job or if you find yourself in a new one, try to find a mentor who can guide you by offering advice and helping you get to know the ins and outs of a given field or organization.

It will not only help you land a job or advance your career, it can also help you enjoy your work. According to a recent CNBC/SurveyMonkey survey, 9 in 10 workers (91%) said having a mentor made them significantly happier with their jobs.

Sweet credits his mentors, Ritholtz CEO Josh Brown and Ritholtz chairman and CIO Barry Ritholtz, for helping him succeed. Sweet landed at the firm several years after leaving the Army, with just one financial job under his belt.

“They were willing to take a big chance on a veteran with not a ton of experience in financial services,” he said. “I will always be grateful for that.”

402,How to Prepare for Your Job Search,"Getty Images/Hero Images

Starting the job search process can be overwhelming, but you can make it easier by focusing on your experience, skills, and interests. This will also help you develop your own brand. Use this guide as your job search plan of action:

Self-Assess: First, decide on the type of career you would like to have and consider how your experiences and skills fit into that path. After narrowing down your focus, research the positions you plan to apply for.

Brand Yourself: By determining what you have to offer, this will also help develop your brand. Play up your military experience as part of your brand, particularly for leadership and teamwork skills. The military is also a great place for learning discipline, problem-solving, communication skills, cultural understanding, project management, and how to take the initiative. To illustrate how your military training translates to a civilian workplace, explain that serving teaches people dedication, loyalty, following orders, and accomplishing goals.

Prepare: Put together your resume, pitch, and story for potential employers. This is important for networking and interviewing. Think about the skills and strengths you can play up. For example, hard skills include project management and problem-solving, while soft skills include working well with difficult people, doing a good job under pressure, negotiating or resolving conflicts, and working well managing or mentoring people.

Network: Networking is the best way to make contacts and to learn about jobs. By expanding your network, you’ll have a greater resource pool, the potential to meet more mentors, gain free advice, and get referrals for job interviews. To learn how to network, read our article here.

Apply: Use as many different sources as possible to learn about employment opportunities: search job boards, network, ask contacts, and use tools like LinkedIn. Then, apply for jobs.

Interview: During the interview, it’s crucial to show why you’re a good fit for the job. Highlight your past experiences and explain what makes you capable. To make a great first impression, always be courteous and professional. For more tips on acting an interview, read our article here.

403,How military members can avoid predatory lenders,"After serving overseas, military service members return home to face a new economic reality that often includes, unfortunately, lenders looking to take advantage of their vulnerability.

These so-called predatory lenders, which pop up around military bases, try to entice or deceive young soldiers into taking out loans that impose abusive or unfair terms.

“Predatory lenders like to prey on young military members because they’re often inexperienced with money, have little to no credit and are usually very excited to spend that first paycheck,” said certified financial planner Tara Falcone, founder of the financial education company ReisUP. She is also a former hedge fund analyst and is married to an officer in the U.S. Navy.

The end result is a loan that carries a hefty price tag, with sky-high interest rates and hidden fees. For example, if a soldier is convinced to take out a payday loan, which requires a check dated for the next payday, he could ultimately wind up with an interest rate near 400%. Unscrupulous auto lenders and credit card companies have also been known to target members of the military.

“One of my husband’s sailors came to him one day and told him that a car dealership located near base had convinced him to take out a loan for twice the value of the car ...[at] an interest rate of nearly 20%,” Falcone said.

To remedy the situation, the sailor went to a local federal credit union, got a new loan at a lower rate and then paid off the predatory loan.

“By doing that, they saved over $100 on their car payment every month and over $7,000 in interest over time,” she said.

The government has moved to crack down on predatory lending, enacting the Military Lending Act in 2006. The law caps the interest rate on most consumer loans at 36%, yet military and veteran organizations have recently expressed concern about a lack of lender monitoring.

Last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau stopped checking for compliance with the law. Earlier this year, the CFPB’s new director said the agency lacked explicit supervisory authority and requested that Congress give the CFPB that power.

“What we are seeing is really a pattern of neglect around consumer protections both for consumers generally, who are targeted by payday lenders, but also a disregard for fully implementing the Military Lending Act and making sure military members are not targeted by high-cost, abusive lenders,” said Tom Feltner, director of research at the Center for Responsible Lending.

A CFPB spokesperson said the bureau is “committed to the financial well-being” of U.S. service members.

“This commitment includes ensuring that lenders subject to our jurisdiction comply with the Military Lending Act, so our servicemembers and their families are provided with the protections of that law,” the spokesperson sa However, if you’re in the military, there are some things you can do to ensure you do not become another victim. Not only does predatory lending cause undue financial stress, it can also negatively impact a soldier’s military readiness, said Falcone.

Here are four tips from Falcone that can help servicemembers protect themselves.

1. Be proactive, not reactive

When trying to get a loan, arm yourself with information before you start the process. That means knowing your credit score and familiarizing yourself with current interest rates, as well as the fair value of the item you are going to purchase, Falcone advises.

“Don’t just trust that the lender is going to tell you the right thing,” she said.

2. Know how much you can afford

You need to look beyond just the monthly payment when it comes to figuring out your budget, said Falcone. Instead, know the “all-in cost” that you can afford, which includes taxes, fees and interest.

3. Learn the language of loans

Predatory lenders may try to coerce you into making a commitment by throwing around jargon you may not fully understand. Therefore, before looking into a loan, make sure you know how the process works.

“You need to understand how lenders can manipulate all the different factors in the loan borrowing process — that includes interest, payment and term — in order to sway it in their favor and make it seem like you’re getting a really good deal,” Falcone said.

4. Ask questions

Never take out a loan unless you have the answers to any questions you may have.

“When it comes to your money, you are the authority,” Falcone said. “If you have questions, make sure to ask them and, if anything feels crazy or strange, be prepared to get up and walk away from the deal.”

404,Military spouse turned financial planner on creating wealth,"Transitioning from a civilian life to military life can be difficult, especially as a spouse. As a military spouse you are more or less tied to your partners schedule and are often not in one place long enough to set down roots let alone find a way to earn money. But former hedge fund analyst and wife to an officer in the U.S. Navy, Tara Falcone says spouses of service members do have options when it comes to creating wealth.

Falcone credits her family’s frequent moving as an inspiration to start her own business, ReisUP, as a certified financial planner, “starting my own business gives me the freedom, the freedom of location, of time and of income.”

Work remotely

The first piece of advice Falcone has for spouses is try to find a job that will allow you to work remotely. Thanks to technology it is easy to stay connected to colleagues and teams even if you are on the other side of the world.

Starting or continuing a career can seem daunting but Falcone says, “Today, spouses can and are working from home for companies in virtually every industry and at varying levels of their leadership structure.”

Common career fields include digital marketing, web design, copywriting, business development, finance, and research.

Control your investment plan

You don’t have to have a career to generate wealth for your family. Make sure the you and your service member are contributing enough to your retirement accounts.

These accounts include Thrift Savings Plan which is essentially the government version of a 401(k) plan. The TSP allows federal employees and members of the Armed Forces to save and invest for retirement in tax advantage way.

According to Falcone, the TSP offers two distinct advantages:

There are only six primary investment funds to choose from Each fund has a low expense ratio, which allows participants to keep and compound more of their investment returns.

Protect your wealth

Falcone offered some additional financial planning options and tips in a follow-up email to CNBC.

The 403(b), known as the “hip cousin” of the 401(k), is available to employees of certain schools, hospitals and non-profits.

Spousal IRAs are designed to help non-working or stay-at-home spouses contribute to retirement without having to meet the earned income requirement of a traditional IRA. While the Spousal IRA is not reserved solely for military spouses, the high unemployment rate among military spouses — as high as 24% in recent years — makes it popular.

There is no use in building up wealth if you cannot protect it. It is important to make sure that you and service member have adequate life, health, auto, disability and even pet insurance.

It is also wise to have an emergency fund for rainy days. While the amount of money in the fund can vary, most financial experts recommend at least six months of living expenses.

405,Military families find money matters complex,"Life is financially complicated for many U.S. military troops and their families.

Almost half of service members are under the age of 25, and a high percentage are married with children. They don’t get paid a lot and they must deploy repeatedly to difficult places, many times where their lives are on the line.

What other job makes someone do this?

And to be honest, even if the move isn’t to a dangerous place, it is disruptive and costs money … a lot of money.

Setting up a new household in a new location is a challenge and even more so if it is overseas. All those moves make it very difficult for military spouses to get and keep a job. Those spouses, who find it necessary to work to cover expenses, must deal with employers who know they might move to a new city at any time. That means the employer is hesitant to hire them at all.

On the plus side, troops do get benefits: housing and food allowances and health-care coverage. They may get health care on base, or they may have to use the local doctors and health-care facilities.

More from Invest in You:

And that can all change every time they move, and they do move often. As for housing, they might get a home to live in on a base, or they might get an allowance to find a home in a nearby community.

So, what do they need to do to stay financially ready, for both the military life and after they leave? First, because they tend to live on the edge financially, they need establish an emergency fund. Otherwise, the slightest event puts them in trouble and in debt and, for the troops and their families, those kinds of events can happen often and with no warning.

A service member doesn’t need to worry about the “normal” rules of having three to six months’ worth of expenses in an emergency fund. They aren’t getting laid off, so three months of expenses is an adequate target. It is crucial that service members, like anyone else, stay out of serious debt.

However, service members who find themselves in serious debt are actually considered a security risk by the military and can lose security clearance. To be blunt, service members with no clearance are useless down-range. They lose their careers.

It’s key for those in the military to start on their retirement savings as early as possible.

Starting early puts time and the power of compounding interest on their side. I know that saving for retirement might seem difficult for a struggling young person, but the military offers service members the Thrift Savings Plan. It’s the federal government’s version of the civilian 401(k) plan and will match up of 5% of savings.

By setting aside 5% of their pay in the TSP, matched by the government at 5%, a service member has created a 10% savings rate. That is perfect for the young person just starting out. After a few years, they can increase their contribution to 10% for grand total of 15%. As always, starting early makes it so much easier in the long run.

The current military retirement system is basically what is known as a “defined retirement system.” This just means that you get a set retirement based on the number of years you are on active duty. There are currently three existing retirement systems, depending on when you entered the service.

The challenge these service members face is understanding the various types of benefits they can receive. It can become quite complicated, so it’s important to seek out professional assistance.

Of course, service members need insurance coverage.

Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance is low-cost term insurance for members of the uniformed services. SGLI is a group life insurance policy purchased by the Department of Veterans Affairs from a commercial life insurance company. Each service member entering a period of active duty or reserve status is automatically covered for the maximum $400,000 death benefit. They should consider the least-costly approach (term life insurance) to cover college costs for the kids and the price of a home for their spouse for the family.

Perhaps the most important thing service members and their families, or any young couple, can do is to have a budget. I call it a “spending plan.”

The idea is to spend money with a purpose to achieve your priority goals. It’s not easy to do at the start, but, once you’ve established the habit, it will sustain you for life.

By fully understanding the implications of every spending decision, a service member can keep out of financial trouble. It’s a way to avoid deep debt and will include savings plan as part of their “spending plan.” The plan puts you in control of your money.

Finally, it’s very important to have an estate plan. The Judge Advocate General office (military attorneys) will provide the basics, including important paperwork such as a will, power of attorney, health-care proxy and more.

This is key because estate planning involves making decisions about how your property — real estate, investments, Social Security, cash, life insurance and business interests — is used, maintained and distributed if you become incapacitated and after your death.

Of course, if there are children involved, a trust is often recommended. There are pro bono attorney groups that can help with the more complex issues for service members. It’s worth the time to do the homework and find these groups. There are resources to help, but the troops need to ask.

Most military installations have personal financial counselors who can help to craft a plan. There are also pro bono professional programs from groups such as the Foundation for Financial Planning, Financial Independence Training and the Financial Planning Association that can help at no cost.

Of course, service members need to be willing to ask for some assistance with their money matters. We ask them to serve and protect us, so we financial professionals can use our skills to help them. It’s only fair.

406,Combat Vet shares financial advice for military families,"Being a military service member or veteran comes with a unique set of challenges.

From time away from home and family to dealing with health care and benefits after service, it can be challenging for veterans. The good news is that there are programs available to veterans that can help with saving, investing and building wealth over time.

The following programs are positioned to give a vet some financial guidance:

Blended Retirement System (for active duty and reservists): In January 2018, the traditional military pension system was converted to the Blended Retirement System. The BRS combines elements of the legacy retirement system with benefits similar to those offered in many civilian 401(k) plans.

The program was designed to help the Department of Defense save money by reducing the costs of the existing pension system. Under the old system, a service member would have to stay in for a full 20 years to qualify for the military pension.

Fewer than 20% of service members who enlist actually choose to make the military their career and retire out. The rest would separate from service with no retirement benefits. The BRS changes that.

Here are some pros:

Provides a benefit to service members even if they choose not to spend 20 years in the military.

Includes a government match of 1% on the Thrift Savings Plan, and vesting happens after just two years.

Receive a ""continuation pay"" bonus after 12 years of service that is paid to you as cash.

The pension option is still there for you if you serve for 20 years. There is also a ""lump sum"" payout that is available to you at retirement.

Here are some cons:

Overall retirement benefit from the BRS can be lower than the original pension.

Service members who joined after January 1, 2018 no longer have access to the original pension.

It can be confusing and a bit complicated.

Requires that service members actively participate in their retirement.

Savings Deposit Program (for active duty and reservists): The Savings Deposit Program is a Department of Defense-sponsored savings account that offers deployed military members a guaranteed return on investment of 10% interest, compounded quarterly, on deposits of up to $10,000.

The program is one of the best savings options for young service members who are deployed in active combat zones around the world. The program pays 10% annualized rate of return on the contributions. In addition, the contributions are tax-free as long as they are made in a qualified tax-exempt zone. This offers an easy and effective way to put away $10,000.

Here are some pros:

Guaranteed 10% interest on contributions.

Funds and interest accumulate tax-free while service member is deployed in a qualified tax-exempt area.

Super simple to save because contributions are done through salary allotment.

Interest accrues for up to 90 days after leaving a combat zone.

Here are some cons:

You must be in a combat zone for at least 30 days or 1 day per month for 3 consecutive months to be eligible to participate.

Maximum contribution is limited to $10,000 per deployment.

You cannot make contributions once you leave the combat zone. In addition, you won't have access to the funds for 120 days after your deployment unless your balance is more than $10,000.

If there is a financial emergency, you would have to get permission from your unit commander to get an early distribution.

Thrift Savings Plan (for service members not on the BRS): The Thrift Savings Plan is the federal government's version of the civilian 401(k) plan. The rules are the same regarding contributions, distributions, required minimum distributions and so forth.

The key difference is that the TSP is the only plan that offers access to the Government Securities Investment Fund, or G Fund, in addition to four index funds. The G Fund invests exclusively in U.S. Treasurys, and contributions, as well as interest payments, are guaranteed by the U.S. government. This means that the G Fund cannot lose money. However, the G Fund does still have some risk.

Here are some pros:

It works like a 401(k) plan. Service members who become federal civilian employees may be eligible for a match.

The G Fund is backed by special issue Treasury bills and guaranteed by the U.S. government. It serves as a hedge against market fluctuations.

Service members can contribute while deployed to qualified tax-exempt areas. Contributions made deployed to these areas are tax-free and continue to grow tax-deferred.

Can be rolled over into a traditional individual retirement account or Roth IRA (when applicable).

Here are some cons:

The G Fund is only available in the TSP.

The G Fund is subject to inflation risk. Cost-of-living expense could potentially grow faster than the interest that accrues in the fund.

There is a limited number of investment options and no brokerage option.

There is no match for service members who are on the traditional pension retirement program.

Small Business Administration Express Loan program (for active duty, reservists and veterans): Looking to start, buy or grow a business? The SBA has you covered. An Express loan issued through the SBA 7(a) Express Loan program could give a service member the cash they need to get up and running fast.

The Express Loan Program provides up to $350,000 to start or grow a business and loans can be approved in as little as 36 hours. Service members and veterans get the added benefit of priority processing and having guaranty fees waived. That's a savings of 3% or more on the cost of the loan.

Here are some pros:

Quick turn-around and priority processing for military and veterans.

Up to $350,000 for business (including real estate purchases).

Can be structured as a line of credit or traditional loan depending on the business' needs.

Guaranty fees for SMs and veterans waived.

Here are some cons:

Interest rates may be higher than conventional loan options (SBA interest rate is the prime rate plus 4.5% to 6.5%).

Very specific limits on what can and cannot be done with the loan.

Must have excellent credit and a well-structured business plan to qualify.

Loans limited to $350,000.

407,12 Steps to Starting a Small Business,"Getty Images

Being your own boss can be immensely rewarding. Though the start-up process can seem overwhelming, it can be boiled down to a few key actions. Getting a company up and running requires planning, making important financial decisions, and completing legal paperwork, but you can start by following these 12 steps:

Step 1: Define your business and market demand

Before launching a business, make sure there is a market for your idea. Start by asking yourself a few key questions, including what problem is your business solving? Who is your customer? Who would be your existing main competitors, and how does your idea differ? Do some research to answer these questions and see how your business will stack up. The answers will help you develop an action plan—and possibly tweak your idea—to get your venture off to a successful start.

Step 2: Write a business plan

You don’t need an MBA to write a business plan. In fact, it can be as short and simple as one page. Think of it as a three to five year guide that will help you map out how to start your company and successfully run it. Your business plan should include what goods or services your company will offer, your target customer, how much you will charge, and how you’ll fund and market your product. Do research beforehand to make sure there is enough of a potential customer base. Take a close look at your defined audience and decide whether you’ll exist for a local, national or niche market, and whether you’ll run an e-commerce or physical operation.

Step 3: Fund your business

Capital is necessary to start every company. If you don’t have the cash, look beyond your own wallet. First, determine how much you’ll need and where the money will come from. If you plan to approach investors, perfect your business plan and your elevator pitch. Consider government backed loans, venture capital and research grants, as well as newly popular crowdfunding sites, in which your network of family and friends contribute to start-up costs. As a veteran, you’re entitled to a special U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loan, called Patriot Express.

Step 4: Determine your business structure

Decide which form of ownership is best for you: sole proprietorship, partnership, Limited Liability Company (LLC), corporation, S corporation, nonprofit or cooperative. Your business type determines which income tax you’ll file. Each type of business structure has its pros and cons, so it’s best to consult an accountant and a lawyer, if possible.

Step 5: Choose and register a business name

A name says a lot about your business, but there’s more to picking one than being catchy—it has to be legally available. To make sure someone else doesn’t own it, check online at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. However, you can still infringe on someone else’s trademark even if it’s not registered there, so also search state and local databases. When choosing a name, keep branding in mind; the title should be clear, easy to remember and spell, and something you can grow with.

In addition to selecting your business name, you may also need to register a fictitious business name, known as a DBA (Doing Business As). A DBA is needed when your company does business under a different name, and if the company name is different from your own name.

Finally, make sure your business name is available as a web domain (omitting hyphens, if possible), then register it immediately. If the dot.com suffix is taken, try dot.net or another suffix. Avoid dot.org, unless you’re filing as a non-profit. Once your business name and domain are finalized, make business cards. They should include your name, address, email address, website, phone number, and social media links, like your Facebook page or Twitter handle. Some also include a short phrase describing their company.

Step 6: Create a marketing plan

Thanks to social media, marketing has gotten a lot easier. Build your brand’s name by expanding your company’s online presence. Create a website, a Facebook page and Twitter account, and depending on the nature of your company, considering using Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest as well. By interacting directly with your market, customers will feel more engaged. Update your website and social media accounts frequently, and read up on SEO (search engine optimization) to maximize your web presence. Another effective tactic is email marketing: Build a list of potential customers, business associates and colleagues (you can have them sign up on your website), and send them regular updates.

Step 7: Get a Tax Identification Number

To mark your business as a separate legal entity, you’ll need to obtain a Federal Tax Identification Number, also referred to as an Employer Identification Number (EIN). Similar to a social security number, a tax ID lets the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) track business transactions. Though they aren’t mandatory for sole proprietors, they’re recommended so that you don’t have to use your social security number for business practices. The application process is free, quick and simple; apply online at the IRS website.

Step 8: Open a business bank account

Never mix your personal and business bank accounts, which could lead to a run-in with the IRS and affect your mortgage and loan payments, as well as other personal finances. Instead, use a business bank account for all of your company’s transactions. Open one in the name of your business and EIN. Additionally, you may want to open a business credit card to avoid using a personal one for company matters.

Step 9: Figure out your taxes

Your business structure will determine the types of taxes you’ll have to pay. All businesses, except for partnerships, are required to file an annual income tax return. Depending on whether or not you have employees, you may also have to pay employment taxes (which include social security and Medicare taxes) and a self-employment tax. Additionally, decide if you’ll pay taxes according to the calendar year or the fiscal year (you can determine that schedule).

Step 10: Get the necessary licenses and permits

While every locality has different requirements, all demand business licenses—even if yours only exists online. Make a list of federal, state and local licenses and permits required for your business. (Find more information here.) If you have a physical storefront, familiarize yourself with zoning laws from the county clerk’s office. Use your company’s EIN instead of your Social Security number when filing paperwork.

Step 11: Learn relevant laws and regulations

If you’re starting an online business, contact the Federal Trade Commission to learn about e-commerce regulations.

If you’re hiring employees, spend time with an employment law professional to learn and understand the legal steps you need to take. Familiarize yourself with federal and state payroll and withholding taxes, unemployment insurance, anti-discrimination laws, workers’ compensation rules, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations, and wage and hour requirements.

Step 12: Set up your accounting system

Bookkeeping can be simple, at least when you first start your business. Begin with an Excel spreadsheet that lets you track money you spend and receive; include columns for revenues and expenses, and add more as you go. When you’re ready for a more formal system, invest in business accounting software like QuickBooks.

408,Military families say this is their top concern,"Members of the military face hurdles every day — and financial challenges are among some of the biggest.

Eric Wanner, a sergeant in the U.S. Army, and his wife, Jana, have moved four times in the last 12 years — most recently to Fort Meade in Anne Arundel County, Maryland.

Because of frequent deployments and moving expenses, as well as cost-of-living adjustments and erratic pay, the couple struggles when it comes to managing their household finances.They are raising a family on a single military income.

For example, “when we came back from overseas we had to rent a car for two months while we waited for our other car to get shipped,” said Jana Wanner. “That was a massive expense.”

In fact,service members and their spouses ranked financial stress as their greatest concern, even over deployment, according to Blue Star Families’ annual military family lifestyle survey.

Members of the Arizona National Guard listen to instructions on April 9, 2018, at the Papago Park Military Reservation in Phoenix. - Arizona deployed its first 225 National Guard members to the Mexican border on Monday after President Donald Trump ordered thousands of troops to the frontier region to combat drug trafficking and illegal immigration.

Nearly 9 in 10 active service members and 84% of spouses or partners have worries about personal finances, according to a separate report by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, which also did the same survey of military personnel five years ago.

Rather than have some of those challenges subside as the economy improved, more military families are worried about meeting basic household needs and debt payments today than in 2014, the NFCC found.

In fact, service members are now twice as likely not to be able to pay all their bills on time than they were just a few years ago.

Roughly 3 in 10 spouses or partners of service members said they do not pay their bills on time and about 1 in 10 said they currently have debts in collection, according to the survey.

Still, because of issues such as increased childcare costs during periods of deployment and the likelihood of relocation, it can be hard for spouses to find full-time employment to supplement their military incomes and build retirement savings.

As a result, about half of service members and their spouses of service members say they rely on the gig economy to stay afloat, the NFCC found.

In general, people are struggling to make ends meet, said Rebecca Steele, president and CEO of the NFCC. That’s “amplified in military households.”

“Men and women in uniform face many challenges and daily sacrifices while serving our country,” she added. “Financial concerns shouldn’t be one of them.”

To that end, Josh Andrews, a certified financial planner and advice director at financial services firm USAA in San Antonio, offers the following tips to active duty military and their spouses or partners:

Start early

Beginning with your first paycheck, opt to take the full Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance coverage amount and increase automatic contributions to the military’s Thrift Savings Plan to at least 10%.

With what is left, learn to live well within your means — spend less than you earn and put what you can into an emergency fund.

Pay down debt

If you do have debt, develop an attack strategy. Figure out which loans are costing you the most, and make it a priority to pay those off first.

Payday loans, also called cash advances, are the worst offenders, with interest rates that can easily run into the triple digits.

Plan for the inevitable

Consider where you will be living with every Permanent Change of Station, or PCS, and then adjust your budget accordingly.

From groceries to gasoline, the cost of living can vary substantially by location.

Take a long-term view

The majority of those in the military do not serve until retirement. Consider other education options and training programs and make sure a transition plan for benefits, including health insurance and pensions, is secured before departure from the service.

You can keep on top of the many benefits the military offers, as well as whatever financial education it makes available, through Military OneSourceor other channels.

For its part, the NFCC offers financial education and credit counseling through its member agencies.

Institutions such as USAA also regularly work with current and former service members and offer a range of banking and insurance products.

And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau site for service members has many resources related to protecting finances and planning for the future.

410,'Captain Tom': Funeral held for U.K. war veteran who raised millions for health service,"LONDON — ""I told you I was old,"" will be the epitaph on the headstone of Captain Sir Tom Moore, the British veteran who made headlines around the world after he raised millions for the U.K.'s health service, during the coronavirus pandemic.

Moore, whose funeral took place Saturday, chose the words before he died aged 100 on Feb. 2, in a hospital in England after testing positive for Covid-19.

Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's parliament and the White House, which said he had ""inspired millions through his life and his actions,"" all paid tribute to the World War Two veteran on news of his death earlier this month.

Dressed in a dapper blazer and tie and displaying his World War II medals, Moore struck a chord with locked-down Britons last year, as he walked up and down the garden of his home in Marston Moretaine, a small village around 50 miles north of London, to raise money for the National Health Service.

Having initially aimed to raise just 1,000 pounds ($1,400) he would go on to raise almost 33 million ($46 million).

With a mischievous wit and steely determination, he lifted public spirits and was hailed a national hero. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in July.

Moore's funeral, which he played a significant role in planning, was held at the Bedford Crematorium near his home.

In keeping with Britain's Covid-19 restrictions, just eight members of his immediate family attended the funeral, his two daughters Hannah Ingram-Moore and Lucy Teixeira, four grandchildren and his sons-in-law — all wearing face masks.

Draped in a union flag, his coffin was carried by soldiers while a World War II-era C-47 Dakota plane performed an honorary fly-past.

Reflecting his humor, Moore's epitaph will read: ""I told you I was old,"" a reference to British comedian Spike Milligan's famous epitaph: ""I told you I was ill."" Moore was a big fan, his family said.

They have also supported a global initiative to plant millions of trees, so that his legacy can live on.

Raised in the U.K.'s northern county of Yorkshire, Moore served in India, Burma and Sumatra during the war.

After his garden walking exploits drew praise, he went on to record a number one pop song and author a book.

""The last year of our father's life was nothing short of remarkable. He was rejuvenated and experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of,"" his daughters said following his death.

411,Why veterans struggle to share their stories with their kids,"Lt. Col. Paul Huszar had been on a mission for nearly 20 hours. Exhausted, he was riding in the second of four military vehicles making their way back to Joint Base Balad, about 60 miles north of Baghdad, Iraq.

It would take Huszar years to process what happened next. Like many veterans, he avoided speaking openly about his combat experiences because he didn't want to worry his family.

As the convoy rolled back to Balad, Huszar saw a flash of green light and heard a loud explosion. The first vehicle in the caravan had struck an improvised explosive device.

“This green flash of smoke goes off and it blows the truck up in front of us,” Huszar recalled of the 2010 incident. “It blew off all the tires and disabled the vehicle.”

Huszar, at the time a U.S. Army battalion commander in charge of 1,000 soldiers, quickly instructed his team to use infrared cameras and other technology to find any additional threats before helping their fellow soldiers. Fortunately, no one was hurt. As Huszar exited his vehicle and began walking, he looked down at his feet and saw what appeared to be a piece of exposed metal.

“I just said, ‘Hey, everybody halt!’” the combat veteran told TODAY Parents. “I think I almost stepped on a mortar round.”

Once he made it back to the base, Huszar gave his wife, Elise, a brief overview of what had happened. Almost immediately, he began worrying about the questions he knew would eventually come from other family members and friends — and, most significantly, from his kids. He wondered how he’d ever be able to tell them about what happened in Iraq.

Dr. Shannon Curry, a clinical psychologist specializing in war-related trauma and PTSD, said it’s common for combat veterans to struggle to open up with their children and other loved ones about what they’ve experienced. This is because war causes such profound psychological stress.

“The experiences of war can be horrifying, confusing and — what most service members aren't prepared for — embarrassing,” Curry told TODAY Parents. “PTSD or not, they all have experiences they weren’t prepared for. They come out thinking something they felt, thought or experienced wasn’t right or wasn’t normal, and it becomes this deep dark secret.”

Curry said many veterans suffer in silence for years.

“That shame turns into loneliness,” she explained. “Deep down, they assume that if anyone knew the whole story, that they would judge them negatively.”

Buried stories of Vietnam

Bill George, a 71-year-old U.S. Air Force and Army veteran, said he and other combat veterans he knows have blocked out certain memories.

“You aren’t able to recall the blood or the wounds,” George said, describing the selective recall as “a protective device from God.” “I personally don’t remember a lot. Stories told to me about what I did or how I behaved under certain circumstances have become ‘my’ memory.”

George credits Staff Sgt. George Renfroe with his recollection of the events from September 1970 when they were enlisted in the Air Force as part of the 17th Special Operations Squadron in Vietnam.

“We were in a church with about a dozen others when a nearby explosion shook the building,” George told TODAY Parents from his home in Hawaii. “All of us were on the ground under the pews and George looked at me. I looked at him and said, ‘What do we do?’”

When George and Renfroe got up to investigate, their discovery was gruesome.

“About 100 yards away, we found ‘debris’ — a boot with bone sticking out, shreds of material, a depression about half the size of a soccer ball in the packed earth, pieces of metal,” he recalled. “The (deceased) Airman ... took a direct hit from a 122mm rocket.”

George’s experience in Vietnam would be buried for decades.

“I was a PTSD denier. My wife and my kids never knew what I did for many years,” George said of his years in combat. “I kind of clammed into a shell. I was in my late 40s or early 50s before I started to talk to with guys I went to war with. The reason why was because in my memories, I was like a dictator. I was afraid to see how these guys would react (to me) — that’s why I never made contact. When I went, it was the opposite. They said things like, ‘You saved my life.’”

Curry confirmed that many people who experience trauma have difficulty remembering segments of past traumatic events.

“Our brains do occasionally take measures to protect us from severe psychological trauma, and dissociating during a traumatic experience is one of the more common examples of this,” she said. “The individual experiencing the trauma is in an altered state of consciousness which serves the function of lessening their distress in the immediate moment.”

Why sharing can be so healing

Facing up to past experiences and talking about them openly, as George did, can mark an important turning point for combat veterans.

“We thrive when we feel connected to and understood by our fellow human beings, and we suffer immensely when we are harmed or do harm to others,” Curry said. “The human psyche is not intended to experience the horrors of war. Exposure to prolonged and intense combat is traumatic, regardless of whether the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD is met. Not surprisingly, as social creatures, sharing our experiences happens to be one of the healing activities we can do.”

Today, Huszar, 52, of Tampa, Florida, makes an effort to share his combat experiences with others. He feels it’s important to do so, because so many Americans don’t have an accurate understanding of war.

“That’s one of the challenges we have: The rest of society doesn’t have a clue, so it’s hard to share those experiences in general,” Huszar said. “I always told my soldiers if you don’t tell your story, the only thing American people are going to know about you is what they see in movies.”

Huszar said fielding questions from his children — Grant, 22, and Madison, 20 — continues to be challenging for him a decade later. Still, he does his best to answer them honestly and incorporate humor whenever he can.

“I have a piece of shrapnel from that mortar round (I almost stepped on) and it’s on my bar,” Huszar said with a laugh. “Why? So I can tell this story now.”
